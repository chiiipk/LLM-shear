The initial version of Graham-Cassidy reveals that it created a system in which, using a new temporary block grant, all states would receive the amount of federal resources necessary to provide coverage to certain individuals who would be ineligible for Medicaid. Moving forward, Congress needs to craft responsible reforms to bring long-term stability and predictability to the individual market.\nThe decision not to put the bill to a vote in the Senate came a day after Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), would have violated the federal government's trust and treaty responsibility by gutting the ACA and taking away health care from hundreds of thousands of Native Americans, Udall said.\nAccording to Avalere's study, children will see funding slashed by an astonishing 31 percent by 2036.\nPark Square was lined with people opposing the new federal health care proposal.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday that it is projecting as much as a five percent price hike for some food items over the next nine months.\n“Of course I’m concerned,” said shopper Barbara Webb. “I’m concerned for the people who can’t afford it.”\nBehind the expensive jump is the drought, now covering 60 percent of the United States, pushing up prices for feed that translate into higher prices for beef, pork and chicken products.\nBeef prices will see the biggest hike, up four to five percent, according to the USDA. That means the ground beef purchased last year for $2.77 per pound will cost consumers $3.04 per pound next year.\nDairy product prices will increase by 3.5 to 4.5 percent, bumping a gallon of milk from $3.57 in 2011 to $3.84 in 2013.\nThe price of eggs will also go up by three to four percent, making a dozen eggs $1.95 per dozen in 2013, compared with $1.77 in 2011.\nIf USDA’s economists are correct, a family who spends $150 per week on groceries will now be spending $160 by next year, bumping their annual food budget up more than $500.\nLisa Lee Freeman, editor-in-chief of ShopSmart magazine, has a few tips for families trying to keep their grocery bills down, despite the anticipated hike.\n\"The best thing you can do is if all you’re doing is clipping coupons in newspapers -- go online!” Freeman said. “There are literally hundreds of coupons online and if you’re not tapping that, you’re missing out on a huge resource for savings.”\nFreeman also recommends buying store brands in supermarkets, joining warehouse clubs and even shopping at dollar stores to save the most money.\n\"Things are changing and the dollar stores are now carrying brand name items,” Freeman said. “Prices can be up to one-third cheaper at the dollar store than at the supermarket.”\nThe 2013 food price forecast projects an overall food price hike of three to four percent, higher than the normal annual grocery inflation of 2.8 percent.\nThe recent announcement is also the USDA’s first projection to factor in the drought.\nDavid Lobell, writes studies for Climate Central, monitoring global warming. He says farmers should prepare for tougher growing conditions and higher prices in the future.\n\"This year is very emblematic of the type of thing we worry about with climate change,” Lobell said. “The new normal for agriculture is going to be frequent episodes of very high temperatures.

These days, less of it is being found in the kitchens of the average American family, much to the consternation of cattle ranchers and meat packers.\nThere's no question that the nation's beef consumption habits have changed over the past decade for health reasons. Another problem for the beef industry: the down economy and a fall-off in business of restaurants with main courses of steaks and other meat dishes.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, per capita beef consumption in 2011 was 57.4 pounds per person, a drop of 13 percent from 2001. It's believed that the decline will continue next year by at least another five to six percent from 2011.\nThe beef industry has responded by developing cuts of meat that will satisfy steak lovers at lower prices. Sales of cheaper ground beef have also risen substantially.\nMeanwhile, the industry is also looking outside the U.S. to bolster business.

One of the hotels is known to be popular with Israeli tourists.\n\"There were three terrorist attacks on the Grand Hyatt, Radisson SAS and Days Inn hotels, and it is believed that the blasts were suicide bombings,\" police spokesman Major Bashir al-Da'aja told The Associated Press. He declined to elaborate.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks.\nA police official said the attacks were simultaneous and hit minutes before 9 P.M. in two districts in the Jordanian capital, including the commercial area of Jebel Amman and Al-Rabiyeh, which houses the Israeli Embassy.\nA number of Israelis staying yesterday at the Radisson SAS were evacuated before the bombing by Jordanian security forces, apparently due to a specific security alert. They were escorted back to Israel by security personnel.\nThe Foreign Ministry stated yesterday that no Israeli tourists are known to have been injured in the blasts. Representatives of Israel's embassy in Amman were in contact with local authorities to examine any report of injured Israelis, but none were received. There are often a number of Israeli businessman and tourists in Amman, including in the hotels hit yesterday.\nIsrael's counter-terror headquarters yesterday recommended Israeli citizens not travel in Jordan. Travel recommendations regarding Jordan were tightened a few months ago, but many Israelis still visit the country. Many also visit other regions such as the Jordanian Arava and the ancient city of Petra.\nThe first bomber, at 8:50 P.M. local time, struck the Grand Hyatt, completely shattering the stone entrance. An AP reporter saw at least seven bodies removed from the hotel and many more wounded carried out on stretchers.\nCNN reported an eyewitness saying the Jordanian prime minister's car was at the Grand Hyatt at the time of the blast.\nPolice said a second explosion hit the nearby Radisson SAS hotel, where about 250 people were attending a wedding reception. At least five were killed and at least 20 wounded in that blast, believed to have been caused by a bomb placed in a false ceiling, police sources at the scene told Reuters.\nThe Radisson, in particular, is popular with Israeli tourists and was a target of several foiled Al-Qaida plots in the past.\nPolice also reported a third explosion at the Days Inn Hotel in Amman. There were also casualties at that hotel.\n\"The attacks carry the trademark of Al-Qaida,\" one police official said on condition of anonymity in line with police regulations. \"However, it is not certain. We are investigating.\"\nAyman al-Safadi, editor of Jordan's Al-Ghad newspaper, told the Al-Arabiya satellite network that it was a \"terrorist operation.\"\n\"Finally, the terrorists succeeded in breaking the security in Jordan,\" he said, referring to past success in foiling many terror plots.\nJordan's King Abdullah II condemned the attack, saying, \"Justice will pursue the criminals\" behind the Amman suicide attacks, CNN reported. Abdullah, who was on an official visit to Kazakhstan, cut short his trip and was returning home last night.\nThe Grand Hyatt and Radisson SAS hotels, in the commercial Jebel Amman district, are located about one kilometer apart and are frequented by American and European businessmen and diplomats. The Days Inn is located three kilometers away.\nAn American businessman who was at the Grand Hyatt when the explosion occurred said a \"bomb that went off in the lobby.\" He declined to identify himself.\n\"It was a miracle that we made it out with a scratch,\" said a British guest at the Grand Hyatt.\n\"We thought it was fireworks for the wedding but I saw people falling to the ground,\" said Ahmed, a wedding guest at the\nRadisson who did not give his surname. \"I saw blood. There were people killed. It was ugly.\"\nJordan, a key ally of both the United States and Israel, had largely escaped the terror attacks that have hit other parts of the Middle East, and its sleepy capital, Amman, is viewed as a haven of stability in the region.\nBut Jordan has not been entirely immune: On Aug. 19, militants fired three Katyusha rockets at a U.S. Navy ship docked at the Red Sea resort of Aqaba, narrowly missing it and killing a Jordanian soldier.\nJordanian officials blamed that attack on Al-Qaida in Iraq, and there have been growing worries that the violence in Iraq could spill over into Jordan, where many Iraqi exiles have taken refuge from the violence.\nhttp://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/643691.html\nWho died, and who didn't, in Jordan\nThere is an excellent summary of some peculiarities in the Jordan bombings in Xiaodong People, tying it to warnings given to Israelis in other recent 'terrorist' attacks (we might add the Odigo 9-11 warnings). The original story that the Israelis received warnings has been whitewashed, and the link replaced by a denial. There is, however, reported confirmation of advance warning from Amos N. Guiora, a former senior Israeli counter-terrorism official. You have to wonder why the Israelis chose not to share their wonderful intelligence with the Jordanians (in much the same way that you might wonder why they didn't go into more detail in their warnings to the United States on 9-11, particularly as their intelligence was apparently good enough and specific enough to be able to send Israeli agents to film the attack on the WTC, not to mention cheer it on). The attack did manage to kill the head of the Palestinian intelligence services (not to mention a Palestinian banker and a Palestinian commercial attache), and members of a delegation from China's University of National Defense, with whom the Palestinians might be assumed to be meeting (or at least the Israelis might have so assumed; see Kurt Nimmo on the Chinese connection). Since at least one of the bombs was pre-planted in a ceiling of the hotel, it would be very interesting to know who owned the hotel and could give access to bomb planters. The Jordanian reaction, to blame it all on the same dead man the Americans use as the scapegoat in Iraq, is probably a reflection of the extremely close ties between the CIA and Jordan's General Intelligence Directorate. I think we can probably chalk this one up to the continuing battle between the Israelis and the Palestinians over who gets to be protected by China after the American Empire collapses under the weight of trying to build the Israeli Empire.","source":"cc/2019-30/en_head_0000.json.gz/line14"}

Set in New York in the 1930s, Phelan's gorgeous artwork will sweep you away into a familiar story, but with a lot of interesting changes on the characters and story you love. In this interview with Teenreads.com's Dana Cuadrado, Matt Phelan shares his inspiration for his \"Snow White\" reimagining as well as his artistic process in illustrating the story.\nDana Cuadrado: Fairy tale retellings are hugely popular these days, especially for young adults. What inspired you to take on your own retelling and why did you choose Snow White?\nMatt Phelan: The story of “Snow White” has wonderful layers to it. I particularly like that she is not alone. She inspires others and they help her. That aspect always set it apart for me.\nThere are many, many versions of “Snow White” in the world. Why do another one? For me, the driving force was the idea that --- no matter how dark or oppressive the world is --- there are still good people and furthermore, I believe, more good people than evil. It’s the goodness of Snow and her optimism that conquers the evil. It’s an important thing to remember in today’s world.\nDC: Your artistic style and the historical settings were highlights for me when reading your book. What inspired you to set Snow White in the 1930s? How did you do your research on the time period?\nMP: One day I made the connection between the apple peddlers of the Great Depression and the evil stepmother in “Snow White”. I made a sketch, just for my own amusement, of a crowded city street and one young woman stopped by a very haggard looking peddler holding up a deep red apple. From that, I started to think of more ways “Snow White” could translate to that period. Who is the Queen? The Queen of the Ziegfeld Follies. Who are the Seven Dwarfs? Seven street kids, like the Dead End Gang of the movies. It was almost a game, but eventually I became fascinated about how that approach could change the story and how I might be able to add something to the tale. The Seven and the fact that they keep their names a secret (a sharp contrast to the Disney version) was really the key.\nThe 1920s, ‘30s, and even the ‘40s have always fascinated me, due mostly to my lifetime love of movies from that time. (I’m also a huge fan of the music, art, and fashions of that era). As a result, I think I can “put” myself into that time period fairly easily. For the look of this book, I was influenced less by the glossy Art Deco style and more by the darker 1930s films like Fritz Lang’s M, John Ford’s The Informer, and King Kong.\nDC: Many of the story choices in SNOW WHITE were really fresh and modern. What specifically did you want to bring to a story that has been retold so many times to revitalize it and make it your own?\nMP: I guess the most drastic change I made was getting rid of the “fairest in the land” motivation. Since the Queen is an ex-Broadway star, I felt that she would have always been surrounded by upcoming young ingénues. That’s part of the game. Greed and social position are more powerful motivations for an aging star in the Great Depression. That led to changing the magic mirror to the ticker tape machine (although I do give her a room that is filled with nothing but mirrors). The other thing that bothered me about the fairest in the land angle was that it seems pretty shallow. Does the huntsman spare Snow because she’s pretty? No. There had to be something more to her. Snow is an innately good person in a dark and hopeless world. That is what inspires the huntsman and the Seven to help her.\nDC: All of your characters were really well-thought out and developed, but I especially loved the Evil Queen character --- her eyes were incredibly expressive! Which character are you most fond of?\nMP: Thank you. I resisted any urge to give the Queen a backstory to make her sympathetic. She is not a good person.\nI’ve always had a fondness for the huntsman character. In my version, Mr. Hunt is a goon, a thug who fell in love with the Queen while working backstage at the Follies. I think he’s been doing her dirty work for years, but he draws the line at murdering Snow. He’s the tragic hero of the story. Plus, it’s just fun to draw a mug like that.\nDC: Your artwork is beautiful and must be very time consuming; which panel took you the longest to complete? How many drafts does it take from start to finish for a graphic novel?\nMP: I always write a manuscript first before drawing anything. SNOW WHITE has been in the back of my mind for maybe ten years, so when I finally sat down to write it (a month or so after finishing the art for BLUFFTON) it came out fairly quickly and intact. The entire book took about three years to create.\nAlthough drawing a graphic novel is incredibly time consuming, I wanted to work quickly on each panel. I wanted a certain energy to the line and the watercolor. I wanted it to be alive. To make the dummy, I sketched the whole thing in very small, loose drawings using black and white pencils on grey paper. The sketches really had life (part of me wanted to just print those). So, in order to give the finals the same energy, I drew each page without using a light-box or a guide sketch except for just looking at those small drawings for inspiration. If I messed up, I redrew it. But working that way --- that uncertainty of pulling it off --- made each panel exciting to draw and paint.\nDC: From looking at your past work, it is clear that you have a personality and style that carries throughout all of your work. Can you describe your artistic style and influences?\nMP: I’ve always loved sketches and art that has a “just enough” quality to it. E.H. Shepard (the illustrator of WINNIE-THE-POOH and THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS) is a great example. Shepard also managed to convey a tremendous amount of warmth and emotion in his drawings and that emotional connection is also something I aspire too in my work. Recently, I’ve been studying the drawings of China and Japan. It astounds me how simple and perfect those drawings are especially when compared to what was happening in the west in, say, the 12th century. In his STORY OF ART, E.H. Gombrich writes that the Chinese artists were not interested in detail or realism of any kind. They were more interested in “the visual traces of the artist’s enthusiasm”. I love that.\nI’m also influenced (in style and storytelling) by the movies of the Golden Age: Orson Welles, Buster Keaton, Billy Wilder, John Ford, and some of Hitchcock (particularly Notorious and Shadow of a Doubt).\nDC: Do you come from a naturally artistic and creative family? How did you get your start as a writer/illustrator?\nMP: My home was very creative but not in a pushy way. My mom drew and painted for fun. My dad made Super 8 movies in his spare time. My brother is a musician. I drew and had a workshop in the basement where I built puppets and experimented with stop-motion animation and special effects. I was always making something or gathering friends to shoot a short video in the backyard.\nIn my mid- to late-twenties I realized that my dream job was to be a picture book illustrator. I spent years putting a portfolio together before getting my break at a Society of Children’s Book Writers & Illustrators (SCBWI) event. I was 33 at the time and well into a “real” career. I never let go of the idea that I wanted to earn my living doing creative work and that tenacity paid off eventually.\nDC: Since you have illustrated other author’s stories as well writing and illustrating your own, which would you say is harder to do? Which do you prefer?\nMP: I really do enjoy both since they exercise different muscles. When you illustrate someone else’s story there is a great responsibility to identify the tone and intention of the author. It’s almost like a puzzle. But then you need to bring something to that, to enhance the story. When it’s successful, the picture book really is a collaboration between the writer and the artist. That can be very exciting and satisfying. When it’s also your story, you still need to discover the right tone but you are 100% sure of the intention from the beginning.\nDC: What advice would you give for aspiring artists and writers?\nMP: Draw and write. Look at books but don’t copy styles or follow trends. Find what you love about this work and focus on that. Be enthusiastic. Make sure you leave visual traces of your enthusiasm.\nDC: What are you currently working on? What is your next project?\nMP: I’m working on some new stories for older audiences but it’s too soon to talk details. For SNOW WHITE, I brought some techniques from picture books into the graphic novel medium (I don’t really separate the two in my mind aside from the age of the intended audience). I’m interested in experimenting with more hybrid forms of storytelling as well as traditional illustrated chapter books.\nThis year has been devoted to work on four picture books which is pure bliss. In addition to three wonderful stories written by others, I’m finishing my own picture book which is called PIGNIC. It’s about… well, pigs on a picnic. It’s for very young children which is a wonderful challenge. The theme of the book is that despite setbacks, everything will be okay.

Konstantinos composed a contemporary jazz concept-album, with an often dark, programmatic intention, that allures the listener to dive deep into his senses. The arrangement retains an unrefined classic jazz sound, and the instrumentation includes a double bass, piano and drums that blend perfectly with the composer’s fat sounding, tenor saxophone and strong influence of the ECM Jazz label.\nBeen a very creative person, Konstantinos loves music as well as High-End Audio, and he has been involved in various music projects, and has also designed High-End Audio Equipment for consumer and professional use. He supervised the whole production process of the album, and imprinted his personal standpoint in the sound of the album. Darkness of a Fairy Tale retains a live feel with the calmness and focus of a studio album, making it the best of both worlds. Darkness of a Fairy Tale is released in an aesthetic digipak audio-CD featuring cover art from the stunning original painting “Jours et Nuits No4” (acryl on canvas, 1996, Vangelis Papachristos) and also on every popular digital music store world wide.\nYou can like Konstantinos’ facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/KonstPapachristou/\nΤελευταίες κυκλοφορίες\nKaisarias str 101, 18450 Nikaia, Greece","source":"cc/2019-30/en_head_0000.json.gz/line26"}
