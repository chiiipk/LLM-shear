{"text": "The design is part of the complex set of upgrading and territorial innovation actions promoted at the Universal Exposition 2015, aimed at enhancing the Lombard territory as a whole and, in particular, at ensuring the necessary access roads.\nThe design pursues full integration of the exhibition center Expo 2015 with the territory, ensuring proper access to the site by means of an expressway with approx. 3 km length, located northwest of Milan, close to the new Exhibition Center in Rho-Pero.\nFrom a merely road perspective, the link is a natural continuation of the alternative route to the S.S. 11 'Padana Superiore' in the municipality of Milan, as it originates from the intersection of the latter with the S.S. 33 'del Sempione'.\nDuring the upgrading stage, the route initially develops in an artificial tunnel passing under the area of the Integrated Intervention Plan in Cascina Merlata; then it joins the design roads for the new junction on the A4 Milan-Turin as well as with a primary municipal road under development in the municipality of Milan (interdistrict road). Subsequently, passing over the FS railway station Milano Certosa of the Milan-Novara line, the A4 motorway and the EXPO 2015 area, it ends with a partial junction on the A8 'Milano Laghi' motorway in north direction.\nThe layout has been designed in such a way that, in the future, an extension would be possible to reach the S.S. 233 'Varesina' and the SP 40 'Rho-Monza'.\nThe main works included in the design are the artificial tunnel passing under the area of the Integrated Intervention Plan in Cascina Merlata and the viaduct originating south of the intersected railway line and ending at the A8 motorway.\nBuilt with the characteristic excavation method 'Milan type' (which allows to minimize construction times and impact on the territory during the works) and the innovative system of the 'white tank' (thanks to which waterproof concrete can be obtained already during processing), the artificial tunnel develops for approx. 1 km, bypassing the S.S.33 del Sempione and joining the roads leading to the Western by-pass road at Molino Dorino.\nThe system of bridges and viaducts is made of a series of steel arches: for the bridges on the A4 and A8 motorways, these elements have a structural function; while along the EXPO viaduct they only have an aesthetic function, aimed at making the whole project look organic and well fitted into the urban context of 'EXPO 2015' and creating the so-called 'Door of Milan' (a distinctive element for those who drive on the road from and to the city center).\nThe whole elevated system is made even more homogeneous and characteristic by the covering 'guard' of the decks, an external metal coating of Alucobond that ensures continuity among the works. Thanks to specific lighting studies, the presence of this element helps create an appealing play of light during the evening and in the night.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T15:16:46Z", "url": "http://www.proiter.it/en/expo2015.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "On a spring-like day in March, CPT\u2019s founding director Gene Stoltzfus completed his journey on earth at the age of 70. His heart stopped while he was riding his bicycle near his home in Fort Frances, Ontario. He is survived by his wife Dorothy Friesen and many, many peacemakers who stand on the broad shoulders of his lifetime of creative action.\nGene nurtured and shaped Christian Peacemaker Teams from its beginning almost 25 years ago. As director for the first 16 years of CPT\u2019s organizational life, Gene\u2019s vision, ideas, and initiatives laid a strong foundation for our present work. His style, faith, humor, strengths, shortcomings and quirks are embedded in CPT. His hand remains evident in CPT\u2019s training and deployment of long-term, diverse, disciplined and empowered teams; in team and office meals and shared check-ins; in CPT\u2019s creative direct action to reduce violence and highlight injustice; in patterns of prayer and mutual support sending each other out truly blessed; in CPT\u2019s attentiveness to exposing privilege and undoing oppression; and in CPT\u2019s deep roots of connection throughout the Church, which is in turn transformed into a hotbed of peacemaking.\nGene brought tremendous energy, courage and commitment to the work of Christian peacemaking. During his tenure as director, CPT grew from a dream and a dialog about active peacemaking, to sustaining and supporting full-time field teams with hundreds of trained CPTers working in partnership with local peacemakers in conflict zones across the globe.\nGene saw a military culture worldwide and asked how the church could create a counter-culture. He held out a vision of a world free from war and successfully passed that vision on to a new generation of CPTers. He saw in us, and helped us become, competent, capable peacemakers. We imagine him now, already organizing the Celestial Peacemaker Teams.\nThank-you, Gene.

{"text": "Alan Beattie reported on Friday at the Financial Times Online that, \u201cBrazil said on Thursday that it would suspend sanctions on US imports in retaliation for illegal American cotton subsidies, temporarily defusing one of the most contentious disputes in international trade.\n\u201cThe deal will extend until 2012 a holding arrangement in which the US pays Brazilian farmers $147.3m a year and promises to cut subsidies in future. In return, Brazil will hold off imposing blocks on imports or ignoring patents and copyrights, which it is entitled to do after a World Trade Organisation panel declared the US cotton support programme illegal.\nDTN Political Correspondent Jerry Hagstrom reported on Friday (link requires subscription) that, \u201cAs USDA officials and crop insurance executives prepared to meet in Kansas City Friday to discuss USDA\u2019s final offer of a new crop insurance contract, Agriculture Undersecretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Jim Miller and Rep. Jerry Moran sparred Thursday over whether CBO will credit the farm bill baseline with $2 billion the Obama administration intends to repurpose from crop insurance to other programs.\n(FarmPolicy.com Note: At an April 21 House Ag Committee hearing, Sec. Vilsack indicated in a response to a question regarding crop insurance and the baseline that, \u201cAs it relates to the baseline, just simply let me say that our hope is that we can work with the chairman and others on this committee and conserve and preserve these savings so that you all have the flexibility to do what you need to do as you begin to address the 2012 Farm Bill and Rural Development Bill with as much flexibility as you possibly need.\u201d (Unofficial Farmpolicy.com transcript, at page 27)).\nWilliam Neuman reported on Friday at The New York Times Online that, \u201cThe Obama administration proposed new rules on Friday seeking to increase competition and rein in potentially unfair practices by large meatpackers and poultry processors. The move is aimed at helping small livestock and poultry farmers survive in an industry dominated by corporate giants.\n\u201cThe rules could give farmers and ranchers new leverage in suing meat companies that they believe have treated them unfairly. They would end practices among cattle and hog buyers that may lower prices paid to farmers and feedlot owners. And they would set new protections for poultry farmers, who often must go deeply into debt to build the chicken houses needed to win contracts from processors.\nThe Times article noted that, \u201cThe regulatory move comes as the Agriculture and Justice Departments have been holding a series of public workshops to discuss allegations of anticompetitive behavior in agriculture.\nFriday\u2019s article added that, \u201cGroups representing the meat industry criticized the proposed rules.\nThe AP reported on Friday that, \u201cPerhaps the most significant provision in the new rules is one that makes it easier for farmers to file suits under the Packers and Stockyards Act, said Peter Carstensen, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin who has studied agriculture competition law for decades.\n\u201cFarmers who now sue under the act must show a company has not only harmed them but that it has hurt competition in the overall meat industry, Carstensen said.\nBob Keefe reported on Friday at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that, \u201cThe rules could have a significant impact on farmers in Georgia \u2014 the nation\u2019s biggest poultry producer \u2014 and potentially affect how much consumers pay for chicken in the future.\nThe AJC article noted too that, \u201cThe proposed rule changes also raised a red flag at the Senate Agriculture Committee, where Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia is the ranking member.\nReuters news reported on Friday that, \u201cSmall-farm groups applauded the proposed rule. \u2018As long as the companies can arbitrarily cut off deliveries of birds to contract growers or cancel growers\u2019 contracts at any time, we will always be at the mercy of the companies\u2019 whims,\u2019 said Mike Weaver, president of the Contract Poultry Growers Association of the Virginias.\nIn other livestock related Farm Bill issues, Lyndsey Layton reported in yesterday\u2019s Washington Post that, \u201cUnder the Obama administration and the 2008 farm bill passed by Congress, the USDA is shifting attention to small and mid-size farms, encouraging organic and sustainable agriculture, and investing in projects to bring locally grown meat and produce to consumers.\n\u201cThe agency is promoting small meat producers in part by funding and approving more mobile slaughter units, staffing each one with a federal inspector, educating farmers and USDA employees about the units, and setting clear guidelines for farmers who want to build one. In December, the department set up a toll-free help line dedicated to small producers.\nAlexandra Zavis reported on Saturday at the Los Angeles Times Online that, \u201cWith concern growing in Sacramento about the millions of Californians struggling to get sufficient nutrition, advocates for the poor had hoped for progress this year on recommendations to improve access to federal food stamps.\nTom Zeller Jr. reported on Friday at The New York Times Online that, \u201c[P]ower generated by burning wood, plants and other organic material, which makes up 50 percent of all renewable energy produced in the United States, according to federal statistics, is facing increased scrutiny and opposition.\n\u201cThat, critics say, is because it is not as climate-friendly as once thought, and the pollution it causes in the short run may outweigh its long-term benefits.\nMr. Zeller noted that, \u201cBiomass proponents say it is a simple and proved renewable technology based on natural cycles. They acknowledge that burning wood and other organic matter releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere just as coal does, but point out that trees and plants also absorb the gas. If done carefully, and without overharvesting, they say, the damage to the climate can be offset.\n\u201cBut opponents say achieving that sort of balance is almost impossible, and carbon-absorbing forests will ultimately be destroyed to feed a voracious biomass industry fueled inappropriately by clean-energy subsidies. They also argue that, like any incinerating operation, biomass plants generate all sorts of other pollution, including particulate matter. State and federal regulators are now puzzling over these arguments.\nErik Eckolm reported on Friday at The New York Times Online that, \u201cThe Obama administration has opened a broad campaign of enforcement against farmers who employ children and underpay workers, hiring hundreds of investigators and raising fines for labor and wage violators.\n\u201cBut to make deep inroads, Congress would first have to change the law. A proposal to ban the hiring of 12- and 13-year-olds, cap working hours by 14- and 15-year-olds and keep teenagers out of hazardous jobs is gaining support in Congress. Some 91 representatives have co-sponsored the Care Act, put forth by Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of California.\nAnd Robert Rodriguez reported on Saturday at the Fresno Bee Online that, \u201cOvertime pay after eight hours is the law for wage earners across California \u2014 except for those who do some of the hardest work, harvesting fruit and vegetables in the state\u2019s fields and orchards.\n\u201cNow Sen. Dean Florez, D-Shafter, is trying to change that.\nJonathan Weisman reported on Friday at the Washington Wire Blog (The Wall Street Journal) that, \u201cPresident Barack Obama\u2019s meeting next Wednesday with senators to get energy legislation back on track will likely include discussing a climate change component that caps carbon emissions only from electric utilities, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said today in an interview.\nMr. Weisman added that, \u201cSen. Lamar Alexander (R, Tenn.), who has expressed some support for controlling utility carbon emissions, coupled with expanded nuclear power, is also expected to attend, along with Sens. Kerry, Lieberman, Jeff Bingaman (D, N.M.) and Richard Lugar (R, Ind.).\n\u201c\u2018The president\u2019s view is for inviting a wide range of people who have ideas.\u2019 Emanuel said.\nBen Geman reported yesterday at The Hill\u2019s Energy Blog that, \u201cSen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) said Sunday that he sees 20 swing votes in play for including greenhouse gas limits in energy legislation that the White House and Senate Democratic leaders hope to advance this summer.\n\u201cLieberman, appearing on CNN\u2019s \u2018State of the Union,\u2019 [transcript] said there are 50 senators that want to put a price on emitting carbon, 30 against it and 20 members who are undecided.\n\u201cMurkowski instead touted bipartisan energy legislation that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved a year ago. It contains a suite of provisions to boost energy efficiency and alternative energy development but lacks carbon provisions,\u201d The Hill update said.\nThe New York Times editorial board noted in today\u2019s paper that, \u201cTo anyone watching the oil spew into the Gulf of Mexico, the argument for curbing this country\u2019s appetite for fossil fuels could not be clearer. President Obama was right last week when he called on America to unify behind a \u2018national mission\u2019 to find alternative energy sources, sharply reduce its dependence on oil and cut its greenhouse gas emissions.\nScott Kilman repoted in today\u2019s Wall Street Journal that, \u201cTwo years after the global food crisis peaked, grain shortages are turning into surpluses that could create their own problems.\n\u201cSome traders and economists are speculating that if the U.S. and world economies don\u2019t heat up soon, surpluses could turn into price-depressing gluts. While cheap grain is good news for consumers and livestock producers, excessive supplies increase a government\u2019s cost for farm subsidies and tend to ignite trade fights between the big farming powers.\nThe Journal article stated that, \u201cWith world grain production this year expected to exceed demand for a third consecutive year, many grain traders and farm economists are beginning to debate the prospects for two starkly different outlooks.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T12:50:10Z", "url": "http://farmpolicy.com/2010/06/21/farm-bill-issues-ag-labor-issues-climate-developments-and-ag-economy/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

B 81, 165104 (2010)] fermionic Projected Entangled-Pair States (PEPS) were used to approximate the ground state of free and interacting spinless fermion models, as well as the $t$-$J$ model. This paper revisits these three models in the presence of an additional next-nearest hopping amplitude in the Hamiltonian. First we explain how to account for next-nearest neighbor Hamiltonian terms in the context of fermionic PEPS algorithms based on simulating time evolution. Then we present benchmark calculations for the three models of fermions, and compare our results against analytical, mean-field, and variational Monte Carlo results, respectively. Consistent with previous computations restricted to nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians, we systematically obtain more accurate (or better converged) results for gapped phases than for gapless ones.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T13:15:11Z", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3937", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The first South African surrogate babies - triplets at that - were born on 1 October 1987. The surrogate in this case was the 48-year-old mother of a young woman, who was unable to carry a child to term after removal of her uterus. The future of surrogate motherhood is still uncertain in most countries as very few legislatures have addressed the issue directly. Legal precedents are limited and common law principles do not provide adequate answers to the problems surrounding surrogate motherhood. For the purpose of this article, the de jure situation of surrogate motherhood in the United States of America, Britain and Australia will be examined as either their legislatures, or their courts, or both, have been active in this field.\nThe draft convention on the hotelkeeper&apos;s contract: an exercise in the unification of private law?\nIn spite of the fact that the Draft Convention on the Hotelkeeper&apos;s Contract is only a draft which has not yet been adopted by an international diplomatic conference, the period 1986-1988 has been earmarked for its adoption. After that, it will only be a matter of time before the Final Convention is adopted. South Africa will then have to decide whether or not to adopt the Convention as part of its law. In order to take the correct decision, the contents of the Draft ought by then to have been studied in order to determine whether they are compatible with South African law on this point and, if there are any deviations, whether these are fatal from a South African legal perspective. This modus operandi is consistent with state practice. States evaluate treaties and other international instruments by comparing them to related aspects in their own national systems. If this study in compatibility proves to be in their interest, they will accept these treaties as law either with some clearly indicated reservations or unreservedly. This article is a study on the compatibility between the Draft Convention and the South African law on this point.\nThe role of legal education in a changed South African society is going to be both important and multifaceted. The ingenuity of legal educators (and that of the legal profession as a whole) will be required to devise the fundamental restructuring of administrative units that change will entail. The burden shall be to actively challenge the notion that legal education is, or should be, aimed at producing persons destined solely for legal practice. The consequent increase in the demand for a legal education will place a great strain on the resources available to legal educators. The traditional mode of providing a legal education, may need re-examination, with perhaps a greater emphasis on distance teaching of law. Even in relation to our role as trainers of students destined for legal practice, we shall need to devise new approaches to legal education that will result in the production of well-rounded educated persons. Whatever the outcome, the experience of Papua New Guinea suggests that the resultant law reforming activity needs to be sustained.\nThe purpose of this article is to elucidate the meaning of the concept of \"permanent sovereignty over wealth and natural resources\" as formulated by the UN General Assembly resolutions. From the point of view of public international law, it is of interest to ascertain the legal status and effect of this concept. An attempt will be made to answer the question whether the concept of \"permanent sovereignty over wealth and natural resources\" means anything more than a reference to the sovereign state&apos;s right of nationalisation or expropriation of foreign property rights located within its territorial jurisdiction.\nToday, the area of drugs and drug product liability is a complex, ever changing synthesis of medicine and the law. Drugs are now recognised as inherently dangerous with potential for causing harm. The majority of today&apos;s prescription drugs hardly existed twenty years ago. In this age of chemotherapy, masses of the population are vaccinated or innoculated against diseases, and few, if any, individuals, do not at some time or another make use of medical prescriptions. It is then only to be expected that courts will at one time or another be flooded with cases of alleged injuries suffered from the use of such drugs. Such an avalanche of litigation did occur in the United States of America, but did not materialise in Commonwealth jurisdictions.There appears to be no legal obligation on medical practitioners to report any adverse drug reactions, and the data on reported incidents must be considered incomplete. A number of reasons may be advanced for this lack of reporting.\nOf the legal systems of the former three High Commission Territories in Southern Africa, that of Lesotho lies in between that of Swaziland with its strict dualism and that of Botswana which, though still dualist, shows overt signs of developing into a unified system. Of the three countries, Lesotho has by far the most involved set of internal conflict rules which, unlike the position in Botswana and Swaziland, have, for the most part, been formulated by the superior courts. On the other hand, of the three countries Lesotho has progressed farthest in the direction of a unified court structure. This is of the greatest importance as history elsewhere has shown that a unified judiciary leads towards unification of law. However, unification is not something which should, or indeed could, be forced upon the public. It is a long-term endeavour which depends for its successful outcome upon a carefully planned law reform programme which seeks community participation and support.\nHow customary is African customary law?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T12:35:29Z", "url": "https://journals.co.za/content/cilsa/20/3", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Glossopharyngeal breathing (GPB) is a technique useful in patients with a reduced vital capacity owing to respiratory muscle paralysis, for example following poliomyelitis or in tetraplegic. It is a trick movement that was first described by Dail (1951) when patients with poliomyelitis were observed to be gulping air into their lungs. It was this gulping action that gave the technique the name 'frog breathing'.\nGlossopharyngeal breathing is a form of positive pressure ventilation produced by the patient's voluntary muscles where boluses of air are forced into the lungs. Paralyzed patients dependent on a mechanical ventilator may be able to use GPB continuously, other than during sleep, to substitute the mechanical ventilation. The most common use of GPB is in patients who are able to breathe spontaneously but whose power to cough and clear secretions is inadequate. The technique may enable these patients to shout to attract attention and it may help to maintain or improve lung and chest wall compliance (Dail et al 1955).\nTo breathe in, a series of pumping strokes is produced by action of the lips, tongue, soft palate, pharynx and larynx. Air is held in the chest by the larynx which acts as a valve as the mouth is opened for the next gulp. Before starting to teach a patient glossopharyngeal breathing it is helpful for him to inflate his chest using an intermittent positive pressure ventilator with a mouthpiece. He can practice holding the breath while removing the mouthpiece and avoiding escape of air through the larynx or nose. The most important step in learning GPB is the up and down movement of the cricoid cartilage while keeping the jaw still. The patient can practice by watching the movement in a mirror and feeling the cartilage with his fingers.\nThis sequence should be practised slowly at first and then gradually speeded up until the movement flows. A leak of air may occur through the nose and, until it is prevented by the soft palate, a nose dip may be required.\nThe next stage is to take a maximum breath in and, while holding this breath, to add several glossopharyngeal gulps, to augment the vital capacity. When correct, the patient will feel his chest filling with air, and the physiotherapist can test the 'GPB vital capacity' by putting a mouthpiece attached to the expiratory limb of a Wright's respirometer in the patient's mouth before he exhales.\nThe respirometer can be used to measure the volume per gulp; the patient will require less effort and reach his maximum capacity more quickly if he develops a bigger volume per gulp. A study by Kelleher & Parida (1957) reported a group of patients in whom the average volume per gulp varied from 25-120 ml, and when teaching GPB an attempt should be made to achieve at least 60 ml per gulp. When used for clearance of secretions, 10-20 gulps may be required to obtain a maximal vital capacity, but if GPB is being used continuously as a substitute for normal tidal breathing approximately 6-8 gulps may be taken before breathing out.\nGlossopharyngeal breathing would normally be taught with the patient in a comfortable sitting position, but when mastered should be practiced in positions useful for the patient to clear his bronchial secretions. After filling his chest to capacity he signals to the physiotherapist who compresses his chest as he lets the air out The patient may have sufficient muscle power to apply compression himself or carers can be taught to give assistance.\nGPB is learnt easily by some patients, but others need time and patience to acquire this skill and must be motivated to practise frequently during the learning period. It is a valuable technique to consider when treating tetraplegic or poliomyelitis patients with a vital capacity of less man 2 litres. Instruction can begin when the patient has reached a stable condition, but it is inappropriate in the acute phase or during an acute chest infection. When successfully learnt it is invaluable during a period of chest infection to assist in the clearance of secretions. For a patient with a chest infection nursed in a 'tank' ventilator ('iron lung'), assisted coughing (Higgens 1966) may be more effective if the patient uses GPB to augment the inspiratory volume received from the ventilator before chest compression is applied.\nIt is possible to teach Glossopharyngeal breathing to patients with an uncuffed tracheostomy tube, provided there is an effective seal round the tube to avoid air leaks.\nGlossopharyngeal breathing should not be attempted in patients with neuromuscular disorders affecting swallowing, and, in patients with a progressive disorder, intermittent positive pressure breathing ( I P P B ) may be more appropriate than GPB. The technique is contraindicated in patients with airflow obstruction or pulmonary disease.\nFran\u00e7ois Maltais \"Glossopharyngeal-Breathing\", American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Vol. 184, No. 3 (2011), pp. 381.\nAssociation of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care.

{"text": "Happy Halloween: Smiley\u2019s Dog Costumes!\nOur first event came up unexpectedly, the Bridge and Tunnel Brewery was just a five minute walk from our apartment but we had no costume! I quickly cut out an avocado out of Dollar Tree cardboard paper and it was a success! Smiley won some toys and we got a growler for our fun last-minute costume.\nYou may have noticed the dog pictures on my Instagram, or read the two posts I wrote about our rescue Smiley \u2013 you may have even read the viral Dodo article about his rescue story! Our unexpected adoption (it only took two weeks of fostering to realize that Smiley belonged with us forever) changed all our plans. All those crazy Halloween parties we wanted to go to turned into us going to dog-friendly pub events, the dog parade and tonight we\u2019ll be going to the big NYC Halloween Parade with Smiley in tow.\nWe ended up going to another last minute event, the Tompkins Square dog parade, so Smiley wore his same avocadog costume and got outshined by popes and other crazy intricate creative costumes! It was a lot of fun and we\u2019re definitely going again next year with a better costume. Although most dogs wore hot dogs, delivery costumes and they rocked them, as a crafter I got inspired to do something a little more creative!\nTonight, the parade is mainly for people but Smiley will hopefully steal the show \u2013 as long as he actually wears the costume I made him and it doesn\u2019t fall apart. Stay tuned for photos of tonights shenanigans.\nAuthor olenakaguiPosted on October 31, 2018 Categories Animals and Pets, New YorkTags Avocadog, Halloween, Halloween parade, Halloween party, New York, Smiley, TompkinsLeave a comment on Happy Halloween: Smiley\u2019s Dog Costumes!\nTwo days ago we sent a $300 adoption fee to Pound Hounds Res-Q, the place that pulled Smiley from Brooklyn\u2019s high kill shelter, NYACC. We had originally planned on fostering Smiley, the cute 6 year old pit mix who was abandoned because his former owners got pregnant. We were in no position to get a dog \u2013 we don\u2019t make enough money and live in a small apartment, but we couldn\u2019t let Smiley die.\nWe ended up adopting Smiley after just two weeks of fostering, mostly because we fell in love with our foster boy and also because of Pound Hounds Res-Q. In addition to the fee, we also gave a small donation because of everything the rescue has done for us. Donating to rescues helps them save more dogs so I encourage everyone to do the same!\nThe amazing thing about fostering, is that it\u2019s practically free and saves lives! Shelters such as the NYACC become overcrowded and put animals on the kill list very quickly. They barely get a chance to get adopted! If you foster a dog, a rescue will cover the vet bills and any necessary training. Then you help the dog get decompressed, preferably crate trained and then you help them find a new forever home.\nFostering is a great way to help animals without making a lifetime commitment, that many people can\u2019t do. If we hadn\u2019t ended up adopting Smiley, we would have likely kept fostering, because it has been so rewarding. Let me tell you a bit about it!\nSmiley went from the NYACC to the vet to get neutered, then a special service was hired to bring him to us. We had never met him or even see him in real life! Smiley was friendly and curious but he wouldn\u2019t look up at me or make eye contact. He also didn\u2019t respond to commands, although we were told that he knew to sit, stay and come.\nWhen I brought him inside, he explored the place, sniffing every corner and demanding to know what was behind every door. It took over an hour to get him to slow down and rest on his doggy bed. He lay there for a while until I tried to put his harness on for a walk. He wouldn\u2019t let me put it on I\u2019m and bared his teeth, so I backed off and let him sleep. A few hours later, after my husband came home, he let us put the harness on without any fuss.\nOn his first walk with us, he pulled like crazy, giving us rope burn. He was so strong and wouldn\u2019t listen at all outside. We immediately ordered a front pulling harness, but got dragged around painfully for three whole days. We also watched some videos on how to get a dogs attention on walks and we tried to implement them, which only half worked.\nThe first evening while we watched TV, we saw him watching us from his bed. It was the first time he looked at us. Not surprising after being handed off from one person to another for ten days. He was scared and confused.\nWe crated him that first night as instructed by the rescue. People want to adopt crate trained dogs and we had to try our best although we didn\u2019t like the idea of him being in a small cage. He barked a bit but quickly went to sleep. The next morning he woke up wagging his tail at us, it was progress!\nThe second day he acted like a spoiled child, pushing his boundaries. He would jump on the sofa, demand treats and he pulled me even harder outside. I may have had one or two breakdowns that day because I couldn\u2019t connect with him. I couldn\u2019t see anyone adopting a dog that was this crazy and I also didn\u2019t know how long I could spend with him, but I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him like humans have in the past.\nThat night he barked more in his crate at night, and I was stressed knowing that we would have to leave him alone for up to six hours the next day. Everyone reassured me that he would be okay, as long as he wore a cone \u2013 he was recently neutered and could rip his stitches.\nWhen we came home after our trip, that we couldn\u2019t cancel although we had wanted to, we found his cone out of shape and he was practically hanging by it because a piece got stuck in his crate. It was around his neck so tight that he coughed when I cut it off. He seemed fine otherwise and extra friendly, but I was traumatized by the experience. I was too scared of putting him back in the crate while he had his cone, so we let him sleep in our bedroom on his bed.\nWhen he woke up that Sunday (we had gotten him in the afternoon on Thursday) he was a completely different dog. He was so calm at home, looked at us, asked us for pats and actually listened when we gave him commands. That day we took him to a beer festival because we didn\u2019t want to leave him home alone.\nWe had been told that he shouldn\u2019t be around other dogs or kids so we were extra careful. But he was calm around kids, accepting treats gently and he wagged his tail when he saw other dogs. We let him sniff a few and it seemed fine, we were starting to doubt everything that the kill shelter had said about him. We found a quiet spot at the chaotic festival and he sat with us, observing. People came over to meet him and he was so friendly and loving to everyone. No one believed that we had just rescued him.\nThe next day we had received a front clipping harness and the moment we put it on him, he stopped pulling on walks. He still got distracted outside but he was so much better at walking calmly. We let him sniff more dogs and discovered that he was super friendly but couldn\u2019t tell between dogs that wanted to play or fight.\nThe following week he started to feel at home. We let him sit with us on the couch but still kept him out of bed. He behaved better every day. Except the one time he jumped on the bed when I screamed because I saw a spider \u2013 but that\u2019s because I screamed and I assume that he was trying to protect me.\nDuring the week we also let him play with some dogs while leashed. He seemed to get along with everyone, ignoring the dogs who were aggressive and he backed away when an angry cat jumped out at him. He was clearly a good gentle boy!\nThat second weekend we had him, we took him to an amazing day care Petbuddy Services for a trial day. We were nervous to see how he would get a long with other dogs but it went really well! After a day of playing with dogs, he was even calmer on walks and less jumpy when he met new dogs.\nThe day he spent at doggy daycare we went out, but came home before picking Smiley up. Our home felt so empty without him even though he had only been there for ten days! That\u2019s when we decided that we\u2019d be keeping him. But we wanted to wait in case there were any issues with our landlord, although those were unlikely.\nOn Wednesday we took him to the vet again, and even though the rescue knew we were 99% likely to adopt him, Pound Hounds Res-Q paid his bill. Later that evening, we officially paid his adoption fee and he became a part of our family. The next day, I let him play off leash with a bunch of friendly dogs at the park and he did so well, people didn\u2019t believe me that he was a new rescue.\nSince getting Smiley there has been more stress in my life \u2013 we need to figure out where he will be while we\u2019re on holiday. We need to worry about him getting sick, hurting himself or feeling lonely when he\u2019s alone at home. I also have a companion at home now, a smiling face that makes me happier and I can\u2019t walk him down the street without him getting compliments left and right. Oh, he also gets me out of the house more and breathing that fresh New York air! I\u2019ve even met a few local dog owners that are quickly becoming friends.\nOf course I\u2019m already worrying about Smiley dying one day, but that\u2019s just how my brain works. He has already made my life so much better and more worthwhile. As much as I think that everyone should adopt a dog, or five, immediately, I understand that not everyone is int he position to do so.\nFoster! If you can\u2019t adopt. Donate to rescues, if you want to help but can\u2019t foster. Dogs, and animals in general, bring so much happiness and unconditional love to our hectic lives. They deserve our help and love, they should all feel safe and happy \u2013 the same way they make us feel. Please consider donating to Pound Hounds Res-Q today, without them we wouldn\u2019t have this beautiful dog as a part of our family!\nWe\u2019ve been to Tonsai twice now \u2013 once in December and the second time in July. December was hot, dry, lively and exciting! In July it was dead, everything was closed, the weather was miserable! Tonsai is a great place that\u2019s still pretty empty compared to Phi Phi Island and even neighboring beaches.\nWhile it\u2019s the perfect getaway during high (and dry) season, it\u2019s really not enjoyable during the low (monsoon) season. Unless you enjoy being one of 10 tourists on a hard to get to spot with only two available restaurants that mainly serve fried food. If you come any other time, you can enjoy a long tail boat ride to the beach, a choice of many restaurants, food vendors and bars, there are lots of people hanging out on the beach or at the hostels but there are also thieving mischievous monkeys!\nWe\u2019re Fostering a Dog Saved from the Kill Shelter!\nSmiley was pulled from the NYACC by Pound Hounds Res-Q. We are considering adopting him ourselves because he\u2019s such a good boy. The Dodo wrote about him a week ago with the hopes that his story will inspire others to adopt, foster and rescue dogs in need!\nAuthor olenakaguiPosted on October 23, 2018 October 22, 2018 Categories Animals and Pets, New YorkTags dog saved, foster, fostering, kill shelter, Pound Hounds, Pound Hounds Resq, rescue, rescue dog, SmileyLeave a comment on We\u2019re Fostering a Dog Saved from the Kill Shelter!\nThe second time we visited Thailand was the middle of July, which is right when monsoon season is wreaking havoc on the island and keeping all those selfie-taking tourists away \u2013 but clearly not all of them.\nThe first time we visited Thailand was during the dry winter months when it\u2019s hot, overpopulated with tourists and low tied can ruin boat rides, kayaking and other water adventures. The second time we came in the middle of July, which is right when monsoon season is wreaking havoc on the island and keeping all those selfie-taking tourists away \u2013 but clearly not all of them.\nA week before we arrived the famous case of football camp boys who were stuck in a flooded cave and a ferry had sunk, drowning many on board. We didn\u2019t know about this when we booked and it was quite scary to be there. We got lucky and the weather ended up clearing up, but all ferry and boat rides were rough, scary and puke-inducing.\nPuffballs of all sizes grow in the forest, alongside roads, in the middle of a green grassy lawn, they can really grow anywhere! You can stir fry them, cook them in the oven and my absolute favorite, is pretending they are pancakes!\nIt\u2019s prime mushroom picking season but it\u2019s quickly cooling down. You might be seeing mushrooms all around you, even in city parks and on the side of highways! There\u2019s still some time to go out and forage before winter chases us indoors for Netflix, hot chocolate and hibernation. However, most mushrooms take a lot of experience to identify which can be scary and discouraging.\nIt is also extremely dangerous to eat anything that you\u2019re not certain about. Although there are many YouTube videos and Facebook groups are not always a reliable way to be sure that you will be safe. Even after you read this article, go talk to experienced mushroom pickers, join a mycological society and always be overly careful.\nIt is not legal to pick mushrooms everywhere. Ask a police officer, park ranger or at the info center where you can pick them. If you go anywhere else, you risk getting a hefty fine. In NYC it can be up to $250!\nWild mushrooms are not like the ones you buy at the store. Some people might experience an allergy to a specific type even though they are not allergic to others. Some edible mushrooms have skins that certain people might react to with a stomach ache. Although I am lucky to be allergy free and tolerate everything I\u2019ve tried so far, I\u2019m aware that I might eat a perfectly good edible mushroom that might make me feel sick.\nLet\u2019s get down to business, there are mushrooms that are growing everywhere around New York right now and they happen to taste delicious! The giant puffball (tiny ones are good too) is really easy to identify, grows to be huge so it\u2019s satisfying to find and it\u2019s a great way to begin your mushroom picking lifestyle.\nPuffballs come in round shapes and in various sizes. They don\u2019t have any gills, or stems, they grow right out of the ground. The regular kind is small, round, white/grayish/yellowish with tiny bumps and they get dark and dry when they are ready to release their spores. When they are dry, you can stomp on them and they will puff out dark-colored spores, which is why they are called puffballs.\nGiant puffballs don\u2019t taste any better than small ones, arguably they taste worse. But one big puffball can feed a family of three for a day. They can grow to be larger than your head! In their prime they are pure white on the outside and inside.\nIf they are any there color, or have any markings, be cautious.\nUnlike the hen-of-the-woods that I wrote about earlier this week, giant puffballs do have a very poisonous lookalike, but it\u2019s extremely easy to differentiate them! Once you pick a puffball, cut it down the middle from top to bottom, an edible puffball will have firm purely white firm flesh without any markings. It should look like sliced mozzarella!\nIf the mushroom is off-white, it\u2019s an edible kind that\u2019s past it\u2019s prime. Don\u2019t eat it! There are several stages of a puffball going bad. First, the inside will get yellower but will remain firm. Then it\u2019ll get wetter and darker, at this point the outside might be getting yellower too. Finally, it dries up and releases dark gray/black spores.\nEven when a puffball is yellow, it\u2019s technically not poisonous. The only type of puffball that is poisonous, is one with black lines that look like intricate designs. These will be on the outside and on the inside. These puffballs are very poisonous and should NOT be consumed.\nPuffballs of all sizes grow in the forest, alongside roads, in the middle of a green grassy lawn, they can really grow anywhere! Just make sure to cut every single mushroom in half, and throw any puffball that isn\u2019t pure white on the inside. The rule of thumb with mushrooms is, if there is any doubts, leave it behind.\nIf you thought that the hen-of-the-woods had many recipes, just wait until you bring home a haul of puffballs. You can stir fry them, cook them in the oven and my absolute favorite, is pretending they are pancakes!\nAll you need to do is cut 3/4 inch slices, fry them in the oven or on the pan with some coconut oil and cinnamon and serve with maple syrup. If you cook them long enough you can barely taste the difference \u2013 they are soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Delicious. Here are some other recipes.\nJust a quick reminder, some people don\u2019t react well to the skin of puffball mushrooms (or any mushroom skins). Some mushrooms have tough skin that\u2019s supposed to protect the mushroom from being eaten, this skin can be hard to digest and some people are more sensitive than others.\nIt\u2019s very similar to the skin on certain nuts, if you\u2019ve ever pooped out an intact almond, you know what I\u2019m talking about. Personally, I eat the skin but please be aware that you might have a reaction to it! You can always start by eating a small piece with the skin on, wait a few hours and see how you feel. It can be scary to feel sick after eating a wild mushroom and not know why.\nDo you have any stories to share about puffballs? What\u2019s your record find (size or amount)? What\u2019s your favorite recipe? Share your puffball stories with us in the comments below!\nI find these mushrooms the most rewarding to pick, because even a small one is enough as a side dish to any meal and the bigger ones can feed an entire family! Every time I\u2019ve looked for hens, I found at least one and usually had 2-4 kilos (4-9 pounds) in just 30 minutes of searching. Of course, you can also find a single mushroom that weighs 13+ kilos (30+ pounds).\nLet\u2019s get down to business, there are mushrooms that are growing everywhere around New York right now and they happen to taste delicious! The hen-of-the-woods (maitake) doesn\u2019t have any poisonous look alikes, grows to be huge so it\u2019s satisfying to find and it\u2019s a great way to begin your mushroom picking lifestyle.\nThe hen-of-the-woods looks a little like the fluffy feathers of a hen, hence it\u2019s name. Here are some photos of how they can look at different stages of growth.\nDon\u2019t confuse the hen-of-the-woods with the chicken-of-the-woods. Chickens can grow higher up on the tree, they are orange and they grow in layers. I have heard a lot about these mushrooms and I\u2019m told they\u2019re delicious, however I haven\u2019t found any yet and I don\u2019t know how to tell them apart from the many other orange mushrooms that grow on trees! Stick with hens at the beginning, you can\u2019t go wrong with them and there are plenty to go around!\nHen-of-the-woods mushrooms typically grow on oak trees, so if you see acorns on the ground you\u2019re in the right spot. If you look at the roots of an oak, you\u2019ll notice that they have a clumpy shape with many little lumps which is very similar to the hen mushroom. From a distance, you might confuse a hen mushroom with some dried leaves. Always go check it out, and take a look around the entire tree. They tend to grow on bigger, wider oaks and there can be a several clusters of them around a single tree!\nHen-of-the-woods are either off-white, kind of beige/grayish or more brownish, especially around it\u2019s rounded edges. They always grow in clumps, so from a distance you could confuse them with clustered mushrooms \u2013 remember that even though it looks like a cluster, it\u2019s one big mushroom that spreads out and looks fluffy. If you cut it at the stem and you see many individual mushrooms, it\u2019s not a hen. If you see any gills (pictured below) it is NOT a hen.\nHens are smooth, fluffy looking, single-stemmed mushrooms.\nRemember, the picture above is NOT a hen-of-the-woods. It\u2019s an example of gills, that hens do NOT have.\nSometimes, the hen-of-the-woods grows on trees other than oaks. If you want to be extra safe, you can stick to only eating the ones that you find on oak trees, although like I already said, there isn\u2019t any dangerous look-a-like. Hens are very unique looking.\nDon\u2019t forget to bring some common sense with you to the forest. If there are too many bugs on the hen, if it looks dry or off-color, then it\u2019s probably not good for eating. While most insects are pretty safe to eat if cooked correctly, you should stay away from unintentional entomophagy. Plus, insects can cause allergic reactions in people who are also allergic to shellfish.\nAnother common sense move is to avoid picking mushrooms in forests where there\u2019s a mark on the tree, or a colorful rope tied around an area. These could mark a protected area, a sick tree, some sort of pest, pollution, disease, etc. If it looks questionable, don\u2019t go there.\nSame goes for roadside mushrooms. Think about the pollution that they are exposed to. Would you like some car exhaust with your mushrooms? I don\u2019t think so. Don\u2019t pick anything that looks unclean (not including natural forest dirt) or could be polluted. Similarly to road exhaust, some places could be using pesticides or other chemicals in the area. Although most of us are already exposed to them from the food we buy in supermarkets, the less chemicals we consume, the better.\nWhen you find a hen and bring it home, watch a video on how to clean it correctly. It has many layers, the thick white stem isn\u2019t as yummy as the rest of it so you want to cut that off and if possible, clean it outside or in a large tub to avoid clogging your drain with forest debris. If you see any holes, cut into them and remove any insects, spiders or slugs.\nHow do you cook a hen?\nThere are so many ways to cook these mushrooms! Chop them into tiny pieces and stir fry, with other veggies, or if you\u2019re not vegetarian then maybe some meat, lard or eggs to make the perfect mushroomy omelette.\nThe nutritional value of hens varies depending on the website, but everyone agrees that they have very little fat or protein and lots of vitamin D. Some websites claim that they have very few carbs, others claim that they are 70% carbs. Almost everyone agrees that they are a healthy addition to a balanced diet!\nI tend to use too much olive oil and caramelized onions to make a fatty, crispy, scrumptious meal but there are much healthier alternatives. You can cook them in the oven with coconut oil, you can steam them, boil them, grill them probably even air fry them. Whatever you chose to do, make sure to cook them well as they can be a bit chewy and hard on the stomach if you undercook hens, although this is true for mushrooms in general. You can find various recipes here.\nIf you didn\u2019t manage to find any, or didn\u2019t want to risk picking the wrong mushroom, you can still enjoy eating wild hen-of-the-woods. Check out your local farmers markets from August until November and I guarantee that you\u2019ll find some hens \u2013 generally for $1 per pound!\nDo you enjoy picking mushrooms?

{"text": "Why should you Laminate your Hardwood Floors?\nThe lamination is done by a synthetic product which is applied in various layers. it is designed to shine the outer surface of hardwood. Hardwood floors are like laminated floors but different. Because the two terms are used interchangeably, it is important to know the pros and cons of both types of flooring so that you can choose what works best with you. If you want you to want to convert your hardwood floors into laminate wood flooring, know the following facts about both types of floor.\nThe bare surface of the wood is prime a core layer of melamine resin. The resin is what provides the hardwood a waterproof coating and shine. The fiberboard material is then applied to make faux wood texture to regain the touch of the wood which has been shadowed by the use of resin.\nThe laminate hardwood flooring is apparently different from that of untreated hardwood. The shine isn\u2019t there in the raw wood, the texture is incredibly obvious and the wood grain is tremendously abundant whereas laminated floor offers a glass-like feel and finish. The untreated wood can never offer similarity; if you are fond of different textures and colors, you can go with the Harwood. When no tint or staining has been applied to the surface of the wood, the original color is what it all has, and since every plank is of different color and texture, the floors made with unprocessed wood are unique in designs.\nHowever, when you are required to lay a wooden floor to a defined area, you must know that it is essential to maintain uniformity so that the house is alike. You can\u2019t place wood of all colors and hues to the entire house, it is essential to have at least a few pieces of matching color to form a theme and design.\nThe processed wooden floors are treated with either a tint or stain because of which the color throughout the floor appears the same. Since a layer of melamine resin and aluminum oxide is added on the top of the wood, the laminated floors are harder. The resin doesn\u2019t only provide the shine it forms a strong surface above the wood, because of these coating the hardwood becomes more durable.\nThe wood becomes water resistant after a good coat of lamination. This fact that the moisture can\u2019t penetrate the material makes the floor stronger. You will not incur any moisture damage if the surface is layered with good lamination. Since the wood is a porous an alive substance, the water finds its way in through the pores residing in the substance. Wet or moist woods are prone to the damage a lot like rot and mold.\nThe laminated wood flooring is very hard to repair. Once the damage occurs the plank can be removed but even after a careful repair, the replaced planks will show out because of the difference in the application of the resin. When you are laminating a whole floor, you can get an even coat and smooth application of the product all along, but while laminating only a board, it is difficult to match the color with the rest of the floor. The amount of aluminum oxide applied on the surface is the factor which is responsible to reflect light and if it is not applied in an effective way, the color of the boards will appear different.\nHardwood is easy to maintain. You can clean the surface with a mop or a damp sponge, soap solutions and regular cleaners but with the finished or treated woods, you can\u2019t do that. Regular cleaners can damage the shine of the wood and may permanently eliminate the sparkle. The surface should be protected from the scratches because polished wood makes the notches visible a little more.\nAuthor Bio:Emily is a content writer who loves to produce creative and informative content for people of all nature. In addition, he is also interest in Laminate Wood flooring writings to provide tips and tricks in the form of good articles.\nPrevious Article How Social Media Can Help HR Achieve Organizational Goals?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T20:59:53Z", "url": "https://www.trionds.com/why-should-you-laminate-your-hardwood-floors/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Gingerbread and scones are two of those things that really get overlooked. I mean, I\u2019ll be the first person to admit that I\u2019ve never been a scone person. I know they make a great on-the-go breakfast for busy days, but I always thought they would taste a little bit dry and boring. Then, I made these Gingerbread Scones for a holiday-themed brunch and I was blown away. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong! These delightful breakfast pastries are light, soft, and tender. Not to mention that they\u2019re full of festive flavor, thanks to the molasses and gingerbread spices.\nYou can also feel pretty good about eating these tasty treats. We were able to make them without adding any processed sugar, but they taste sweet and satisfying just like your favorite coffee shop treats. Even with swapping in some healthy ingredients (like Greek yogurt, skim milk, and coconut sugar) these pastries bake up with a crisp exterior and a moist, tender crumb inside. And they\u2019re perfectly portion-sized, too. That\u2019s always a good thing for me around the holidays when I need to control my sweet-tooth cravings.\nLike I said, gingerbread often gets overlooked this time of year, thanks to the more-popular flavors of Pumpkin Spice Lattes and pecan pie. People still make gingerbread houses for Christmas, but I don\u2019t think a lot of people are baking up the flavors of gingerbread \u2013 which is a shame! It\u2019s time for us to change that by making these Gingerbread Scones for our friends and family. They\u2019ll be hooked after the first bite, just like me.\nOriginally, people made gingerbread as a way to preserve ginger during Medieval European times. To make the cakes sweeter and more edible, people started heavily flavoring the cakes with molasses. This dark, sticky substance gives a rich and slightly smoky flavor to the cake, along with a punch of nutrition. Blackstrap molasses is full of vitamins and minerals, too, like iron, vitamin B6, selenium, and magnesium. These days, it\u2019s also a popular sweetener for those with diabetes because it helps stabilize blood sugar!\nEventually, gingerbread cakes turned into cookies, muffins, pies, and more. They\u2019re most commonly found as crackers to build gingerbread houses during the holidays, but a recent surge in gingerbread-flavored products is making the spicy cake trendy again. We\u2019re pretty happy about that, especially after eating these Gingerbread Scones.\nAlmost all good scones are topped with a sugary glaze. It\u2019s usually sinfully sweet because it\u2019s little more than powdered sugar and milk. We wanted to capture the spirit of the glaze without putting anyone into a diabetic shock. Luckily, Greek yogurt makes a perfect substitute!\nBy the time you whip the tangy yogurt together with the maple syrup and vanilla extract, it will be completely transformed. No one will know it used to be yogurt. If you have a hard time finding plain Greek yogurt, feel free to swap-in one of the flavored varieties. Try to find neutral flavors that will go well with the Gingerbread Scone, though, like vanilla, honey, or coconut flavors.\nIn a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, coconut sugar, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves. Note: add 2 cups floor, then add a little at a time until it makes a cookie dough like consistency.\nGrate the butter on a box grater and mix it into the flour with your hands until the mixture resembles lumpy, wet sand.\nGently mix in the molasses, 1/2 cup of the yogurt, and milk. Once the mixture comes together, turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and gently knead it using your hands until a dough comes together.\nForm the dough into a large circle about 1-inch deep. Cut the circle into 8 equal slices.\nPlace the slices on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, until lightly browned on the outside. A toothpick inserted into the center of the scone should come out clean.\nMeanwhile, make the drizzle by whisking together the remaining tablespoon of Greek yogurt, maple syrup, and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag.\nAllow the scones to cool for 10 minutes before drizzling the glaze over the scones.\nWhether you\u2019re looking for healthy holiday recipes or something for everyday eating, we have a recipe for you!

{"text": "Amy is on the Delectable Education Podcast today talking all about her vast experience with starting Charlotte Mason communities. Amy and I met largely because of the book club she held in her living room full of women eager to learn more of Mason, her methods, and how to better implement them in our homes. She also began a co-op out of her home which grew and grew until it became, and still is, a school for children K-12. After moving, she has begun a new co-op and still sits on the board at the school she began, though the running of the day to day operations is now in the hands of another amazing mother and teacher of Charlotte\u2019s method. In addition to books clubs, co-ops, and a school, Amy has also begun a Nature Club or two, muti-day summer intensives for mothers, field trips, and so many other ways that have helped moms and their children thrive not only in their homes, but within a community of learning.\nIf you are a reader who is clicking over after listening to the podcast, we welcome you to our little corner of the internet. We are homeschooling mothers who have used the CM method for many years and in many different situations \u2013 at home, in school, overseas, and in multiple regions within the USA. To hear more of our stories, click here. We like to write about how using the CM method has changed our whole lives, and not just our homeschools, so while we certainly write about nature, and books, and habits, you\u2019ll also see us chatting about homemaking, mother culture, and organizing our days.\nIf you are a long time reader, we invite you to head over to hear Amy speaking today on the podcast! We\u2019d love to hear about communities you\u2019ve started or questions you have about starting communities in the comments or via email.\nWelcome to the first room in our series, the Kitchen. Let\u2019s start here, as this is both the heart of the home and where much work of the mother occurs. Before we dive into cleaning, simplifying, and making our kitchen beautiful, it would make sense to think about what we need our kitchens to be. If we think of our rooms as servants to the people who use them, how can your kitchen better serve your family?\nThink through the annoying spots. That counter that is just NEVER clear, that drawer that doesn\u2019t even open all the way and you have no idea what is back there, the cabinet where all the storage containers are in a jumble or the pots are jammed in\u2026 You all know what your least favorite spots are. Write them down. If you use one, this would be a great page in your bullet journal. Write down all the things that make your kitchen inefficient or unpleasant right now. Some of these we can work on this month and it will be so nice to look at this list after the problems are solved!\nRelated to this is also the idea of where do your processes have a bottleneck? Is one part of the kitchen where people are bumping into one another as they cook while no one ever seems to be in another spot? Maybe some rearranging is in order. We\u2019ll discuss work zones later in the series, but it might be a good time to start thinking about yours and how you can arrange the things in your kitchen to accommodate the people who use them. In my home, I\u2019d like my kids to unload the dishwasher with less help from me, but that means it would be nice if all the bowls and glassware weren\u2019t on shelves they cannot reach. Perhaps moving the coffee maker and mugs away from the main cooking area to prevent morning traffic jams would help you, or creating a space where kids can help prep veggies without being too close to a hot oven is your need. Write down all your thoughts and possible solutions. Brainstorm here for a while because sometimes a very small change can have a big impact.\nWhen the cooking is through, is it easy to clean? Do you have a system for getting the dishes cleaned quickly after each meal and the counter cleared as well? Is the floor swept and the table wiped so that if a guest were to drop in, you could bring them gladly into your kitchen for a cup of tea or coffee? Do you have a schedule for cleaning out those things that are not everyday tasks \u2013 the oven, the microwave, the refrigerator? Cutting time off of your cleaning means you can use it elsewhere so we\u2019ll focus on this aspect of the kitchen too. Until then, write down a list of things that don\u2019t get done as often as you like, and another list of all the people in the home who are able to do those tasks. Caring for the home is a family affair, not yours alone.\nSwitching gears, what do you love about your kitchen? Maybe you appreciate the ample cabinet space, or you love an apron that was passed down from your grandmother. Big or small, make a list of things that are great about your space. Good light? Charming woodwork? A lovely piece of art hanging on the wall? We\u2019ll figure out a way to highlight these later and hopefully make the list even longer.\nLastly, I like to remember that when we make our space the best it can be, then it is up to us to improve our attitudes toward the space as well. I like to think of the fact that there are women who blog daily recipes and write cookbooks out of tiny kitchens. Ma Ingalls had no cabinets or refrigerator and she raised five children and cooked delicious meals. You need not live in or pine for some imaginary dream kitchen when the one you have now is where your life is being lived day by day. Amazing meals happen in awkward spaces and amazing memories are made in humble kitchens. Celebrate the space you have now, and let\u2019s make it as pleasant as possible.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T01:55:55Z", "url": "https://learninghowtolive.com/tag/homeschool/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Hongdae is named after the area around Hongik University and that tells me everything I need to know: this is college town central.\nMore alive at night than in the day, it\u2019s teeming with caf\u00e9s (look for Sangsu-dong Caf\u00e9 Street), and clubs (on which there are many on the so-named Club Street).\nPlenty of street art to be found here because Hongdae is the hub of all things indy and expressing one\u2019s individuality.\nIt seems strange at first, admittedly, the idea of eating ribs with cheese; but once I try it, I wonder why it took me so long. At popular James Cheese & Back Ribs, they take this idea and run with it to great success.\nWe have two orders of ribs and kimchi rice. The table is set up with a portable burner on which a cast-iron platter is placed. Even uncooked, it mesmerizes, the half-cooked ribs\u2019 sticky, ochre coating glistens and the shreds of mozzarella wait expectantly.\nThe restaurant is small but supremely hip as you can see in the photo\u2019s background. Our bleached blond server makes quick work of the mozzarella \u2013 mixing, lifting, and stretching it out until it\u2019s one stretchy, mouthwatering mass.\nThe scissors provided are helpful in ways that a knife never will be. We wrap strips of mozzarella around each rib, a mouthful makes for a most scintillating encounter; appetites stoked by the sight of soft meat, melting cheese. The corn and omelet side dishes are added curiosities that are equally delicious.\nMy Bin and I eat, enraptured.\nWhen there\u2019s nothing left of the meat, the server returns with a bowl of kimchi rice. Whatever is left of the cheese is mixed with it, and an egg is tossed in to further flavor and lubricate the fiery mess. Too good.\nGangnam is gargantuan and jam-packed. A frenetic energy pervades, and the city girl in me is giddy. It\u2019s remarkable how visiting a foreign city again cements its place in my heart.\nThe big buildings beckon, beacons of commerce and wealth. Somewhere in my head, I hear Psy singing the soundtrack to this \u201cOpa Gangnam style!\u201d lifestyle.\nGangnam nightlife. Ahhh, where shall we eat tonight?\nMy obligatory intersection shot showcasing a street pulsing with people.\nSometimes we feel the need to escape from the frenzy on the surface so we duck down below to the underground shopping center at Gangnam station. Oddly, it\u2019s as fevered and wild down here as it is up there. So we go with the flow, and what else: shop.\nOne of our new discoveries on this trip is Yoogane, a restaurant specializing in dak galbi. Essentially a stir-fried dish of diced chicken in a gochujang-based sauce, lots of fun ingredients are tossed in for variation and customization.\nA massive metal cover surrounds the hot plate to avoid splatters. In goes the scallions, onions, gochujang, and my beloved tteok (rice cakes).\nGarlic, rice, and seaweed join the stir-fry party.\nMix! (say three times, fast).\nAs my Bin and I learn from our meal at James Cheese & Back Ribs, there\u2019s very little that can\u2019t be improved with more mozzarella.\n\u2026 flips the mixture over: voila! Melted cheese rice! My Bin and I descend upon the dish, our greed feeding our hunger brought on by hours spent exploring Gangnam. Much a melding of soft (rice, tteok, cheese, minced chicken), there\u2019s a current of spice running throughout that satisfies and makes us want more\u2026 until there\u2019s nothing left except some crisp crumbs clinging to the pan.\nThey say that Hongdae is where all the student-artists hang out but Samcheongdong is where all the successful ones end up. The proliferation of art galleries attests to this but the area is so peaceful and genteel. I highly recommend coming here if you want a few hours of quiet exploration. There are boutiques and caf\u00e9s aplenty.\nNearby is the Bukchon Hanok Village where 900 hanok are situated. Traditional Korean homes with tiled roofs and varied wall patterns, passing through this area harks back to a more tranquil time. It\u2019s an unexpected pleasure to get lost here.\n\u2026before you walk down again.\nIn the midst of the hanok village is a place serving tea and for me, my favorite hot red bean porridge. As my Bin and I sip and savor, time seems to stand still. Our trip is coming to an end and we can\u2019t help but marvel at how we\u2019ve fallen in love with Seoul. Again.\nA final meal of bulgogi and assorted other Korean barbeques before we head off to the airport.\nFrom the Hongik University stop, leave the station from Exit 7 and turn right.

{"text": "The day is drawing near when the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church will celebrate the fourth centenary of the union between the Bishops of the Metropolia of Kievan Rus' and the Apostolic See. The union was effected at the meeting of representatives of the Metropolia of Kiev with the Pope on 23 December 1595 and was solemnly proclaimed at Brest-Litovsk on the River Bug on 16 October 1596. Pope Clement VIII, in the Apostolic Constitution Magnus Dominus et laudabilis nimis,1 announced the union to the whole Church and in the Apostolic Letter Benedictus sit Pastor2 he addressed the Bishops of the Metropolia, informing them that the union had taken place.\nThe Union of Brest opened a new page in the history of the Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine.4 Today that Church wishes to sing with joy a hymn of thanksgiving and praise to the One who, once more, has brought it back from death to life, and it wishes to set forth with renewed enthusiasm on the path marked out by the Second Vatican Council.\nJoining the faithful of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in this thanksgiving and petition are the Greek Catholic Churches of the diaspora which date back to the Union of Brest, together with the other Eastern Catholic Churches and the entire Church.\nAs the Bishop of Rome, I too wish to unite myself to the Catholics of the Byzantine tradition in those lands. For many years, during my pastoral ministry in Poland, I sensed a physical as well as a spiritual closeness with that Church, which was then undergoing such difficult trials. After my election to the See of Peter, I considered it a pressing duty, following the example of my Predecessors, to speak out in defence of its right to exist and freely to profess its faith, at a time when both these rights were being denied. I now have the privilege of joyfully sharing in its celebration of these days of regained freedom.\n2. The celebrations commemorating the Union of Brest must be seen in the context of the Millennium of the Baptism of the Rus'. Seven years ago, in 1988, that event was celebrated with great solemnity. For the occasion I published two documents: the Apostolic Letter Euntes in mundum of 25 January 1988,5 for the whole Church, and the Message Magnum Baptismi donum, of 14 February of the same year,6 addressed to Ukrainian Catholics. It was an occasion for celebrating a moment of fundamental importance for the Christian and cultural identity of those peoples, a moment of unique significance, since at that time the Churches of the Byzantine tradition and the Church of Rome were still living in full communion.\nAfter the division which damaged the unity between the West and the Byzantine East, frequent and intense efforts were made to restore full communion. I wish to mention two particularly significant events: the Second Council of Lyons in 1274, and above all the Council of Florence in 1439, when protocols of union with the Eastern Churches were signed. Unfortunately, various causes prevented the promise and potential of those agreements from being realized.\nThe Bishops of the Metropolia of Kiev, in restoring communion with Rome, made explicit reference to the decisions of the Council of Florence, a Council which had numbered among its participants representatives from the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\nIn this context, the figure of Metropolitan Isidore of Kiev stands out. As a faithful interpreter and defender of the decisions of that Council, he had to endure exile for his convictions.\nThe Bishops who promoted the union and the members of their Church retained a lively awareness of their original close ties to their Orthodox brethren, together with a full consciousness of the Oriental identity of their Metropolia, an identity which was also to be upheld after the union. In the history of the Catholic Church, it is a highly significant fact that this just desire was respected and that the act of union did not involve passing over to the Latin tradition, as some thought would happen. Their Church saw an acknowledgment of its right to be governed by its own hierarchy with a specific discipline and to maintain its Eastern liturgical and spiritual heritage.\n3. After the union, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church enjoyed a period in which its ecclesiastical structures flourished, with resulting benefits for religious life, the education of the clergy and the spiritual commitment of the faithful. With remarkable farsightedness, great importance was attached to education. Thanks to the valuable contribution of the Basilian Order and other Religious Congregations, there was a great growth in the study of the sacred sciences and the nation's culture. In the present century, a figure of extraordinary prestige, in this regard as well as in his witness of suffering borne for Christ, was Metropolitan Andrii Sheptyckyi, whose education and fine spiritual qualities were combined with outstanding organizational gifts. He founded schools and academies, supported theological studies and the human sciences, the press and sacred art, and sought to preserve historical memories.\nAnd yet, all this ecclesial vitality was continually marked by the tragedy of misunderstanding and opposition. An illustrious victim in this regard was the Archbishop of Polock and Vitebsk, Josaphat Kuntsevych, whose martyrdom merited the unfading crown of eternal glory. His body now lies in the Vatican Basilica, where it is continuously venerated with devotion and gratitude by Catholics from throughout the world.\nOutstanding among the heroic witnesses to the rights not only of the faith but also of human conscience in those difficult years is the figure of Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj: his courage in enduring exile and prison for 18 years and his indomitable confidence in the resurrection of his Church make him one of the most powerful figures among the confessors of the faith in our time. Nor should his many companions in punishment be forgotten, particularly Bishops Hryhory Khomyshyn and Josaphat Kocylowskyj.\nThese tempestuous events shook the Church in the homeland to its roots. But Divine Providence had already begun to make it possible for many of its members to find a way of escape for themselves and their people. From the beginning of the 19th century onwards, great waves of emigrants began to cross the ocean, settling above all in Canada, the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The Holy See took care to be close to them, by providing assistance and establishing pastoral structures for them in their new homes, including the establishment of their own Eparchies. At the time of trial, during the atheistic persecution in their native land, the voice of these believers could thus be raised, in full freedom, with strength and courage. In the international forum they defended the right of their persecuted brethren to religious freedom, and thus strengthened the Second Vatican Council's appeal for religious freedom,8 and the efforts made in this regard by the Holy See.\n4. The whole Catholic Community recalls with deep emotion the victims of such great suffering: the martyrs and confessors of the faith of the Church in Ukraine offer us a magnificent lesson in fidelity even at the price of life itself. And we, the favoured witnesses of their sacrifice, are aware that they helped to maintain the dignity of a world which seemed overwhelmed by atrocities. They knew the truth, and the truth set them free. Christians in Europe and throughout the world, pausing in prayer before the concentration camps and prisons, should be grateful for the light which they gave: it was the light of Christ, which they caused to shine in the darkness. For long years the darkness seemed in the eyes of the world to prevail, but it was not able to extinguish that light, which was the light of God and the light of man, wounded but not laid low.\nThis inheritance of suffering and glory today stands at a historic crossroads: now that the chains of imprisonment have been broken, the Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine has begun again to breathe in freedom and to regain fully its own active role in the Church and in history. This task, difficult yet providential, today calls for particular reflection, that it may be carried out with wisdom and farsightedness.\n5. The celebration of the Union of Brest should be lived and interpreted in the light of the teachings of the Second Vatican Council. This is perhaps the most important aspect for understanding the significance of the anniversary.\nIt is well known that the Second Vatican Council made a special point of studying the mystery of the Church, and that one of the most important documents which it produced was the Constitution Lumen gentium. Precisely because of this detailed study the Council takes on a particular ecumenical significance. This is confirmed by the Decree Unitatis redintegratio, which presents a very enlightened programme of activities to be carried out in the work for Christian unity. Thirty years after the conclusion of the Council, I wished to reiterate this programme with my Encyclical Letter Ut unum sint, published on 25 May of this year.9 This Encyclical traces the ecumenical progress which has been made since the Second Vatican Council and, at the same time, looking to the third millennium of the Christian era, it seeks to open up new possibilities for the future.\nPutting the celebrations of the coming year in the context of a reflection on the Church, as proposed by the Council, I am anxious above all to encourage a deeper understanding of the proper role which the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is called to play today in the ecumenical movement.\nTo promote dialogue with the Byzantine Orthodox Churches, there was set up, after the Second Vatican Council, a special Mixed Commission which also included among its members representatives of the Eastern Catholic Churches.\nIn various documents efforts have been made to arrive at a deeper and greater understanding between the Orthodox Churches and the Eastern Catholic Churches, efforts which have not been without positive results. In my Apostolic Letter Orientale lumen11 and in my Encyclical Letter Ut unum sint12 I have already written of the elements of sanctification and truth13 common to Eastern and Western Christianity, and of the desirable path to follow in the search for full communion between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches, in the light of the greater ecclesiological understanding brought about by the Second Vatican Council: \"Today we know that unity can be achieved through the love of God only if the Churches want it together, in full respect for the traditions of each and for necessary autonomy. We know that this can take place only on the basis of the love of Churches which feel increasingly called to manifest the one Church of Christ, born from one Baptism and from one Eucharist, and which want to be sisters\".14 The deepening of knowledge of the doctrine on the Church, brought about by the Council and continuing since the Council, has marked out what can be called a new path on the journey to unity: the path of the dialogue of truth nourished and sustained by the dialogue of charity (cf. Eph 4: 15).\n7. The shift from an underground existence has meant a radical change in the situation of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church: this Church has found itself facing the grave problems of rebuilding the structures of which it had been completely deprived and, more generally, it has had to commit itself to rediscovering itself fully, not only from within, but also in relation to the other Churches.\nThanks be to God for having enabled it to celebrate this jubilee with religious freedom regained. Thanks be to God also for the growth of the dialogue of charity, whereby significant progress has been made on the road to the much desired reconciliation with the Orthodox Churches.\nNumerous migrations and deportations have redrawn the religious geography of those lands; many years of official State atheism have profoundly affected people's minds; there is still not enough clergy to respond to the immense needs of religious and moral reconstruction: these are some of the more dramatic challenges facing all of the Churches.\nIn the face of these difficulties a common witness of charity is required, in order that the proclamation of the Gospel may not be impeded. As I said in my Apostolic Letter Orientale lumen, \"today we can co-operate in proclaiming the Kingdom or we can become the upholders of new divisions\".15 May the Lord guide our feet into the way of peace.\n8. In the new-found freedom we cannot forget the persecution and martyrdom which the Churches of that region, both Catholic and Orthodox, suffered in their own flesh. This is an important aspect for the Church of all times, as I recalled in my Apostolic Letter Tertio millennio adveniente.16 It concerns a particularly significant heritage of the Churches of Europe, which remain profoundly marked by it: this needs to be studied in the light of the Word of God.\nRemembrance of the martyrs cannot be erased from the memory of the Church or of humanity: whether victims of the ideologies of the East or of the West, all of them are brought together in fellowship by the violence whereby hatred for the faith violated the dignity of the human person, created by God \"in his image and likeness\".\nPope John XXIII was fond of repeating: \"What unites us is much greater than what divides us\". I am convinced that this attitude can be a great benefit to all the Churches. More than 30 years have gone by since the Pope made this statement. In this period of time there have been many indications which suggest to us that Christians have made progress in this direction. Eloquent signs of this progress have been the fraternal meetings between Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I, and those which I myself have had with the Ecumenical Patriarchs Dimitrios and, more recently, Bartholomaios, and with other venerable Patriarchs of the Churches of the East. All this, together with the many initiatives involving meetings and dialogue which are being promoted everywhere in the Church, encourages us to have hope: the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of unity, does not cease to work among Christians still separated from one another.\nAnd yet human weakness and sin continue to resist the Spirit of unity. Sometimes one even has the impression that there are forces ready to do almost anything in order to slow down, and even put an end to, the movement towards Christian unity. But we cannot give in: daily we must find the courage and strength, which at one and the same time are the gift of the Spirit and the result of human effort, to continue on the path already undertaken.\n10. In recalling the Union of Brest we must ask ourselves what this event means today. It was a union which concerned only a particular geographical region, but it is relevant for the entire field of ecumenism. The Eastern Catholic Churches can make a very important contribution to ecumenism. The Council's Decree Orientalium Ecclesiarum reminds us that \"the Eastern Churches in communion with the Apostolic See of Rome have a special role to play in promoting the unity of all Christians, particularly Easterners, according to the principles of this sacred Synod's Decree on Ecumenism: first of all by prayer, then by the example of their lives, by religious fidelity to ancient Eastern traditions, by greater mutual knowledge, by collaboration, and by a brotherly regard for objects and attitudes\".20 From this it follows that Eastern Catholics are to commit themselves to living profoundly what the Decree lays out. They are asked to make a confession of faith full of humility and gratitude to the Holy Spirit, who guides the Church towards the fulfilment promised her by the Redeemer of the world.\n11. Prayer will therefore be the fundamental element which should mark the celebration of this jubilee. Such prayer above all involves giving thanks for all that has been accomplished, down the centuries, by commitment to the Church's unity, and especially for the impulse given to the search for unity as a result of the Second Vatican Council.\nThis prayer is one of thanksgiving to the Lord, who guides the unfolding of history, for the situation of new-found religious freedom in which this jubilee is being celebrated. It is also an appeal to the Spirit-Paraclete, that he may cause to flourish everything which promotes unity, and may give courage and strength to all those who commit themselves, according to the guidelines of the Council's Decree Unitatis redintegratio, to this work blessed by God. It is a plea for the gift of brotherly love, and for the forgiveness of offences and injustices suffered in the course of history. It is a petition that the power of the living God will bring good even out of the cruel and many-faceted evil caused by acts of human malice. This prayer also expresses hope for the future of the ecumenical journey: the power of God is greater than all human weaknesses, whether old or new. If this jubilee of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, on the threshold of the third millennium, marks a step forward towards full Christian unity, this result will be first of all the work of the Holy Spirit.\n12. The jubilee celebrations should also be a time of reflection. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church must first of all ask itself what full communion with the Apostolic See meant for it in the past, and what it will mean for it in the future. In a spirit of humble thanksgiving, the Greek Catholic Church will give glory to God, for its heroic fidelity to the Successor of Peter and, under the action of the Holy Spirit, it will understand that today this same fidelity commits it to fostering the unity of all the Churches. This fidelity cost it sufferings and martyrdom in the past: this is a sacrifice offered to God in order to implore the hoped-for union.\n13. We cannot fail to entrust the yearning for full Christian unity to the Mother of Christ, she who is ever present in the work of the Lord and of his Church. Chapter Eight of the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen gentium points to her as the one who goes before us on our earthly pilgrimage of faith and is tenderly present to the Church which, at the end of the second millennium, is working to re-establish among all those who believe in Christ that unity which the Lord wills for them. Because she is the Mother of the one Christ, she is the Mother of unity. Since Mary, by the power of the Holy Spirit, gave birth to the Son of God, who received from her his human body, she ardently wills the visible unity of all believers who make up the Mystical Body of Christ. The veneration of Mary, which unites East and West so intimately, will serve, I am convinced, the cause of unity.\nThe Most Holy Virgin, already present everywhere in our midst both in so many sacred buildings and in the life of faith of so many families continuously speaks of unity, a unity for which she constantly intercedes. If today, in commemorating the Union of Brest, we recall the marvellous wealth of veneration that the Christian people of the Ukraine have offered to the Mother of God, we cannot but draw from this admiration for the history, spirituality and prayer of those peoples the consequences for unity which are so closely linked to those treasures.\nMary, who has inspired in their trials fathers and mothers, young people, the sick and the aged; Mary, the column of fire capable of guiding so many martyrs of the faith, is certainly at work in preparing the hoped-for union of all Christians: in the light of this, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church certainly has its own role to play.\nTo Mary the Church offers her thanks and asks her to make us share her concern for unity. With filial trust let us abandon ourselves to her, that we may be with her where God will be all in all.\nTo you, dear Brothers and Sisters, I impart my Apostolic Blessing.\nFrom the Vatican, on 12 November, Memorial of Saint Josaphat, in the year 1995, the eighteenth of my Pontificate.\n1) Cf.

{"text": "The ability to make decisions efficiently is an essential success factor for companies, regardless of the industry they are in. The faster a company is able to form shared views and rate ideas, the faster it can react and adapt to changes. As complexity increases, reaching decisions typically requires the input of various experts, which makes the decision making process slower. How to break bottle necks in decision making?\nHow to make decisions both collectively and as efficiently as possible? According to Juho Nevalainen, forming shared views becomes more efficient by using facilitation methods, by including only relevant people in the decision making process \u2013 and by rethinking the whole decision making forum, with the help of digital tools.\n1. Split large decision items into smaller, human-sized decision points.\nIn general, it is easier to reach small decisions than bigger ones. Try to split large decision items into into smaller decision points that you bring to the table one by one, by choosing the suitable facilitation methods in advance. This way, lenghty meetings can be avoided and you will reach the decision sooner.\nThe step-by-step approach gives you concrete results along the way. You will be able to react to changes faster and see the big picture more easily.\n2. Involve only the right people.\nReaching just the right decisions requires that the participants have a shared understanding on the matters \u2013 for example pros, cons, consequences, risks, opportunities and so on. If they do not, they will not commit themselves to the decision.\nIt is far easier to steer a smaller group of people than a bigger one. Make sure to involve only the people needed in each phase \u2013 do not invite anybody \u201djust in case\u201d, not even to virtual meetings.\n3. Instead of shared time, find a shared channel.\nOften, finding the suitable calendar slot for the meeting takes more time than the decision item itself. Even when the meeting is set, the agenda might need to be reset as someone cancels at the last minute.\nDuring the digital era, collaborative decision making does not need to depend on time or place. Thanks to new tools, busy key people can participate in the decision making no matter where they are located, when it suits them the best.\n\u201dIn our daily work, we use an online service called Roundtable that brings together the best sides of faciliation methods and social media. It requires from the decision makers only a daily engagement of 15 minutes, whenever they have the time\u201d, Nevalainen says.\nTime and place-independent online tools make collaborative decision making more efficient and also bring down the costs, as potential travel expenses decrease. However, according to Nevalainen, professional facilitation, management skills and promoting trust can not be replaced by any tools. When the working environment feels safe, people are willing to share their expertise collectively and are more likely to reach good decisions \u2013 no matter what the decision forum is.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T14:53:46Z", "url": "https://www.sofigate.com/news/3-smart-ways-to-accelerate-collaborative-decision-making/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

If you want to be successful, or at least not disastrous, you have to start thinking about strategy, objectives, and the means to get them now.\nCreate an overarching map: While it is critical that you pay attention to the fine print and little steps when setting up a business or partnership, it is just as important to see the forest for the trees, or keep an eye on the overall plan. Lay it all out in plain language for you to reference when matters get mixed up or complicated.\nChoose your headquarters: Every business must operate from somewhere, even if it reaches its market strictly through online methods. Brush up on local trends and zoning laws to see where your home base should go. If you are creating a partnership, consider where your partners are located as well. Is it going to be a problem if you have to travel long distances for in-person meetings?\nOrganize your finances: Before you get too far into the process, triple-check your finances, get them in order, and know what money is going to go where and for what purpose. The fastest route to business failure is letting your finances run free. If you need help planning how you or your business partners will dedicate resources, consider hiring a business accountant.\nStructure your business: Companies come in all shapes and sizes, whether you are going it alone or creating a partnership. Consider the benefits of LLCs, S corporations, nonprofit groups, and more before laying out the final groundwork of your business.\nName yourself: Arguably the simplest part of forming a business, registering a business name may also be the most important, especially if you are going to deal with consumers directly. Brand names are everything when a product is on a shelf or a service is listed online. Schedule some boardroom talks with any business partners to choose a business name that reflects your organization.\nTaxes, insurance, and permits: If you do not need to pay taxes and obtain licenses or permits before opening your business, you are probably not in America. You will need to obtain a tax identification number and acquire necessary permits, and may need to purchase different forms of insurance for potential employees, such as workers\u2019 compensation and disability.\nGet help: You should be proud of the business or partnership you have created and managed, but not so much that your pride gets in the way of its success. If you need help understanding a legal issue that is affecting your business, seek it out sooner than later.\nAt Schern Richardson Finter Decker, our Phoenix business consultation lawyers can work closely with you as you form a business, establishing a working partnership, or manage your company to ensure you never overlook important aspects or make a legal error. We are backed by an AV Preeminent\u00ae Rating by Martindale-Hubbell\u00ae and have an attorney selected to Super Laywers\u00ae Rising Stars\u2120 on our team.

{"text": "Gestational Diabetes Mellitus - Home Treatment.\nJust like any type of diabetes, gestational diabetes needs more than medicine to get it treated successfully. It needs you, for you are the person who determines the health of your pregnancy.\nYour registered dietitian, diabetes educator, your doctor and other members of your healthcare team can teach you about proper care for yourself and your baby so that both of you are protected from any complications that may arise. If you have all the necessary knowledge available on gestational diabetes, there can be no problem during and after your pregnancy. Once you know the effects of exercise and food on your blood glucose levels, you can avoid gestational diabetes complications.\nTesting your blood glucose level, regular exercise and changes in the time, amount and types of food you eat are important in gestational diabetes home treatment.\nChanging the type of food you eat, eating at regular times and the quantity consumed at each meal can ensure that your blood glucose level remain in a safe range. After your gestational diabetes diagnosis, a registered dietitian will help you to plan meals suitable for you. You may be required to keep a record of the foods you consume and your weight. Your dietitian will also show you how to carbohydrate counting so that you eat almost the same amount at each meal to reach a certain total at the end of each day.\nModerate exercise done regularly throughout the pregnancy improves the sensitivity of your body towards insulin and this helps blood glucose level control. Most of the time, eating the right foods and exercise are sufficient for gestational diabetes treatment. There should be a minimum of two and a half hours of moderate exercise each week. To accomplish this takes only 30 minutes of exercise each day for five days or more a week. You can even do 10 minute sessions so long as you get a total of 2\u00c2\u00bd hours each week.\nFor pregnant women who have been leading a sedentary life or have no regular exercise before pregnancy, they need to discuss with their doctor before any regular exercise. Suitable exercises for pregnant women are those that do not strain the lower part of the body. So, it is fine to exercise the arm muscles by using a machine known as the arm ergometer; or exercise the leg muscles by using a recumbent bike which has a chair-like seat that is suitable for women who are pregnant. There are also exercise classes especially for women who are pregnant. Walking and swimming are two low-impact exercises which are also suitable.\nIf it is possible for you to get your blood glucose to remain in the safe range through changes in your eating and exercise, it will not be necessary for you to take any diabetes medication. However, if you need insulin, keep ready with you some sugary food like 4 glucose tablets or some hard candy so that you can use them if you get low blood glucose symptoms such as confusion, blurred vision and sweating during exercise. If you believe your blood glucose level is too low, stop the activity, test your blood glucose level, and consume the sugary foods you have.\nDoing home blood glucose level testing is a necessary part of gestational diabetes treatment. You will need to do blood glucose checking at home at least once every day. It can be tough when you have to check your blood glucose frequently but from such testing, you will know you have no need to worry as your blood glucose level is in the safe range. Find out from your doctor how often you should check your blood glucose.\nDaily insulin injections may be necessary if your blood glucose level cannot be managed through exercising and the way you eat.\nDo not attempt to reduce weight during pregnancy if you were already overweight before the pregnancy. Find out from your doctor the possible weight increase during your pregnancy.\nYou may be taught by your doctor to count the number of kicks by your baby. You are required to notify your doctor if there is less than the usual number of kicks from the baby.\nYour blood glucose level can go lower than the safe range if you use insulin for your gestational diabetes. Although women with gestational diabetes seldom experience low blood glucose, you should know its symptoms and be prepared with sugary foods throughout the day.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T03:44:42Z", "url": "http://www.ada-diabetes-management.com/gestational-diabetes-home-treatment/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The Philippines of recent years has witnessed a spectacular turnaround. Over the past decade, the country has averaged 5% GDP growth each year. Sound economic fundamentals - such as declining debt and low inflation - and a workforce that is young, diverse, educated and English-speaking has made the Philippines a rising star poised to seize the opportunities of the global economy.\nThe new administration, elected in May, has professed its commitment to the further liberalization of trade through free trade agreements. Its eagerness to join the mega-regional TPP is palpable. \"The new government is one that will keep the policy of maximizing foreign trade agreements participation,\u201d Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said in August.\nWhen the ASEAN Economic Community was established last year, the Philippines also joined nine other nations to form an enormous market of $2.6 trillion and 622 million people. Together, they are the third largest economy in Asia and the seventh largest in the world.\nThe United States is the Philippines\u2019 third largest trading partner, and gives the Philippines preferential duty-free access to U.S. markets under the Generalized System of Preferences. $16.5 billion worth of goods was exchanged between the two countries in 2015. Looking forward, we can expect the United States and the Philippines to continue its tradition of robust trade.\nFilipino exports are driven by the manufacturing sector. A labor force that is hardworking and highly educated gives the country a competitive edge in manufacturing. If you take a look at the top 10 exports from the Philippines in 2015 - which accounted for 83.5% of exports - eight are manufactured goods.\nFrom wood products to transport equipment, manufactured goods of all shapes and sizes come out of the Philippines. By far, the hottest manufacturing export is electronics - and that subsector is dominated by semiconductors. Electronics was easily the biggest export in all five of the largest destination markets for Filipino goods: Japan, U.S., China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. We should also mention that the Philippines is one of the top seafood exporting countries in the world, particularly tuna. Even so, the Philippines is far from producing seafood at its highest capacity given its long coastline and inland bodies of water, which means that there is plenty of untapped potential for this export in the future.\nThe growth of imports into the Philippines since the beginning of 2016 is fueled by increases in consumer demand, capital goods, and new construction. In spite of the downturn in the global economy, consumer confidence is high in the Philippines. Consumer goods, which comprise 17.9% of imports, increased 47.2% year-over-year in May. Consumer spending in the Philippines has buoyed the economy, rising from 63% of GDP a decade ago to three-quarters today. This phenomenon is underpinned in part by remittances from 2.3 million strong Filipinos who work abroad and further propelled by the explosion of foreign tourists \u2013 many from China - spending money while traveling in the Philippines. The country\u2019s young population will be a driving force for domestic demand in future years as well.\nFavorable demographics will continue to help the Philippines become a destination for manufacturing. As exports grow and the spending power of Filipinos rise, imports will continue on an upward trajectory \u2013 both because of consumer demand and the need to bring in raw materials for processing. The Philippines was once called \u201cthe sick man of Asia\u201d because of poor economic policies that kept the country from taking off. Today, it\u2019s well on its way to resuming its coveted position as a hotspot in global trade.\nTo meet the growing demand for international and domestic freight forwarding in the Philippines, AGWorld has opened a Manila office. We will focus on air and ocean freight (import and export), customs, and domestic trucking services. Our Manila outpost will also offer value added services that many local forwarders lack, including tracking capabilities that give our customers visibility into shipments at all times. AGWorld staff in the Philippines boast 50+ years of experience in the logistics industry.

As promised, it\u2019s now available for downloading.\nAs with our other free tools, the download(s) for HyperSnapshot can be found from here, our community tools page. While both the host -based and guest -based components are really small in size, we decided to have a separate ZIP file for each.\nFor the Hyper-V host machine(s) you will need to have HyperSnapshot\u2019s host -package, which has one [service] executable (HyperSnapshotService.exe) and installation + removal scripts. Once installed, the service will run in the background responding automatically to the requests made from the virtual machine (guest systems), with zero configuration necessary. The service is engineered so that it try and use as little of resources possible on the host system, which in effect means no continuous polling of VMs but rather responding to changes as indicated by WMI eventing system.\nFor all the virtual machines you wish to have guest-based snapshot functionality enabled, guest -package needs to be downloaded and extracted to. Since we do not have an installer \u2013 at least at this point in time \u2013 the client executable (HyperSnapshotGui.exe) has to be started manually by the user or shortcut created for it. Please note that like written in the previous article, the client executable needs elevation in order to function properly.

(\u201cEuro Disney\u201d) at a price of \u20ac2.00 per share, increasing its interest in Euro Disney to 85.7%.

Moreover, Disney has informed Euro Disney that it is committed to support a recapitalization of up to \u20ac1.5 billion for the Euro Disney group of companies (\u201cGroup\u201d) to enable the Group to continue implementation of improvements to Disneyland\u00ae Paris, reduce debt and increase liquidity.\n\u2013 If Euro Disney remains a listed company, Disney would expect the recapitalization to take the form of a subscription by the applicable Disney subsidiaries of their pro-rata share of a \u20ac1.23 billion rights offering by Euro Disney together with a backstop of (and at the same price as) the rights offering by one or more of such subsidiaries, ensuring that Euro Disney will be able to raise the full amount contemplated by the rights offering, combined with a direct \u20ac270 million cash investment in equity at the level of Euro Disney Associ\u00e9s S.C.A., the main operating subsidiary of Euro Disney, and contribution of the proceeds of the rights offering by Euro Disney to Euro Disney Associ\u00e9s S.C.A. to maintain the ownership level of Euro Disney Associ\u00e9s S.C.A. by Euro Disney at its current 82%.

{"text": "Let\u2019s take a dive into some of the things we\u2019re working on behind the scenes!\nWe\u2019re looking at ways to make battling, building, and moving in Fortnite feel great on controller. We took an initial step with Builder Pro and feedback from you to create a better experience for console players swapping between building pieces.\nWe heard your feedback about Builder Pro feeling inconsistent. Sometimes after quickly switching to a building piece, it would not place when you pressed the button. Similarly, Turbo Building could force you to let go and re-press to start building again, making it unreliable. We\u2019ve fixed these issues, and Builder Pro should feel consistent.\nIn the v4.3 update we\u2019ve fixed various reported problems with the Turbo Building feature, such as building being cancelled while cycling through traps or after pressing certain combinations of buttons.\nWe\u2019ve also made Turbo Building faster so that gaps won\u2019t appear in your structures when aiming quickly. The first time you begin building it takes 0.15 seconds to build, but each piece after that is faster (0.05 seconds). Combined with Builder Pro, this gives you enough time to select a piece and rotate or edit it before placing.\nWhen playing with a controller and using Edit Mode to modify your buildings, aim assist will kick in and pull your crosshair toward the closest square. It will also try to confine your aim to the building piece you're editing. We've heard that some players find this feature uncomfortable to play with, so you'll be able to toggle Edit Mode Aim Assist off in the v4.3 update.\nLooking to the future, we want to provide for the best experience on console and that involves giving you the options to play however you wish. We\u2019re investigating giving you ways to bind actions to whichever buttons you would prefer to use. Additionally we\u2019re investigating other aspects like stick axis remapping. We\u2019re not sure when this will land, but we\u2019ll give you more info once its fully tested!\nWe\u2019ve been using LTMs to take existing aspects of the game and try new things with them (i.e. legendary loot in Solid Gold or faster games in Blitz). We look at LTMs as a space that allows us to explore different tweaks to the main game mode (e.g. Building Resources) and do things we wouldn\u2019t normally do in standard playlists.\nWe\u2019ve heard you about your love for 50v50 and we\u2019re currently evaluating keeping a larger squad mode live at all times for those who enjoy that type of battling more!\nWe took our first step into what a competitive playlist may look like with Solo Showdown. Creating a separate space for players who wanted to compete towards a prize while exploring how competitive play might look in Fortnite.\nWe introduced the Jetpack this week as our a Limited Time Item. Our goal is to introduce items that change gameplay in big & unique ways. We\u2019re going to keep a close eye on your feedback and the data we collect. You\u2019ll also see the Jetpack featured in our Close Encounter LTM going live tomorrow!\nThe Playground LTM will load you into the Battle Royale Map with some adjusted settings.\nBattle and build to your heart's content with an extended period of time to roam around the map as well as increased resource generation. All treasure chests and ammo crates will be spawned, try droppin\u2019 in different spots and scope out the loot. Friendly fire is on so you can scrimmage with your squad (up to 4 friends per match), but fear not you\u2019ll respawn immediately.\nOh \u2026 and Lloads of Llamas.\nThis represents our initial step into what a creative mode looks like in Fortnite. Practice, strategize and enjoy yourself. We can\u2019t wait to see what you do!\nWhen you hop on to play Fortnite after a long day at work or in classes we want that first match to feel as good as the last one. Performance is an aspect of the game that is very important to us and something we are committed to improving over time. Here are a few of the ways we\u2019re working to smooth out your daily play!\nIn the v4.1 update we issued a hotfix to address some long hitches, but we\u2019re still seeing reports of these hitches in our data. We\u2019ve added additional logging and diagnostics to help us track down issues that can cause the game to freeze. When you use in the in-game feedback report feature, it will allow us to diagnose these issues.\nWe know that many of the hitches happen because the game is stopping to load content at unexpected times in the middle of the match, instead of smoothly streaming the data in the background. The game will now be able to directly report these loading problems to our team. We've also added a new system to more reliably pre-load content before the match starts, so that new loading hitches don't sneak back into future updates.\nWe want to get you into a match in as short a time as possible after you hit play! We\u2019ve been working to improve file performance, ensure cosmetics are loaded in time, and reducing overall load times. By optimizing order of assets in our patches we reduced load times on console by 15-30 seconds in the v3.5 update. Each major release we regularly update the order of assets in order to keep load times down.\nWe recently boosted the server tick rates from 20 Hz to a solid 30 Hz in standard game modes. This means the server is updating the game 50% faster than before and should improve the responsiveness of your actions in the game. But we still have work to do. Fast and consistent server performance is extremely important to us, and we\u2019re still working hard at it.\nOur next goal is to ensure that \u201clarge team\u201d LTMs like 50v50 are hitting 30Hz for the entire match.\nFor large team modes we\u2019ve made optimizations to adapt and update players based on what they\u2019re doing in game. Players who are standing still don\u2019t need to update everyone around them very frequently compared to players who are running and gunning. Similarly, very distant players are updated less frequently, especially players that aren't visible to you. These optimizations allow our servers to handle larger numbers of players.\nCurrently the game throttles the frequency that your player's movement data is sent over the network to 20Hz for roughly the first half of the game. This is reduce strain on the server's physics system, allowing it to maintain frame rate. As the number of players participating in the match reduces to 24, we increase the frequency of updates to 33Hz. Over time we\u2019ll improve performance of server physics calculations, and we expect to be able to remove this throttling in a future update.\nWe\u2019re continuing to improve the core gameplay experience, and have a number of features in progress!\nStarting in v4.3 there will be in-match pop ups to highlight your challenge progress. Track what you\u2019ve completed and plan out your strategy for the remainder of the match or your next one!\nMarking positions on the map is a great way to communicate with your squad, but often the marker on the compass isn\u2019t enough to get you to your location. We\u2019re investigating ways to display an in-world marker to allow for easier navigation around the island.\nGetting a Victory Royale should be a memorable experience, and the victory screen should support that. We want to freshen up the celebration and make it a bit more rewarding.\nThe ability to zoom in on the map was added in a recent update, but the resolution of the image isn\u2019t quite as good as we want it to be. Our goal is to capture the world with as many details as possible to make it easier when figuring out where you're droppin\u2019!\nOur v4.2 update had some footstep audio improvements, where we added slightly more variation to above/below sounds. We recognize it\u2019s still difficult to identify enemy position in high-density locations (such as Tilted Towers) and we\u2019ll continue to iterate on this.\nAll outfits and cosmetics have value. We want to add ways for you to gain additional goodies through collection over time! This is work in progress - and it\u2019s a little further out.\nIn preparation for our Celebrity Pro-Am at E3 we've been hard at work making some improvements to the replay system.\nWe\u2019re developing new camera features that allow you to orbit around any point of your choosing as well having the camera automatically track the action for you by focusing on a group of players, rather than just one person.\nWe\u2019ve also been refining the map view in replays to add more functionality to the playerlist and to add bullet trajectories to the player markers on the map. Additionally, player nameplates have been tweaked to avoid overlapping where possible.\nFinally, we\u2019ve also been looking at improving player outlines and adding an x-ray view for when players enter buildings or actively building themselves so that you always have the best view of what\u2019s happening.\nWe're excited to get these new features and improvements into everyone's hands and will be releasing them as part of the game as soon as they are battle tested and ready! Keep an eye on our patch notes for all the details.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T22:03:26Z", "url": "https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/state-of-development-v5?lang=en-US", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "We all have read the tales told of Jesus in the Gospels, but few people really have a good idea of their context. Yet it is quite enlightening to examine them against the background of the time and place in which they were written, and my goal here is to help you do just that. There is abundant evidence that these were times replete with kooks and quacks of all varieties, from sincere lunatics to ingenious frauds, even innocent men mistaken for divine, and there was no end to the fools and loons who would follow and praise them. Placed in this context, the gospels no longer seem to be so remarkable, and this leads us to an important fact: when the Gospels were written, skeptics and informed or critical minds were a small minority. Although the gullible, the credulous, and those ready to believe or exaggerate stories of the supernatural are still abundant today, they were much more common in antiquity, and taken far more seriously.\nIf the people of that time were so gullible or credulous or superstitious, then we have to be very cautious when assessing the reliability of witnesses of Jesus. As Thomas Jefferson believed when he composed his own version of the gospels, Jesus may have been an entirely different person than the Gospels tell us, since the supernatural and other facts about him, even some of his parables or moral sayings, could easily have been added or exaggerated by unreliable witnesses or storytellers. Thus, this essay is not about whether Jesus was real or how much of what we are told about him is true. It is not even about Jesus. Rather, this essay is a warning and a standard, by which we can assess how likely or easily what we are told about Jesus may be false or exaggerated, and how little we can trust anyone who claims to be a witness of what he said and did. For if all of these other stories below could be told and believed, even by Christians themselves, it follows that the Gospels, being of entirely the same kind, can all too easily be inaccurate, tainted by the gullibility, credulity, or fondness for the spectacular which characterized most people of the time.\nEven in Acts, we get an idea of just how gullible people could be. Surviving a snake bite was evidently enough for the inhabitants of Malta to believe that Paul himself was a god (28:6). And Paul and his comrade Barnabas had to go to some lengths to convince the Lycaonians of Lystra that they were not deities. For the locals immediately sought to sacrifice to them as manifestations of Hermes and Zeus, simply because a man with bad feet stood up (14:8-18). These stories show how ready people were to believe that gods can take on human form and walk among them, and that a simple show was sufficient to convince them that mere men were such divine beings. And this evidence is in the bible itself.\nBeyond the bible, the historian Josephus supplies some insights. Writing toward the end of the first century, himself an eye-witness of the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D, he tells us that the region was filled with \"cheats and deceivers claiming divine inspiration\" (Jewish War, 2.259-60; Jewish Antiquities, 20.167), entrancing the masses and leading them like sheep, usually to their doom. The most successful of these \"tricksters\" appears to be \"the Egyptian\" who led a flock of 30,000 believers around Palestine (Jewish War, 2.261-2; Paul is mistaken for him by a Roman officer in Acts 21:38). This fellow even claimed he could topple the walls of Jerusalem with a single word (Jewish Antiquities, 20.170), yet it took a massacre at the hands of Roman troops to finally instill doubt in his followers.\nTwenty years later, a common weaver named Jonathan would attract a mob of the poor and needy, promising to show them many signs and portents (Jewish War, 7.437-8). Again, it took military intervention to disband the movement. Josephus also names a certain Theudas, another \"trickster\" who gathered an impressive following in Cyrene around 46 A.D., claiming he was a prophet and could part the river Jordan (Jewish Antiquities, 20.97). This could be the same Theudas mentioned in Acts 5:36. Stories like these also remind us of the faithful following that Simon was reported to have had in Acts 8:9-11, again showing how easy it was to make people believe you had \"the power of god\" at your disposal. Jesus was not unique in that respect.\nMiracles were also a dime a dozen in this era. The biographer Plutarch, a contemporary of Josephus, engages in a lengthy digression to prove that a statue of Tyche did not really speak in the early Republic (Life of Coriolanus 37.3). He claims it must have been a hallucination inspired by the deep religious faith of the onlookers, since there were, he says, too many reliable witnesses to dismiss the story as an invention (38.1-3). He even digresses further to explain why other miracles such as weeping or bleeding--even moaning--statues could be explained as natural phenomena, showing a modest but refreshing degree of skeptical reasoning that would make the Amazing Randi proud. What is notable is not that Plutarch proves himself to have some good sense, but that he felt it was necessary to make such an argument at all. Clearly, such miracles were still reported and believed in his own time. I find this to be a particularly interesting passage, since we have thousands of believers flocking to weeping and bleeding statues even today. Certainly the pagan gods must also exist if they could make their statues weep and bleed as well!\nMiraculous healings were also commonplace. Suetonius, another biographer writing a generation after Plutarch, reports that even the emperor Vespasian once cured the blind and lame (Life of Vespasian 7.13; this \"power\" being attributed to the god Serapis--incidentally the Egyptian counterpart to Asclepius; cf. also Tacitus, Histories 4.81). Likewise, statues with healing powers were common attractions for sick people of this era. Lucian mentions the famous healing powers of a statue of Polydamas, an athlete, at Olympia, as well as the statue of Theagenes at Thasos (Council of the Gods 12). Both are again mentioned by Pausanias, in his \"tour guide\" of the Roman world (6.5.4-9, 11.2-9). Lucian also mentions the curative powers of the statue of a certain General Pellichos (Philopseudes 18-20). And Athenagoras, in his Legatio pro Christianis (26), polemicizes against the commonplace belief in the healing powers of statues, mentioning, in addition to the statue of a certain Neryllinus, the statues of Proteus and Alexander, the same two men I discuss in detail below.\nBut above all these, the \"pagans\" had Asclepius, their own healing savior, centuries before, and after, the ministry of Christ. Surviving testimonies to his influence and healing power throughout the classical age are common enough to fill a two-volume book (Edelstein and Edelstein, Asclepius: A Collection and Interpretation of the Testimonies, in two volumes, 1945--entries 423-450 contain the most vivid testimonials). Of greatest interest are the inscriptions set up for those healed at his temples. These give us almost first hand testimony, more reliable evidence than anything we have for the miracles of Jesus, of the blind, the lame, the mute, even the victims of kidney stones, paralytics, and one fellow with a spearhead stuck in his jaw (see the work cited above, p. 232), all being cured by this pagan \"savior.\" And this testimony goes on for centuries. Inscriptions span from the 4th century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. and later, all over the Roman Empire. Clearly, the people of this time were quite ready to believe such tales. They were not remarkable tales at all.\nThis more general evidence of credulity in the Roman Empire shows the prevalence of belief in divine miracle working of all kinds. I will now present you with three historical individuals who truly flesh out the picture.\nApollonius, Peregrinus, and Alexander are three rather interesting religious founders about whom we know even more than we do of Jesus. The first, Apollonius of Tyana, is often called the \"pagan Christ,\" since he also lived during the first century, and performed a similar ministry of miracle-working, preaching his own brand of ascetic Pythagoreanism--he was also viewed as the son of a god, resurrected the dead, ascended to heaven, performed various miracles, and criticized the authorities with pithy wisdom much like Jesus did.\nNaturally, his story is one that no doubt grew into more and more fantastic legends over time, until he becomes an even more impressive miracle-worker than Jesus in the largest surviving work on him, The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, written by Philostratus around 220 A.D. This work is available today in two volumes as part of the Loeb Classical Library, published by Harvard University Press, a set that also includes the surviving fragments of Apollonius' own writings (if only Jesus had bothered to write something!) as well as the Treatise against him by the Christian historian Eusebius. There were other books written about him immediately after his death, but none survive.\nEven Eusebius, in his Treatise against Apollonius, does not question his existence, or the reality of many of his miracles--rather, he usually tries to attribute them to trickery or demons. This shows the credulity of the times, even among educated defenders of the Christian faith, but it also shows how easy it was to deceive. Since they readily believed in demons and magical powers, it should not surprise us that they believed in resurrections and transmutations of water to wine.\nWe also know that the cult that grew up around Apollonius survived for many centuries after his death. An inscription from as late as the 3rd century names him as a sort of pagan \"absolver of sins,\" sent from heaven (Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd ed., 1996). The emperor Caracalla erected a shrine to him in Tyana around 215 A.D (Dio Cassius, 78.18; for a miraculous display of clairvoyance on the part of Apollonius, see 67.18). According to one account, the ghost of Apollonius even appeared to the emperor Aurelian to convince him to stop his siege of Tyana, whereupon he also erected a shrine to him around 274 A.D. (Historia Augusta: Vita Aureliani 24.2-6).\nLater Arabic sources even discuss the fame and potency of certain relics associated with him, which remained in use well into the sixth and seventh centuries, the last of them apparently destroyed by crusaders in 1204 A.D. So popular was the belief in the power of these \"talismans\" that the Church was forced to accept their use, even while condemning Apollonius and his shrines as demonic (see sources below). And so, we see here an independent confirmation that blind belief in the divine status and miraculous powers of mere mortals easily captivated the people of this time, a fact that even modern Christians must admit.\nAn even more colorful story is that of a crazy fellow called Peregrinus, nicknamed \"Proteus,\" who set himself on fire during the Olympic games in 165 A.D. to prove his faith in reincarnation. The notion of suicide as a proof of such faith was not new. Indian Brahmans had immolated themselves before Western audiences on several occasions before, the most famous being Calanus, at Susa, in front of Alexander the Great, and Zarmarus, at Athens, in front of Augustus (Plutarch, Alexander 69.8). What is most relevant, however, is the fascinating story told about him by the skeptic Lucian in his satirical work, \"The Death of Peregrinus.\" Lucian knew Proteus personally, and he gives us a look at what the story of Jesus might have been had a skeptic been around to give us a different account.\nWhile Aulus Gellius had also met this man in Athens, and was impressed enough to call him a man of \"dignity and fortitude\" (Attic Nights 11.1-7), Lucian had another point of view. He describes the vainglorious motivations of Proteus, and the duped mobs clamoring for a miracle. He also mentions the gullibility of Christians, who, he says, were easily duped by scam artists (13). Indeed, after the death of Peregrinus, people reported that he was, like Jesus, risen from the dead, wearing white raiment, and that he ascended to heaven in the form of a vulture (40). The punch line is that this latter story may have been a deliberate invention of Lucian himself (39), told to gullible followers, and later recounted to him as if it were fact, showing the effects of the rumor mill at work. Indeed, even people who were in the same city at the time were ready to believe that an earthquake accompanied his death, reminding us of the absurd miracles surrounding the death of Jesus recounted without a blush in Matthew 27:51-54. How easy it was for such stories to be believed! Even if this tale is filled with rhetoric on the part of Lucian, his criticism of gullibility would have no weight if it did not ring true.\nPeregrinus also had a small cult following after his death. His staff was treated as a religious relic (Lucian, The Ignorant Book Collector 14), his disciples preached his doctrine (Lucian, Runaways), and his statue healed the sick and gave oracles (Athenagoras, cited above). But his bid for religious glory was not as successful as another man, Alexander of Abonuteichos. Lucian dedicates an even longer and more vicious account of his personal contacts with this man, whom he calls \"the quack prophet.\" The account alone is detailed and entertaining, but for our present purpose it illustrates how easy it was to invent a god and watch the masses scurry to worship it. His scam began around 150 A.D. and lasted well beyond his death in 170 A.D., drawing the patronage of emperors and provincial governors as well as the commons. His cult may have even lasted into the 4th century, although the evidence is unclear.\nThe official story was that a snake-god with a human head was born as an incarnation of Asclepius, and Alexander was his keeper and intermediary. With this arrangement Alexander gave oracles, offered intercessory prayers, and even began his own mystery religion. Lucian tells us the inside story. Glycon was in fact a trained snake with a puppet head, and all the miracles surrounding him were either tall tales or the ingenious tricks of Alexander himself. But what might we think had there been no Lucian to tell us this? So credulous was the public as well as the government, that a petition to change the name of the town where the god lived, and to strike a special coin in his honor (Lucian, Alexander 58), was heeded, and we have direct confirmation of both facts: such coins have been found, dating from the reign of Antoninus Pius and continuing up into the 3rd century, bearing the unique image of a human-headed snake god. Likewise, the town of Abonuteichos was petitioned to be renamed Ionopolis, and the town is today known as Ineboli, a clear derivation. Even statues, inscriptions, and other carvings survive, attesting to this Alexander and his god Glycon and their ensuing cult (Culture and Society in Lucian, pp. 138, 143).\nAs for his influence, Lucian tells us that Severianus, the governor of Cappadocia, was killed in Armenia because he believed an oracle of Alexander's (27), and Rutilianus, the governor of Moesia and Asia, was also a devout follower, and even married Alexander's daughter. Indeed, Alexander's \"god\" was so popular that people rushed all the way from Rome to consult him (30), and even the emperor Marcus Aurelius sought his prophecy (48). From this it is all the more apparent that religious crazes were a dime a dozen in the time and place of the Gospels, helping to explain why a new and strange religion like Christianity could become so popular, and its claims--which to us sound absurd--could be so readily believed.\nThe final lesson from the case of Alexander and Peregrinus is that Lucian's skeptical debunking never persuaded any believers, showing that even the rare skeptic, no matter how convincing his arguments and evidence, could have no practical effect on the credulous. The vast majority would never read or hear anything he wrote, and most of those who did would dismiss it. Indeed, believers were hostile to critical thought and would shout the skeptics down and drive off even suspected doubters in their midst, as actually happened in the case of Alexander: before every ceremony, the congregation would cry \"Away with the Epicureans! Away with the Christians!\" (and atheists and unbelievers in general: 38) since these two groups had a reputation for trying to debunk popular religion (this hostility could even come to slander and violence: 25). In effect, this was like clamping their hands over their ears and humming, deliberately refusing even to hear reasonable arguments, much less to consider their force.\nFrom all of this one thing should be apparent: the age of Jesus was not an age of critical reflection and remarkable religious acumen. It was an era filled with con artists, gullible believers, martyrs without a cause, and reputed miracles of every variety. In light of this picture, the tales of the Gospels do not seem very remarkable. Even if they were false in every detail, there is no evidence that they would have been disbelieved or rejected as absurd by many people, who at the time had little in the way of education or critical thinking skills. They had no newspapers, telephones, photographs, or public documents to consult to check a story. If they were not a witness, all they had was a man's word. And even if they were a witness, the tales above tell us that even then their skills of critical reflection were lacking. Certainly, this age did not lack keen and educated skeptics--it is not that there were no skilled and skeptical observers. There were. Rather, the shouts of the credulous rabble overpowered their voice and seized the world from them, boldly leading them all into the darkness of a thousand years of chaos. Perhaps we should not repeat the same mistake. After all, the wise learn from history. The fool ignores it.\nGlenn Miller has written a rebuttal to this essay (\"Were the Miracles of Jesus invented by the Disciples/Evangelists?\" 2002), in response to which I changed some of the language above so as not to give a mistaken impression of my meaning. Miller's title has little to do with my essay, since I am not arguing here (even if I do elsewhere) that anyone in particular \"invented\" the miracles of Jesus. Rather, I am merely presenting a survey of the social and intellectual context in which those miracles came to be believed.\nAs to the remainder of Miller's criticism of this essay specifically, I plan to respond in a future rebuttal (which will be announced here). But one simple point must be made even now: almost all of Miller's relevant evidence comes from the educated or even scholarly elite (like Lucian), and thus in no way represents the average man or woman in antiquity, who by their very circumstance wrote nothing for Miller to examine. I would guess that skilled skeptics and skeptical viewpoints like those Miller finds probably could not be found in much more than 10% of the population of the time, if even that--but whose existence I acknowledged even in the original draft of this essay.\nThe fact that pagan miracle working is not much heard of today is in large part due to the more effective Christian propaganda during the Empire and, of course, a thousand years of censorship afterward. An excellent discussion of the former, and how it contributed to the eventual success of the Church, is given by Thomas Matthews in The Clash of the Gods: A Reinterpretation of Christian Art (1993). For a broad comparative study of holy men of all faiths (Christian, pagan, and Jewish) in the time of Jesus, an excellent source is Sage, Saint, and Sophist: Holy Men and their Associates in the Early Roman Empire, by Graham Anderson (1994). Both are highly recommended.\nThe most extensive study on the historicity of Apollonius as well as his cult and legend can be found in the otherwise dry work by Maria Dzielska, Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History, translated by Piotr Pienkowski (L'Erma di Bretschneider, 1986). Interested scholars should begin there. In particular, the source tradition on his magic \"talismans\" is a complicated affair, but their history and reluctant acceptance by the Church is discussed at great length by Dzielska in chapter 3. As for Lucian, his works about Peregrinus and Alexander are available in a very readable and engaging English translation in Lionel Casson's Selected Satires of Lucian (1962). These two stories are a very fun read, and well worth seeking out. An excellent survey and analysis of Lucian's works and his surrounding culture is available in Culture and Society in Lucian by C. P. Jones (1986). This is, in fact, a must-read for anyone interested in the contrast between free thought and gullibility in the Roman Empire. It has entire chapters dedicated to Peregrinus and Alexander. Finally, Lucian's Philopseudes (or \"Lover of Lies\") is a virtual treasure trove of examples of ancient credulity and superstition that is a must-read source on the subject (it can be found in vol. 3 of Lucian's works in the Loeb Classical Library).", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T18:52:02Z", "url": "https://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/kooks.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "London Marathon 2017: why I\u2019m running for the RSPCA.\n\u2026No, I didn\u2019t get in. The rejection mag landed in my letterbox as predicted.\nBut what I did get was a very exciting phone call from the super lovely team at the RSPCA asking if perhaps I would consider the London Marathon for them instead of Brighton. I pretended to consider it for all of about 30 seconds before declaring rather excitedly that yes, yes I would, and please don\u2019t change your minds thank you very much please.\nFortunately, they didn\u2019t change their minds and I will indeed be running the London Marathon 2017 as part of the amazing #TeamAnimal.\nI know a lot of runners who don\u2019t like the idea of taking up a charity place, or fundraising on a ballot place, and I totally get it; the idea of raising money can be really daunting. But how often in my life do I do something that\u2019s worthy of being sponsored for? The stat that\u2019s banded around a lot is that only 1% of the population will ever run a marathon \u2013 so it\u2019s something to be celebrated, respected and definitely worth people digging deep for. I mean, they\u2019ll probably just be relieved that it\u2019s not them who has to run a stupidly long way.\nSo why the RSPCA? Well, it\u2019s a charity that\u2019s been close to my heart since I was as young as 3 \u2013 when my first cat came into my life in the shape of an RSPCA rescue tabby called Amber. He lived with us until the grand old age of 18 and I have since had two more pet cats \u2013 both adopted from the charity. No pet owner needs to be told the value of having an animal in your life, and I\u2019m a very strong advocate of adopting animals in need rather than buying them. I was also an active member of the Junior RSPCA squad as a kid, and was about as animal obsessed as you can get.\nMister Dinosaur. What do you mean you can tell my toddler named him?\nWith the charity being so high on my radar and it being such a well recognised name, I was really surprised to find out that they are often overlooked when it comes to people fundraising for them at running events, which made me more determined than ever to highlight their work and raise as much money as I can.\nAnd by \u2018all animals\u2019 they really do mean all animals \u2013 it isn\u2019t just pets that they aim to help, it\u2019s farm animals, wild animals, and those used in testing and research. That\u2019s an awful lot of animals and an awful lot of money needed to keep it going. The amount of money I\u2019m aiming to raise seems like a lot, but compared to how much money the charity needs to keep on doing the amazing work it does, it\u2019s a drop in the ocean.\nWith that in mind I would urge anyone who is considering running a marathon \u2013 or any running event \u2013 to consider looking at the RSPCA charity places (they currently have places available for London Marathon, Brighton Marathon and the Great North Run) or using your ballot place (you lucky devils you) to raise funds as part of Team Animal.\nIt says Team Animal, obvs.\nHave a glance at this page \u2013 it\u2019ll tell you all you need to know.\nI\u2019ll be keeping you updated on my training, but for now here are some more cute pictures of my cats.\nNext Post A weekend to remember.\nThats amazing.hope you enjoy it.any marathon is a big achievement for anyone.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T18:41:35Z", "url": "https://teacupsandtrainers.com/2016/10/30/london-marathon-2017-why-im-running-for-the-rspca/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

When planning your retirement options, we want to make sure we offer a variety of plans.\nWe are part of the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS). Instead of participating in Social Security, CalOptima employees contribute a percentage of their pre-tax earnings to their CalPERS account. CalOptima contributes the same percentage of the employee\u2019s regular earnings into this account. This is a defined benefit retirement plan in which the retirement benefit is based on the employee's years of service, final/highest compensation, and age at retirement. Regular, full-time employees become vested in the plan after five years of service.\nWe also offer a Defined Contribution Supplemental Retirement Plan through the Public Agency Retirement System (PARS), a 401(a) tax-qualified multiple employer trust. CalOptima contributes to this on each employee\u2019s behalf. All contributions are automatically invested in a life-cycle mutual fund based on your current age and is managed by John Hancock Retirement Services. These life-cycle funds are professionally managed investments that automatically adjust to become more conservative over time as you approach your retirement date. If you wish to manage your own investments, you have the ability to select among 20 different mutual funds representing different investment sectors.\nA voluntary 457 Deferred Compensation Plan is also offered. Section 457 plans are available to public agencies and are similar to 401(k) plans in the private sector. The employee determines the amount of pay they wish to contribute, via payroll deductions, on a pre-tax basis. The employee determines from a selection of options how their money will be invested.

{"text": "Fresh food is so attractive to astronauts that they toasted with salad when they were able to cultivate a few lettuce heads on the International Space Station three years ago.\nIn 2021, beans are on the menu to be grown in space, planted in high-tech planters developed at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).\n\u201cAstronauts like gardening and everything that reminds them of life on earth. They enjoy tending and watering the vegetables, and getting them to germinate,\u201d says Silje Wolff, a plant physiologist at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Space (CIRiS), which is part of NTNU Social Research.\nWolff has just completed an experiment that involved growing lettuce for space. The lettuce was planted in artificial soil made from lava rock. The goal is for the plants to grow directly in water that is supplemented with plant nutrients.\n\u201cThe dream of every astronaut is to be able to eat fresh food \u2013 like strawberries, cherry tomatoes or anything that\u2019s really flavorful. Someday that will certainly be possible. We envision a greenhouse with several varieties of vegetables,\u201d says Wolff.\nThe longest stays at the International Space Station have been six months. People travelling to Mars will need to be prepared to stay in space for at least a year.\nThe European Space Agency plans to build a lunar base in 2030 as a stopover on the way to Mars. NASA plans to fly directly to the planet with a target landing date of 2030.\n\u201cThe way space travel works today, it\u2019s almost impossible to take along all the resources you need. That\u2019s why we have to develop a biological system so astronauts can produce their own food, and recycle all of the resources,\u201d says Wolff.\nToday\u2019s astronauts eat only freeze-dried and vacuum-packed foods.\n\u201cAstronauts struggle with having little appetite. They often lose weight. Addressing the psychological aspect of eating something fresh is one of our goals. Vacuum-packed food doesn\u2019t really remind you of food. Having something fresh that triggers the appetite and the right receptors in the brain is important,\u201d Wolff says.\nNTNU and CIRiS are collaborating with Italian and French researchers in their quest to cultivate plant-based food for long space journeys.\nCIRiS tests the new equipment made by NTNU\u2019s technical workshop \u2013 very sophisticated planters that regulate all the water, nutrients, gas and air the plants need. In space, all the water and food has to be recovered. This means that plant fertilization needs to be as precise as possible.\nWolff has conducted experiments in climate-regulated growth chambers in the Netherlands as one aspect of this research.\nOf all the nutrients plants use, they use nitrogen the most. During her experiments, Wolff looked at different nutrient doses and how they affected the plants\u2019 water uptake.\n\u201cWe found that plants can, in a way, \u2018smell\u2019 the amount of nutrients available to them. When the nitrogen concentration is very low, the plant will absorb more water and thus more nitrogen until it reaches an optimal level. The plant has a mechanism that turns on when the nitrogen level is adequate. Then it adjusts both nitrogen and water absorption down,\u201d says Wolff.\nEverything that can be tested on Earth has now been carried out. The next step is to grow beans in space to observe the effect of no gravity on plants\u2019 ability to transport water and absorb nutrients. Simulating the absence of gravity can\u2019t be done on Earth.\nThe beans are placed in a centrifuge to sprout and grow in the space station. The centrifuge is rotated to create different amounts of gravity.\nThat will allow her to compare how the different gravitational levels affect the plants in space. On Earth, gravity causes warm air to rise while cold air sinks. In the space station, air is more stationary, causing astronauts to always have a low-grade fever. Plants are also affected.\n\u201cStationary air affects a layer on the underside of the leaf where the stoma pores are located. When gravity disappears, the boundary layer in the slit-shaped apertures thickens. This reduces evaporation and causes the leaf temperature to increase. Water vapour diffusion to the environment is an important part of plant regulation and can be compared with sweating to cool the body in humans and animals,\u201d says Wolff.\nFood production in cities offers an opportunity to produce more food in the most sustainable way. Cities don\u2019t have much soil for cultivation, but a lot becomes possible if you can plant directly in water in indoor closed systems where all aspects of the climate are regulated.\n\u201cRecycling and precise fertilization are key to achieving more sustainable food production. By growing plants directly in water with dissolved nutrients, fertilization and irrigation are much easier to control,\u201d says Wolff.\n\u201cThe plants become less sensitive to nutritional deficiency because the roots are in direct contact with the nutrients. They\u2019re always able to access new nutrients through the water, and can use absolutely all the nutrients available \u2013 unlike with soil that binds the nutrients and affects their availability to the roots. And the roots don\u2019t rot when the water is mixed with a little oxygen,\u201d she says.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T20:56:47Z", "url": "https://scientificinquirer.com/2019/04/09/salads-in-space-are-as-good-as-gold/?shared=email&msg=fail", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "When we hear the word patience, we probably think of the virtue that enables us to wait. That\u2019s one way of looking at it, but Spirit-led patience is also much more. Patience is longsuffering. It involves more than passive waiting; it is active forbearance. It is a deliberate willingness to put up with disagreeable things in pursuit of higher goals.\nThe best example of patience in the Bible is God himself. A number of times, God is described as being \u201cslow to anger\u201d (see Exodus 34:6; Psalm 103:8). This phrase captures what true patience is. Patient people do more than just wait. They actively restrain their rightful anger and frustration. For a higher purpose, they put up with things that they know are wrong.\nThis is the attitude our longsuffering God has toward sinful people. For Paul, the \u201cimmense patience\u201d of Jesus meant that God put up with all his wickedness for a long time before showing mercy to him. Paul calls himself \u201cthe worst of sinners,\u201d reflecting back on the time of his life when he persecuted Christians (see Acts 7:54-8:3). But God had other plans for Paul (Acts 9:1-31; 13:1-28:31). That could easily be the testimony of every believer.\nHow wonderful that God\u2019s love rests on his own capacity for goodness, and not our own!\nDear Lord, thank you for being patient with us. Forgive us for all we do wrong, and help us to be living testimonies of your mercy.

{"text": "According to a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there has been a recent increase in food allergies among US children ages 18 and below. The data suggests that kid\u2019s food allergies have increased from 3.4% in 1997 to 5.1% by 2011. Skin allergies increased from 7.4 percent to 12.5 percent in that same time span.\nResults from the CDC survey indicate that African American children are more prone to skin allergies when compared to Caucasians. On the other hand, the latter have a higher risk of developing respiratory diseases. Children of Latin American descent have the smallest chances of developing skin reactions when compared to many other races.\nStudies also revealed that the income level of the family is an influential factor. Though there is no known cause for the correlation between income and allergies, researchers have speculated that differences in diet and frequency of antibiotic use could be factors. It is also possible that allergies are simply reported more frequently by affluent families who tend to visit the doctor more often.\nIn further findings, children ages 5 or less are more likely to develop skin allergies when compared to children over 5 years of age. Statistics also revealed that older children are more prone to respiratory problems.\nIn spite of this increase in children\u2019s allergies, there is hope.

{"text": "This DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-inhalation) and after correction for difference in exposure conditions and between respiratory rates under standard conditions and under conditions of light activity (1/0.38 m3/kg x 7d/5d x 6.7 m3/10 m3).\nThis DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-dermal) and after correction for difference in absorption and in exposure conditions (50%/5% x 7d/5d). The oral and dermal absorptions are estimated to be 50 and 5% respectively.\nOccupational exposure limits (8-h time weighted average) of 10 ppm (49 mg/m3) have been adopted in Austria and Germany (DFG) or of 25 ppm (125 mg/m3) in Belgium, Denmark and Great Britain. Short-term OEL of 10 ppm is in force in Austria, of 20 ppm in Germany (DFG) and of 25 ppm in Denmark, France, Spain, Sweden and UK.\n\u201cCarcinogenicity studies with hexylene glycol are not available. However, the genotoxicity studies provide no evidence of a carcinogenic potential. In animal studies of limited validity, 40 mg/kg body weight and day was found to be the NOEL for systemic toxicity after oral administration of the substance. The critical effect of hexylene glycol, however, is the eye irritation, which was observed in animals treated with the undiluted substance. Hexylene glycol does not seem to be a very powerful eye irritant as 25 % solutions were not irritating. In an early study, eye irritation developed in most of the 12 male and female test persons exposed for 15 minutes to hexylene glycol vapour in a concentration of 50 ppm (approximately equivalent to the saturation concentration at 25\u00b0C). No NOEL was determined in this study. The eye irritation seems not to have been very severe, a fact which is also suggested by the steepness of the dose-response curve seen in the Draize test data. The MAK value was established provisionally at 10 ml/m3. Because the eye irritation was not severe, for the restriction of exposure peaks hexylene glycol was classified in Peak limitation category I with an excursion factor of 2. Then, even during the permissible peak concentrations up to 20 ml/m3, no marked irritation is expected. Because of the lack of adequate data for the irritant potential of hexylene glycol, the MAK value must be considered provisional and requires confirmation in further studies. Assuming that 100 % of the inhaled substance is absorbed, exposure to concentrations in the range of the MAK value could result in a daily dose of 7.5 mg/kg body weight which is still below the NOEL determined in animal studies with oral administration, assuming 100 % absorption here too. As there are no reproductive toxicity studies, hexylene glycol is listed in Section II of the List of MAK and BAT Values. The sensitizing potential is low and so the substance is not designated with an \"Sh\". The solubility of the substance suggests that it would be readily absorbed through the skin, but as the toxicity after repeated dermal application to experimental animals is low, the substance is not designated with an \"H\"\u201d.\nThis DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-inhalation x 1/1.15 m3/kg).

{"text": "Tom Coolen has coached a lot of teams in his 58 years.\nHis career has spanned seven countries and 25 years. He\u2019s spent thousands of hours in rinks with teenagers in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, to grizzled pros in Europe.\nAnd he knows how to win.\nDuring the 1992-93 season, he led the Acadia University men\u2019s hockey team to the Canadian Interuniversity Sport national championship at the storied Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto.\nBut nothing compared to what he felt on Feb. 26 of this year.\nOn that day, Coolen helped lead the St. Thomas University men\u2019s volleyball team to the Atlantic Colleges Athletic Association championship as co-coach.\nSTU was the underdog in the match against Holland College, as a team made up of mostly first-year players taking on the top-ranked team.\nThe team moved on to the Canadian Colleges Athletic Association national championships. They finished last in the tournament of eight teams last weekend, outmatched against squads from Ontario and Quebec.\nBut for a team that sat out last season due to a hazing suspension and had to rebuild from scratch, an ACAA championship was more than what anyone could have expected.\n\u201cWith the team being [suspended], I looked at it that we were a new team and this was a fresh start. It was a new beginning to the program.\nIt was that attitude, along with his winning reputation, that brought a professional hockey coach to STU to co-coach a rookie team of volleyball players.\nCoolen grew up in Halifax and played baseball in the Canada Games. After that, he went on to an Atlantic University Sport football career.\nBut hockey is the sport that has taken up much of his life.\nWith a desire to keep playing in some form, Coolen started his hockey coaching career as an assistant coach with the University of New Brunswick men\u2019s hockey team, then called the Red Devils, in 1982-83.\nCoaching took him all over the world, from the U.S. college circuit to Switzerland and Germany.\nBut his credentials go beyond the rink.\nWith master\u2019s degrees in athletic coaching and counselling, Coolen is one of only two people in the province certified by the Canadian Sports Psychology Association.\nHe now splits his time scouting major junior games for NHL Central Scouting and teaching at a school in Doaktown, N.B.\nLast fall, he met with STU athletics director Mike Eagles to talk about rebuilding the men\u2019s volleyball program. Eagles was interested in seeing if Coolen\u2019s son, Patrick, would play for STU.\nHe also wanted to see if Coolen would guide the team with rookie co-coach Francis Duguay.\n\u201cHe felt I had a lot of success as a university coach. I think he felt that would be a good place to start.\n\u201cI was familiar with the volleyball, that age level of kids entering university because I had been involved with the under-18 team [as] general manager.\nThey decided Duguay would handle the on-court coaching and run practices, while Coolen would handle the administrative side and provide general guidance on things like how to handle players.\nAs the season wore on, Coolen helped focus and motivate the young team.\nAt Christmas, the team added Coolen\u2019s son, Patrick, and veteran Andrew Keddy to the team. The libero and setter would be important keys to winning the championship, logging big minutes during the ACAA weekend.\nIn addition to having talent, Coolen knew the key to the team\u2019s success would be taking the program seriously.\nThe week before the championship weekend, Coolen used his sports psychology training to help the team get ready physically and mentally for the challenge ahead of them, starting with practicing at 100 per cent every day. He believes you play how you practice.\nMuch of the roster can play at least another three years at STU if they want to, but Coolen isn\u2019t sure he\u2019ll be there to guide them next season.\n\u201cI came in to establish it and get it started.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T12:31:28Z", "url": "http://theaquinian.net/coaching-is-coaching-from-pros-to-rookies/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Applied CSR24 is the industry's first online customer self-service software that connects your customers to information in your management system, so you can service your customers when and how they want.\n\"Applied CSR24 is an innovative tool\"\nI love that Applied CSR24 integrates the client right into the system. The client is able to get real time details, information, and action on their account. This tool really projects an agency into the innovative world. With everyone, especially younger people, going to their smartphones to get things done, having Applied CSR24 really integrates your agency into their lives.\nAs with anything new, this program will need tweaks and adjustments. But overall it is off to a fantastic start. Applied is great with implementing new ideas, suggestions, and improvements on a regular basis.\nI would 100% recommend this product to you. Even though it is not perfect, Applied is constantly taking feedback and improving this tool. With the way people do business in the world, CSR24 is honestly a fantastic tool to take your agency to the next level.\nUsing CSR24, your agency will profit by having a tool for the client to use directly. Instead of having a person take a phone call, email, or request directly from the insured. The client can go into CSR24 and request a change, download a policy, and do so many things that the live CSR would usually do. With every improvement made to CSR24, it is less that your employees will have to do in the office.\n\"Great product for clients- convenient for Applied users\"\nThe client interface is very easy to navigate and requires minimal training. The ease of renewing certificates is also a useful component- especially when it comes to emailing them out of CSR24.\nNot enough integration with Applied Epic- would be useful to have information loaded into CSR24 to transfer back into Epic the way it does the other direction. Some other little tweaks I'd make, but overall, does a great job at file transmission to clients and giving them COI issuing capabilities.\nThis solves the issue of policy transmission via email- instead of having to send encrypted emails (which everyone hates) we are able to send those documents through a secure server. It will end up saving CSRs time at renewal of certificates as well. It's given us the added benefit of saving paper also- emailing more and more certificates and mailing less.\nWhat Other Insurance solution do you use?\n\"Is a great way for your insureds to access material on their own without you. It is a huge timesaver\"\nI love how the insureds can go on and print a certificate themselves. This really helps with bigger accounts that need a certificate everyday. It helps save time and the insured like it because they have some control themselves. They can also see there polices, auto ID cards, and more!\nIt is kind of complicated to figure out at first. It is not the easier system to use. I believe the software itself can be easier to understand and easier to use, for the insured and the agency.\nI would recommend this product. Again, it saves so much time and the insurer really likes being able to go in when they want to look at something.\nIt really saves with time, which is super important to us. We get a lot loss phone calls on easy stuff like certificates and we can spend more time on helping other customers and quoting more.\n\"Decent program for COI needs\"\nI like that the customer is able to request COI's. I also enjoy the fact that previous COI's and holders are easily accessible and easily changed. It is great being able to send a certificate by fax or email right from the system. No more having to save the document and them email. You can get it done in one swoop. Pretty user friendly as well.\nI dislike having to set up an evidence from the start, There are many components that have to be manually entered, which can be time consuming.\nI am solving the issue of having multiple certificate requests to complete and being able to easily complete them and send them by fax or email without having to leave my desk.\nI dislike the user friendliness. Includes a good amount of extra steps in creating evidences and certificates.\nWork on user friendliness and elimination of steps.\nWe are solving how we issue and request certificates and evidences.\nI absolutely love CSR24. It has made life so much easier!\nI dislike the delay in dropping files in Applied and them appearing in CSR24.\n\"Awesome Syatem for issuing COI\u2019s\"\nAllows clients to issue coi\u2019s if need be. Also renewal of coi\u2019s are a breeze.\nNeeds detailed training to run not easy to use without any training.\nSends renewal coi\u2019s out electronicslly wirh fax or email address therefore saving postage.\n* We monitor all Applied CSR24 reviews to prevent fraudulent reviews and keep review quality high. We do not post reviews by company employees or direct competitors. Validated reviews require the user to submit a screenshot of the product containing their user ID, in order to verify a user is an actual user of the product.\nHi there!

{"text": "1) The development of screw conveyor can be divided into two process, shaft type auger conveyor and shaftless type auger conveyor.\na. Shaft type auger conveyor consists of screw, U type trough, cover plate, inlet, outlet and drive device, which has three types of installation mode, horizontal, inclined and vertical mounting.\nb. Shaftless type auger conveyor uses shaftless spiral blade to replace screw, and U type trough is equipped with replaceable lining. The structure of shaftless type auger conveyor is simple, the material is fed into inlet and moving towards outlet by spiral blades. The whole conveying process is made in a fully closed trough.\n2) GX type auger conveyor is appeared in early phase of screw conveyor and is the earliest universal equipment in China. It mainly transports powdery, granular and small lumpy material, and is not suitable to convey perishable, viscous, easily caked and large chunks of material, because these material are easy to bond on the spiral blades, or block at the position of hanger bearing, which will cause inconvenience to the transportation process. The advantages of GX screw conveyor are energy-saving, low consumption, dust prevention, good sealing, low noise, well-adapted, easy operation and maintenance, flexible arrangement of the positions of inlet and outlet. The disadvantages are huge power consumption, quick wearing of conveyor parts, serious material crushing in the transportation process.\n3) LS type auger conveyor is new generation of screw conveyor, which is designed and improved on the basis of GX type auger conveyor. The advantages are novel structure, reliable performance, advanced technology, wide range of application, significant energy saving and consumption reducing.\n1) Large capacity, high speed and long service life.\n2) Low energy consumption. Most of the energy for screw conveyor is spent on abrasion.\n3) Intelligent development. The future auger conveyor should be closely connected with computer. It will be suitable for program control and intelligent operation. The material handling, equipment installation and maintenance should be intelligent management.\n4) Screw conveyor can be curved transportation.\n5) Combined, compound and large-scale transportation mode. Screw conveyors are co-used with various kinds of continuous conveying equipments to finish complicated material handling. Large-scale transportation includes large capacity, the length of single conveyor and high angle conveying, etc.\n6) To expand the scope of application. At present, the usage range of auger conveyor is restricted. The scope of application should be expanded, to design the auger conveyors that can be operated in corrosive, radioactive, flammable material environment in the condition of high and low temperatures, as well as the conveyors which can transport molten, explosive, easily coking and viscous materials.\n7) To design auger conveyor using environmental awareness, and reduce the pollution to achieve the goal of green design.\nPK Machinery is a professional manufacturer of vibrating screen, screw conveyor, belt conveyor, bucket elevator and scraper conveyor, further information, please click:www.pkmachinery.com.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T16:06:59Z", "url": "https://www.pkmachinery.com/faq/development-history-and-trend-of-screw-conveyor.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Laid back and badass, featuring vintage glass cabochons and my signature handmade silver roses.\nPlease excuse the somewhat gnarly hands in the photos--those are the hands that make the jewelry. :) Most items are made to order, so please allow three to five business days before they ship.\nThough you won't receive the exact item pictured, it will be the same design.

I collect things. I have a lot of cats.\nI graduated in 2008 from the University of Kansas with a degree in jewelry design and metalsmithing. Fun fact: It\u2019s the oldest program of its kind west of the Mississippi. I read that in the course catalog once and I\u2019ve repeated it dozens of times. I will probably continue to do so.\nYou know how most people change their major at least once? I never did. Kinda surprising, especially when you consider that a) I didn't take a single art class in high school and b) I picked jewelry/metalsmithing from a list on the back of a postcard KU sent me. My last semester, I took a letterpress class and made my own graduation announcements. On the back is a quote from Marilyn da Silva which reads, \"Some people are said to have been born with a silver spoon. I am convinced that I was born with the hammer, to make the silver spoon, which makes me even luckier.\" Pure, Grade A awesomeness right there, folks.\nI've been a maker my entire life. My mom's mom taught her to sew and my mom taught me. I joined 4-H when I was old enough and made clothes for the fair each year. It's kind of mind-blowing that I've been sewing for over twenty years. My dad was always working on our family home, which originally belonged to his grandmother. From the two of them, I learned how to do it myself before DIY was even a \"thing\". :) When I was a freshman in high school, I was bound and determined to take woodworking instead of Spanish, despite the reservations of my high school counselor. I later took Spanish, but woodworking has proven to be the most helpful in my daily life, hands down.\nIf you've got the time or interest, here's a blog post featuring my wedding a couple years ago: http://emmalinebride.com/real-weddings/handmade-wedding-diy-details/ I made my dress, the bridesmaids' dresses, my husband's clothes, our jewelry, invites... It was a crazy, crazy time in my life and called upon nearly every skill I have. Ha ha.\nMy parents have taken me to flea markets since I was little, so I've had a lifelong appreciation of old things. I especially take inspiration from vintage western imagery as well as Victorian jewelry and symbolism. You'll see a lot of \"lucky\" symbols...hence my shop name. I am obsessed with horseshoes but I don\u2019t like horses all that much. One chewed on my ponytail at 4-H camp and I\u2019ve never fully forgiven the species.\nMany of my pieces showcase vintage glass cabochons. Most of them are what\u2019s called a \u201creverse intaglio.\u201d The cabochons have a design molded into the back, which is then painted. They're a poor man's version of Essex crystals, some of which are incredible. Google it. You won't regret it.\nI recycle whatever I can, in and out of the studio. Your purchase might be mailed in a reused bubble envelope and padded with tissue paper. The gift box itself will be new, but is made of 77% post-consumer fiber.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T16:11:28Z", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/shop/luckstruck", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "This comment was posted to reddit on Jul 10, 2018 at 10:59 am and was deleted within 15 minutes.\nI dont have any midi to cv modules but i figured out that i could use my Minibrute as a sort of bridge between my DAW and my Eurorack. All i had to do was connect my minibrute to my daw (via usb) and it reads as a midi device. I then sent the midi sequence i wrote in my DAW to the minibrute which automatically converts it to cv/oct and gate outputs for my eurorack.\nI used the MI Braids as my sound source for all 3 sequence patches and recorded them one by one(the viola bass patch is what is being played live). I used a lil bit of a sine wave lfo for the flute/clarinet patches to give the tremolo sound that those instruments naturally have. I also used some low pass filtering and fx processing with all 3 tracks.\nAnyways, hope you dig it!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T15:46:18Z", "url": "https://www.resavr.com/comment/switched-on-dvorak-my-10739093", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "When we went to the beach a few weeks ago, Kate and Lexi had their first surf lesson.\nThey have been interested in surfing for a long time and dreamed of having a chance to try it for themselves. Most people in Memphis and Birmingham go to the Gulf when they go to the beach, but we always go to the Atlantic with my family. I figured we should take advantage of the upside of the longer drive and give them a little something to remember. It started with a long walk to the beach, carrying their boards.\nThey patiently learned all the things you need to learn on the beach. They did safety exercises and practiced good posture. They tried a few things from just a few yards out, getting a feel for the board under their feet. Then we watched as the instructor led them out far from the shore.\nThen there are the few seconds you have to find your balance as you try to get on your feet. I wish you could see the delight on Kate\u2019s face when she realized she was really surfing.\nTrying new things is not easy. Watching Kate and Lexi learn to surf was thrilling and frightening and humbling all at once.\nThe whole experience made me start thinking about this latest round of job hunting. It\u2019s hard to put myself out there and be willing to fail. But like a child who dreams of catching a wave and popping up onto her feet, I must be prepared to fall and to let the waves beat me. Only then will I know the true delight of doing what I only hoped I could. Thankful for these two, parenting them is a constant education.\nHappy Birthday to Lexi who is SEVEN today! She is full of life and navigates all kinds of situations with ease: diligent in the classroom, tenacious on the soccer field, fun with friends. I am proud to be her mom.\nWhat was the best thing about being 6? Starting first grade.\nWhat are you most proud of learning? How to do cartwheels.\nWhat was the best book you read? The one I am reading right now, Absolutely Lucy by Ilene Cooper.\nWhat is your favorite song? I like too many to choose.\nWhat is your favorite tv show? Shake it Up!\nWhat are you looking forward to about being 7? Going to the beach on vacation.\nWhat college do you want to go to? I\u2019m only seven, Mom.\nDo you think you\u2019ll get married when you grow up? Have any kids? Yes, I think I\u2019ll get married and have one kid.\nWhat do you want to be when you grow up? A rockstar when I am a teenager and a veterinarian when I am an adult.\nI\u2019ve been applying for jobs for a while. Applying for jobs is one of the anxiety-producing, dehumanizing and frustrating things I have ever encountered. Every single job application is an opportunity to feel like fourth grade kickball \u2014 never picked first.\nI woke up this morning, ate a bowl of cereal, drank some coffee and culled through emails. Then I started through my list of job seeking websites. All of the sudden, I had a feeling deep in my bones. If I don\u2019t try, I am already rejected. I\u2019m on a roller coaster that only goes up. Instead of feeling like I was opening myself up for rejection, I felt like I was opening myself up to new opportunities.\nIt has been refreshing and lovely. Hoping this feeling sticks around for a little while.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T14:52:22Z", "url": "http://www.thisclassicallife.com/?cat=2", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "CLEMSON, S.C. \u2014 Jaron Blossomgame scored a season-high 29 points to lead Clemson to a 93-65 victory over SC State on Tuesday, the Tigers\u2019 fifth straight win, all at home. Blossomgame moved into the top 20 in Clemson history in career scoring, surpassing 1,300 points. Clemson moved to 7-2 with the win, while SC State dropped to 2-8 overall. In all, the Tigers had four scorers in double figures, including Shelton Mitchell (14), Donte Grantham (13) and Avry Holmes (10). The Tigers had just two turnovers for the game, the second-lowest figure in program history. Clemson had 17 assists on 36 baskets and outscored the Bulldogs by a whopping 52-28 margin in the paint. Blossomgame provided early energy, going upstairs to land a couple of high-flying alleyoops. He posted 15 of his points before intermission, helping Clemson to a lead of as many as 13 in the opening frame. The Tigers saw SC State hang around, as the Bulldogs converted 50 percent of their field goal attempts in the opening 20 minutes of play. Clemson stretched its second-half advantage to 20 for the first time when Grantham emphatically followed a Holmes miss, throwing down a one-handed slam to bring the crowd to its feet. The Tigers take to the road against a pair of SEC foes, playing Alabama on Sunday, Dec. 18 in Birmingham, before facing rival South Carolina three days later in Columbia.\n\u201cThis was a really good offensive performance. Certainly, having 17 assists and only two turnovers were big stats, as well as the 23 offensive rebounds. We knew, especially when they played small, that we could hurt them inside.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T08:37:27Z", "url": "https://clemsontigers.com/tigers-ease-past-sc-state-93-65/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Because I am often recognized at the stores, people always ask me questions. I am more than happy to help. However, when I have to tell someone their doing something \"Wrong\" I feel bad. I had to deal with that yesterday.\nFirst of all, I was asked if there was a way to read the coupon bar code to see if they can use it on other products than what it was intended for. I answered \"No, I don't teach that practice\". Then I was informed that a customer in the store told them about it and was doing it regularly. I was a little upset about this. Practices like that is the reason stores are tightening up their coupon policies and making it harder for us to get great deals.\nSimply put, it is deciphering the bar code on a coupon to see if it will work on different (preferably less expensive) items.\nLook at coupon barcode decoding this way: It is like using counterfeit money to pay for your purchase! Although the cashier may not notice you are paying with a counterfeit bill, it will eventually reveal itself and the store looses out. A coupon is a form of payment and by not getting what the coupon says it is for is the same as paying with counterfeit money.\nSo, please read your coupons, get exactly what it says it is for and follow the parameters given by the coupon. Please don't use the barcode to determine what you can get because you know the register won't beep. Just because the register does not beep, does not mean that it is OK.\nThere are plenty of other websites and blogs that teach this practice and believe that it is OK. Please Be Aware! They believe they are right and have no problem teaching others to do the same. Taking advantage of a glitch in the bar code to get around the text of the coupon is fraud.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T04:41:20Z", "url": "http://couponkeri.blogspot.com/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Lately there\u2019s been a lot of fuss about Social Media. There are conferences dedicated to it (such as SMX Social) and different aspects of if (such as the upcoming Blog World Expo). There are blogs dedicated to it such as Pete Cashmore\u2019s Mashable, and there are portions of forums dedicated it to it as well like on Cre8asite Forums. All of these talk about Social Media and their individual parts, however it\u2019s rare that any of these actually talk about incorporating Social Media as part of an overall strategy for online marketing.\nTo look as Social Media as a boost for you SEO, quite frankly, is foolish. Social Media touches so many other aspects of an online marketing strategy. It isn\u2019t just about gaining links to raise your PR or even your ranking in the results on Google, Yahoo, Live or Ask. If that is the sole reason to use social media, you might want to start thinking about finding another \u201cquick fix\u201d. Soon enough, the search engines will probably take a hard look at the effect of social media and will start devaluing the power links from places like Digg have (there are some reports that this has already begun to happen).\nSo if the search engines start devaluing the links from these big well known social media hubs like Digg, Reddit, and StumbleUpon, what is and SEO to do. Well if you are just and \u201cSEO\u201d and not an online marketer, it\u2019s off to make sure that website is fully optimized. If you are an online marketer, you probably have already seen the value beyond SEO for Social Media.\nBeyond the mass amount of links that a successful social media campaign can provide there are several other areas that Social Media touches within an internet marketing strategy.\nPPC \u2013 When Social Media is strategically combined with PPC it can effectively reduce the cost of some campaigns. If you are advertising in the content network, utilizing social media can help you cut back on some of those costs. It\u2019s a matter of watching your analytics closely in this case, as Social Media is not a replacement for PPC, it can certainly help to reduce some of the costs.\nBranding \u2013 Social Media is a great place to work with branding measures. If your company is new, and you need to get the word out in a cheap, efficient way, social media is the place to start. Talking to your audience, participating in a niche community, speaking to people who are already interesting in the type of product or service your offer all are a great way to get the conversation started.\nThe list above demonstrates just a few ways that shows Social Media isn\u2019t just a stand alone strategy. It needs to be worked into an full online marketing plan if you want to have the successful results you are hoping for. Understanding how every aspect interrelates is just as important with social media as it is with working PPC and SEO together. Having an experienced online marketer who understands all aspects is going to be key to your strategy, the last thing you want to do is leave this in the hands of an intern. So take the time and not only plan, but budget for social media, make it a part of the strategy all on its own, not just a part of SEO.\nThis entry was posted in Social Media and tagged marketing plan, Online Marketing, online plans, Social Media, strategies, strategy by Liana \"Li\" Evans.

{"text": "Becoming a parent is supposed to be one of the most exciting and happiest days in one\u2019s life. But as the stories of Serena Williams, Lauren Bloomstein, and many others published over the past year show, the very real threat of complications has made giving birth in America more scary than exciting.\nThe US has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world; in 2015, 26.4 out of every 100,000 live births resulted in maternal mortality. That\u2019s more than three times the rate in Canada, four times the rate in Japan, and nearly five times as high as Australia\u2019s. Further, women in certain states and regions of the US, and especially African American women, face extremely high rates of maternal mortality.\nThe session featured Dr. Carol Sakala, Director of Childbirth Connection Programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families; Nan Strauss, Director of Policy and Advocacy at Every Mother Counts; Dr. Steven Calvin, Medical Director of the Minnesota Birth Center; and Dianna Jolles, faculty at Frontier Nursing University and practitioner at El Rio Community Health Center.\nThe panelists pointed out that both overuse and underuse are prevalent in maternity care. Many women, especially those in rural areas, do not have easy access to maternal care. Additionally, high rates of obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure (which are often untreated) create a greater risk of complications for American mothers.\nBut at the same time, too many unnecessary interventions are being done during childbirth. The rate of cesarean sections in the US is about 32%, much higher than the rate recommended by the World Health Organization. C-section rates also vary widely across states. Why is there so much geographical variation? Diana Jolles explained that whether a mother has a c-section is not always dependent on medical need, but can depend on the hospital or clinic\u2019s access to resources, payer source, and provider practice styles.\nCarol Sakala echoed this point in her presentation of the NPWF \u201cState of the Science\u201d on maternity care. Much of the obstetrics field is focused on the \u201crescue\u201d of high-risk pregnancies, but this misses the chance to prevent complications in the first place, said Sakala. At the same time, we use specialized care for low-risk pregnancies unnecessarily, which can be harmful.\nIn many of the stories of preventable maternal harm or near-harm, there is a prevalent theme of the patient not being heard. There are stories where the patient was highly educated, knew exactly what was wrong, had the same complication before, or even had a medical degree themselves, and doctors still ignored the patient when she insisted that something was wrong.\nOne way to combat this dangerous and frustrating problem is by integrating support from a midwife and doula, said Nan Strauss. Midwives and doulas provide different but complimentary services (midwives are licensed health care providers that provide prenatal, labor, and post-partum support, while doulas provide non-clinical physical and emotional support during birth).\nHaving continuous, one-on-one support from another person is associated with increased likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth, reduced likelihood of a cesarean birth, and reduced negative feelings about childbirth, compared with just having physician care. \u201cThe goal is to put the person at the center of the equation,\u201d said Strauss.\nThe US is lagging behind other countries in maternal care, but several states are taking steps to change that. Recently, governor Andrew Cuomo of New York announced a pilot program allowing Medicaid to reimburse patients for doula services, making New York the third state to expand Medicaid coverage for doulas.\nStuebe and others recently released a statement from a task force of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, urging doctors to make postpartum care an \u201congoing process, rather than a single encounter, with services and support tailored to each woman\u2019s individual needs.\u201d Statements like these are long overdue, as are steps to facilitate continuous support and reduce unnecessary interventions during birth.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T22:55:11Z", "url": "https://lowninstitute.org/news/blog/getting-right-care-maternity-care/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "When it comes to determining total cost of ownership (TCO), it is vital for organisations to be able to place a single value on the complete lifecycle of a capital purchase. In the retail space, this means implementing a robust and repeatable system that enables the business to calculate the TCO of its IT, Logistics and Property investments.\nAs one of South Africa\u2019s largest retailers, the Foschini Group (TFG) found that the size and complexity of its businesses required a particularly robust, granular model to charge back the shared service costs for its various brands.\nThe Foschini Group currently offers an impressive portfolio of 28 retail brands covering clothing and footwear (including brands such as Foschini, Markham, Exact and Due South), jewellery (Sterns, American Swiss, Mat &May), sportswear (Sportscene, and Totalsports) and homeware (@home, @homelivingspace) and retails through over 2 600 stores across sub-Saharan Africa.\nIt was essential for TFG to gain visibility into a more accurate return on capital employed (ROCE) per brand, such as determining Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) after shared services cost allocations for each of the 28 brands, rather than relying on this metric at a consolidated Group level alone, explains Marlize van der Westhuizen, Head of Finance: Infotec and Logistics Divisions at TFG.\n\u201cSince TFG had no real cost transparency solution and a very limited charge-back model to its various brands, the group clearly required not only the right solution, but also the relevant expertise to introduce an effective cost transparency discipline into the enterprise. For this, we turned to Magic Orange, which was able to assist us with both consulting services and the actual implementation of the chosen solution,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe first requirement was to create a complete product and service catalogue, which the Magic Orange team assisted to build from scratch, based on relevant business input from the various areas in scope. Furthermore, the existing models for the allocation of costs were very limited and not consistently based on operational drivers. This meant that every product and service required a driver to be sourced and incorporated into the Magic Orange model. In addition to the development of these drivers, the implementation included training ensuring employees understood both the nature and fairness of the drivers.,\u201d explains Malcolm Stewart, Business Development Manager at Magic Orange.\n\u201cThe first phase focused on the customer\u2019s IT and Logistics budget stack \u2013 an individual stack that nonetheless had a substantial budget. This core model was delivered in a mere eight weeks, despite being driven from a zero base,\u201d Stewart states.\nVan der Westhuizen adds that reciprocal charging was properly modelled and catered for, and fully loaded and accurate TCOs for products and services across the organisation were also made available. Finally, scenario modelling was also implemented, which enabled multiple scenarios, including a range of different budgets, actuals and forecast data, to be loaded. This will assist TFG in making both strategic and tactical decisions.\n\u201cIn the end though, the two biggest game changers for us were the manner in which Magic Orange brought together the cost transparency and a credible recharge model based on consumption of services opposed to just a cost allocation model. This will further assist us in optimizing costs and an important step to calculate ROCE at a brand level. The Magic Orange team fully delivered on our challenges and exceeded our expectation in the way their experts understand and care for our business success,\u201d concludes van der Westhuizen.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T00:58:51Z", "url": "https://www.magicorange.com/2018/09/05/sharing-the-magic-of-cost-transparency/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "A few days before Christmas 2018 I travelled up to Buckinghamshire and the lovely little town of Amersham for Sarah & Neil's wedding at the quaint Kings Chapel, set in the grounds of the larger Kings Arms on the High St. Despite the drizzle and cloud, the couple and their guests were in fine spirits! The main room was decked out with fairy lights and a nice big Christmas tree in the corner, and after the ceremony and confetti throw the staff quickly changed it all around for the speeches and cake cut. Sarah & Neil's first dance was one of the most creative I've seen this year - they had a whole routine worked out and put on quite the show for their guests! Before I left I took the couple back outside for some creative photos in front of the chapel and amongst the fairy lights in the trees. What a fab way to end 2018!\nOne of the great things about being a wedding photographer is it can take you all over the country, and even further afield sometimes! I've been to Buckinghamshire a few times for weddings in the past, and oddly it's always in the colder months of the year. Knowing that the roads would likely be packed with people travelling just before Christmas, I allowed extra time for the 2 hour journey. Sadly as usual the M25 was horrendous and despite the extra time I finally arrived at Kings Chapel in Amersham half an hour after I planned.\nI still had plenty of time before the 4pm ceremony, but I wanted to make the most of the fading natural light and get as much done as possible - even with a bit of drizzle coming down. The ceremony itself was lovely and the room had a nice clean feel - made all the most Christmassy by the big tree in the corner! The confetti tunnel afterwards was great fun and we went straight into the formal photos up on the mezzanine style balcony, along with some of the newlyweds amongst the warm glow of the fairylights.\nThe staff at Kings Chapel quickly turned the ceremony room around, and it really did look beautiful. The speeches were, as always, a bit of an event. Lots of great little stories and anecdotes, and a few tears too. But it was the first dane that really blew my mind! Sarah & Neil kept this a secret but I managed to get it out of Neil with just enough time to set up lights. It was going to be dramatic and I wanted to capture it all in the best way!\nThey launched into a great choreographed number and everyone was in fits of laughter, cheering them both on, before they dragged their children onto the dance floor to join them, as everyone else got involved too. It made for some great photographs, some of my favourites from the day - especially Neil lifting Sarah up into the air and spinning her around!\nJust before I left I wanted to get some more outdoor photos of the two of them, something I don't always get the chance to do at summer weddings as it's often still light outside. The perfect round off to their special day as I headed home to enjoy the festive break. If you've booked Kings Chapel for your wedding in Buckinghamshire, or indeed another venue in the Home Counties or the Southeast in general, I'd love to talk more about your photography plans! Head over to my collections and pricing and if you like my style, get in touch for more information.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T22:20:35Z", "url": "https://www.bymichaelangelo.co.uk/blog/kings-chapel-amersham-wedding-with-sarah-neil", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The Pints & Bikes Tour at Suncadia Resort in northwestern Washington state is a five-mile journey through 6,000 acres of forest land with a pit stop at the Brick Tavern for a flight of local craft beer. Also known as the Brick Saloon, this legendary watering hole was established in 1889 and even has an original 23-foot running water spittoon and a basement jail cell.\n4. Try cider, beer, and cycling in Santa Fe.\nLearn about microbrews and ciders on the Brews Cruise, a 10- to 13-mile bicycle tour through the historic neighborhoods and scenic streets of Santa Fe. Along the way, you\u2019ll meet brewmasters and cider makers and get VIP tours of brewery backrooms. Bring your own bike for a discount on your tour.\n5. Explore Niagara Falls wine country.\nCombine a trip to Niagara Falls with a tasting tour of fine wines in a quiet countryside region. Book a Taste & See tour by Amore di Vino and choose which wineries, breweries, hard cider mills, or distilleries you want to visit. Or take the Discover Niagara shuttle to self-tour near the Niagara Wine Trail. The hop-on/hop-off trolley connects Niagara Falls to Old Fort Niagara. Purchase the Vino Visa Passport ($40) for steep discounts on local lodging, restaurants, and transportation.\n6. Do the Great Pumpkin Beer tour of North Carolina.\nWelcome the fall season Charlie Brown style and hop on the Port City Brew Bus for the Great Pumpkin Beer Tour of Wilmington. Along the way, you\u2019ll sample pumpkin beers and visit local breweries. Earn points through activities like a costume contest, Great Pumpkin trivia, pumpkin carving, and other challenges for the chance to win prizes on this perfect celebration of fall.\n7.

That way, if the two ends don\u2019t come together perfectly, the imperfection will be concealed when propped up and no one will likely see it.\nIn this case, I attached the trim to one inside RIGHT side of one piece of sweater cut. This will make it easier to attache the other piece of sweater because the trim won\u2019t shift as much.\nPin the second sweater cut over the first (right sides together) and stitch around the edge.\nTurn inside out, fold pillow in half and stuff inside the new form and then hand stitch the opening closed.\nI think the faux mink adds just the right amount of fancy-schmancy to this simple sweater pillow project.\nYup, it\u2019s that easy\u2026 and for a fraction of the price you may find at a big retailer.\nSo, start looking around for those sweaters.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T12:31:37Z", "url": "https://celebrate-creativity.com/my_weblog/2015/11/sweater-pillow.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The exhibit will feature the art of three established graffiti artists from two well-known crews: Xplode CBS, Boise CBS, Booh AWR; and collaborative work by Rob Carmona, Naomi Altamirano and Brandon Cisneros.\nGraffiti, originating as an ancient practice of visual communication, exploded in the United States in the early 1970\u2019s.

An exhibit of this nature is especially significant in Orange County since graffiti is scarce here, and \u201cAEROSOL\u201d therefore offers the rare opportunity to see outstanding graffiti art in a local environment. The artists are presenting works that transcend time and space to share the legacy of graffiti from the streets to its impact in design, illustration and experimental art.\nIn addition to traditional media, the gallery is featuring footage of the artist\u2019s creations on walls, in order to commemorate the exciting yet unfortunate aspect of graffiti: its transient nature. The exhibiting artists have been working in this medium from as young as 10 years of age, citing early inspiration from exposure to the urban landscape of Los Angeles, the Cartoon Network, Disney, Atari games, Hip-Hop culture, Punk, anti-authoritarian expressions of free-will, artists ranging from Michelangelo to Salvador Dali, and even fashion, cars and design.

{"text": "India should make a long term investment in ensuring that a Taliban-type of government never comes to power again in Afghanistan.\nTHROUGHOUT THE 1980s and the 1990s, India looked at the developments in Afghanistan with a certain amount of dismay. It could not fathom the former Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. Initially, the policy makers in New Delhi initially tried to find a political way out \u2014 gently persuading the Soviet Union to withdraw. India even offered to work with Pakistan to find a political solution. But Pakistan's Zia-ul-Haq refused to oblige. The Cold War politics practiced by the Great Powers in Afghanistan was too complex for India to intervene effectively.\nAfter the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, India kept a close watch on Islamabad's game plan. New Delhi's moves such as helping Burhanuddin Rabbani met with extremely limited success. Alarm bells began ringing with the Taliban's arrival on the scene in 1994. India saw a link between the developments in Jammu and Kashmir, the Taliban's creation and the way it was consolidating its position in Afghanistan. India's efforts to sensitise the great powers about this development had no success. After the capture of Kabul in September 1996, India closed down its mission there.\nHowever, as a goodwill gesture to the Afghan people and its long-standing relationship with Kabul, India maintained contacts with the Taliban and the Northern Alliance forces and continued humanitarian assistance to both factions.\nThe hijacking of the Indian Airlines flight IC-814 to Kandahar on Christmas-eve in 1999 brought a swift change in India's policy towards the Taliban. By the spring of 2000, Pakistan's game plan of trying to divide Afghanistan on ethnic lines was known in the rest of the neighbourhood \u2014 Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and India were quick to evolve a commonality of interests. India set itself two tasks: not to allow Afghanistan's territorial integrity to be disturbed under any circumstances; and to strengthen the Northern Alliance to fight the Taliban. India then decided to make its presence felt to beef up the forces of the Northern Alliance. Strategically, making the Turkmenistan capital, Dushanbe, a staging post made a lot of sense as it is close to the Northern Alliance stronghold, Panjshir Valley. A field hospital at Farkhar, near Dushanbe, was established in early 2000.\nSimultaneously, the airfields in and around Dushanbe were made operational to ferry equipment to the Northern Alliance. India also began coordinating efforts with the Central Asian Republics. They agreed to be part of the broad front being proposed by India along with Iran. They readily opened their stores of Soviet vintage arms and ammunition and aircraft to the Northern Alliance.\nThis was also the period during which Ahmed Shah Masood made unannounced visits to India, the last being in May 2001, to refine his strategy in combating the Taliban. In his assessment, the Taliban could not last a single day without Pakistan's military support; and India having fought four wars with Pakistan understood the latter's military machine better than anyone.\nThough not conclusively proven, circumstantial evidence shows that the Taliban-Al-Qaeda leadership assumed that eliminating Masood would automatically result in a collapse of the Northern Alliance. In spite of warnings from friendly countries such India, Masood decided to give an interview to an \"Algerian\" television network during which he was killed. That was on September 9, 2001.\nThe Taliban-Al-Qaeda underestimated Masood's vision and foresight. Anticipating an eventuality of this type, he groomed three of his close associates \u2014 Mohammad Fahim, Abdullah Abdullah and Qanooni. The assassination of Masood did dampen spirits to a certain extent. The September 11, 2001, attacks by the Taliban-Al-Qaeda on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon woke the U.S. from its slumber. The triumvirate \u2014 Mr. Qanooni, Mr. Abdullah and Gen. Fahim \u2014 proved brilliant in preparing their forces to synchronise their attacks with that of the U.S. They were also aware that the U.S. was unlikely to seek their help.\nAs late as 2001, one U.S. diplomat in Islamabad dismissed Masood as irrelevant, adding that Washington saw him as part of the problem and not as part of the solution.\"\nAs the U.S. war, Operation Enduring Freedom, started on October 7, 2001, though India extended complete support to it, things did not move the way it expected. One of Afghanistan's neighbours, Iran, was more or less excluded from the alliance; and India's intelligence inputs were seen by the U.S. war-planners through the spectrum of India-Pakistan relations.\nThe Northern Alliance was seen as an appendage of India. The first three weeks of bombing, from October 7 to 28, 2001, produced no tangible results to the U.S. on the ground. The widespread criticism of aimless U.S. bombing and high civilian casualties brought the whole operation under severe criticism. At this point, Indian and Russian intervention made the U.S. war planners see the logic of cooperating with Northern Alliance. In the crucial meeting on October 30, 2001, between the U.S. theatre commander, Gen. Tommy Franks, and the Northern Alliance, an agreement was reached on cooperation between the two. In the subsequent nine days, the Northern Alliance was able to capture Mazar-e-Sharif, and reach the outskirts of Kabul. During this Northern Alliance campaign, nine battalions of the Pakistani armed forces were either decimated or made to flee southwards to safer places. One version of the events was that Pakistani GHQ in Rawalpindi issued orders to its men to rush back to safer places. If this is true, the exodus of so-called Taliban soldiers from Mazar-e-Sharif, Kabul and other areas in early November 2001, as Northern Alliance troops marched in can be attributed to it.\nBy this time everyone associated with the Northern Alliance including the U.S. itself realised what good fighters the Northern Alliance men were and started admiring Masood's vision in training such a formidable force. On November 13, against the protests from Pakistan, Northern Alliance troops entered Kabul. India on the success of its subtle diplomacy immediately announced the reopening of the Embassy in Kabul.\nOn the Government that should come in Kabul after the fall of the Taliban, India and the Afghan neighbourhood (with the exception of Pakistan) had well defined objectives from the beginning \u2014 it should not have any Taliban or any of its allies/friends/sympathisers anywhere near the corridors of power.\nThough some of the extra regional powers and Pakistan try to make the Taliban movement synonymous with the Pashtuns, India always refused to buy this theory. In fact, the Indian debate during that period was that there were lots of groups among the Pashtuns who opposed the Taliban from the beginning. Instead of looking at Afghanistan through the spectrum of ethnicity, all the forces that opposed the Taliban-type of rule should be in the new Government; it should be as broad-based as possible.\nThis concern remains even now. India should make a long term investment in ensuring that a Taliban-type of government never comes to power again in Afghanistan.

{"text": "Installed over 200+ 7450's with ip phones and cameras connected to switches. Currently we have several that are \"working\" sort of. Essentially POE is working great until I had to replace a camera the other day. Put new one up plugged in no POE, Tested with a Fluke Tester no POE, so I was like weird I guess I'll reboot the stack pull power and maybe that will fix it. Used CLI to check config on port 1/1/8 everything was good enabled and inline power. Still was not working and still not working to this day trying to figure out if there is a POE defect that needs to be updated to fix. It is all ports on the switch not just 2/1/6, 7 ,8. I unplugged a working device and then plugged back in and it would also not come back online with POE. We are using LLDP as well.\nHere is running config of stack with issue and poe details.\nThanks in advance for any help that anyone can give.\nI'm unclear on the steps you've taken so far. Did you try to disable and re-enable inline power on the port? When I've had inconsistent behavior with PoE ports, I'll disable the port, disable inline power to the port, re-enable the port, and re-enable inline power to the port. And usually that fixes the issue unless the hardware itself failed.\nAlso try another port that you know is working.\nAs mentioned above, show inline power would be helpful.\nYes to all of the above troubleshooting steps.\nPower Capacity: Total is 1496000 mWatts. Current Free is 1082046 mWatts.\nPower Capacity: Total is 1496000 mWatts. Current Free is 1158111 mWatts.\nAs for other troubleshooting steps we have reloaded the switch stack, pulled power from switches, moved to a working poe port and the port we move to also will not work even when plugging back in the old device that was currently working. The only thing I have not tried is to update the poe firmware to a newer version.\nAnd I asked tech support to get in touch, after I released your post from possible SPAM folder due to the length of your config. Case 794153 is your ticket with Ruckus. I'll keep this thread open if you don't mind sharing a 'show inline power' output please?\nIt seems like it is the first 8 ports but I can confirm plugging into port 10 >> on it would not power the device i get a link from my tester and no power though. resetting the switch usually fixes the issue but this time it didn't. Our current firmware does not allow that command to try it we would need to update our switches in this closet to test this. Thanks for the input Larry.\nI would strongly suggest taking a patch, there have been a few POE fixes since 8030h, 8030q is now available.\nHi, I faced same issue before. It was PoE firmware issue which you are using 01.6.7 Build 013.\nI solved it by upgrading 1.8.8.b001.

{"text": "Hacienda Heights is an unincorporated community in Los Angeles County which gained its current name in 1962 due to the community being centered around Hacienda Boulevard, prior to this the area was known as North Whittier Heights (after its southern neighbor) with the area south of Clark Ave., known as Hillgrove (the now defunct elementary School, Hillgrove Elementary is named after this community).\nAfter purchasing the 1,826 acre tract of land, Hart and Torrance planted Citrus (primarily oranges) and avocado groves, and a small community sprung up around its packing mills. Eventually the area transformed from a small agricultural town to a large bedroom community during the 1940s, gaining speed in the 1950s and finally hitting its maximum growth in the early 1970s. Most residents work elsewhere in the greater Los Angeles County area, and although there have been multiple attempts to incorporate or merge with La Puente or Whittier, these attempts have all failed up to this point.\nHacienda Heights has a new community Center, built in the old location of Hillgrove Elementary School (which is was of the oldest elementary schools in Hacienda Heights).\nThe Community Center opened October 25, 2014.\nWith a large multipurpose room and performance center. This venue can be used for performances, wedding receptions, anniversary parties, community group meetings and seminars.\nThis community center includes \"Circles of a Ripple\" by artist James Dinh, creating a gathering place for visitors of the community center and park.\n\u2022\tThe highest point in Hacienda Heights is found in the Puente Hills (which are relatively geologically new), which is Workman Hill, elevation 1,388 feet (423 meters), just southeast of Turnbull Canyon Road and Skyline Drive.\n\u2022\tHacienda Heights (as measured from the center) is 11 statute miles (by air) from Disneyland (Anaheim). This makes Anaheim the closest large city (over 250,000) to Hacienda Heights.\n\u2022\tHacienda Heights is situated next to the relatively newly discovered Puente Hills Fault Line (which is the fault on which the 5.9, 1987 Whittier Narrows Earthquake took place on). This fault runs from Northern Orange County to just under downtown Los Angeles.\n\u2022\tThe Puente Hills are still new (geologically speaking) with the roots of these hills existing somewhere far off the west coast of the ancestral continent of North America. The uplift of the Puente Hills is the result of the Pacific Plate and its parallel movement to the northwest along the North American Plate, Evidence of all three of these subduction events\u2014volcanoes, granite batholiths, and the crustal shavings\u2014are found buried deep beneath the Puente Hills.\n\u2022\tThe Los Angeles basin in which the Puente Hills/Hacienda Heights reside began forming in the late Miocene epoch according to Wright, 1991; Ingersoll and Rumelhart, 1999 (see references at the bottom of this page).\nBasin subsidence at that time was accommodated by large extensional faults including the Puente Hills/Whittier\u2013Elsinore fault system and the Santa Monica fault system.\nIn the mid-Pliocene the relative plate motion between the North American plate and the Pacific plate changed to produce overall north\u2013south compression of the basin. This compression led to the development of a series of blind thrust faults in the young sediments of the Los Angeles basin, including the Puente Hills thrust system.\nThe Coyote Hills, Santa Fe Springs, and Los Angeles faults are the three blind fault segments, with no surface trace, that comprise the Puente Hills thrust system. (See picture above left, please click to enlarge) The potential seismic hazard of these faults to the metropolitan Los Angeles was demonstrated in 1987 when the Santa Fe Springs ruptured in the Magnitude 6.0 Whittier Narrows earthquake. Geologic evidence suggests the Puente Hills thrust system as a whole is capable of generating earthquakes greater than Magnitude 7.0, and has caused four such events over the past 11,000 years.\nPlease do not let this geological information frighten anyone who is thinking of moving to Hacienda Heights, as all areas have their \u201cpotential\u201d issues (such as Tornados in many Midwest locations). My father (who was born in 1932) has lived in the area his whole life and has never suffered a loss from earthquakes.\nI will also add that Hacienda Heights is a beautiful and family friendly community that has more of smaller community feel than a suburb in Los Angeles County and I can state I found it a beautiful community to spend my childhood years.\n* Wright, T.L., 1991.

{"text": "Motor Neuron Disease though most commonly used to mention one specific disease ie Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS), Motor Neuron Disease is actually a classification category that comprises all the diseases that are of motor-neurodegeneratory in nature. But Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis being the most common form of Motor Neuron Disease, it has vaguely become synonymous to its parent classification category.\nDiseases are very vaguely placed into this category with inconclusive inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following are the basic disease types that fall under this category or one can say they form this category.\nMotor Neuron Diseases are characterised by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration of motor neuron. But as explained earlier that classification is vague, so not all motor neuron degeneratory disorders fall under this category and rather they are placed into a broader category called \u201cMotor Neuron Disease Disorders\u201d example Spinal Muscular Atrophies falls into this broader category.\nLower Motor Neuron Degeneration \u2013 Except Primary Lateral Sclerosis, Pseudobulbar Palsy and Monomelic Amyotrophy rest all have LMN involvement.\nWith or Without Sensory Loss.\nBased on combination of above three criterion the pattern is categorised into three major pattern of combination.\nMND can present itself in children or in adults. If the onset is during childhood then it\u2019s usually inherited and in most of the cases it is Familial Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis. In adults usually it\u2019s found to affect after age of 40years.\nMost of the cases of MND tend to progress during course of time and worsen and in many cases they are even fatal depending on type of MND, say for instance ALS is a fatal type where as PLS is not.\nMotor Neuron Disease presents itself in various patterns of muscular weakness due to motor neuron degeneration which can show combination of patterns of symmetric or asymmetric, proximal or distal, focal midline or lateral, with or without sensory loss. Some of the signs and symptoms of Motor Neuron Disease are listed below.\nDifficulty in breathing, aggravated while lying down or on exertion. It may also cause respiratory failure.\nCognitive and behavioral changes like decision making, computing, word fluency, memory etc.\nHomeopathic Medicine should be selected as per type of Motor Neuron Disease and it\u2019s symptomatology.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T18:27:45Z", "url": "https://atomictherapy.org/motor-neuron-disease-mnd/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "\"You have a bunch of stuff and still talk about simplicity, what's with that?\"\nWell, I have accumulated a few things in my life. I used to make a lot of money (relatively speaking). I bought the Mercedes, the toys, the stuff.\nI have gotten rid of a lot, and am trying to learn to get rid of the rest. I want to keep only what I need, and maybe a few wants. It is hard. I grew up with little, so when I was making decent money, I wanted to buy the stuff I never had. Over time I have come to the realisation the stuff never made me happy. I found the doing is better than the having.\nI have acquired many of the things I have by coincidence or luck. I am not afraid to dumpster-dive. I take my kids if I can, we make it a game. I have stopped on the side of the road to pick up something that someone else is tossing out. My wheelbarrow came from the dump, some guy was tossing it because \"it's annoying\", whatever that means.\nI have traded a lot. Craigslist is my friend when it comes to trading.\nValue is the governing factor with the things I possess. I was going to say own, but I don't think I own anything, I just possess it until it leaves my possession. I still have trouble letting go though, some things just have too much potential.\nI feel qualified to share my experiences and tips with the world because I am actually doing every one of the steps on my list. I have been unemployed for 16 months (I did work for two months in the middle there). For ten of those months I collected no unemployment benefits. I now am collecting unemployment benefits (I felt that I shouldn't do it, but someone reminded me that it was my money). I am going to school on the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, and making it work on the little money I get from these two sources. My wife is a nurse and can make good money, but we choose for her to work less so she can be home for the summer with the kids. During the rest of the year she works and we save, we have eliminated most of our bills to make this a possibility. I am now unemployed by choice because juggling school, work, and kids is too much for anyone person and my heart goes out to those that manage to do it. My wife was in that position when we met and I quickly convinced her to stop working and let me handle the money part so she could continue her schooling. I saw how hard it can be, and do not want to do that myself (she is definitely stronger than me).\nI like stuff, it is programmed into me from my childhood, from TV, from the outside forces of the media and U.S. culture. I am trying to de-program myself.\nInstead of working hard just so we can pay the credit card bills and loans for the stuff we don't need, we work what we need to, just so we can do the things that give us the one thing we truly own, memories.\nI've recently started reading your blog after a connection from the Bike Trailer Blog. Your situations sound very similar to mine. I applaud you for continuing education even though it may be hard financially for your family. My wife supported me and worked while I finished my degree, though we didn't have our daughter until I graduated and got my first salary job. Now my wife doesn't work so she can stay home with the little one (18 months).\nYou also posted about getting rid of your car. This is something I did about 6 months ago. We have one car (Honda CRV) and I bike to work everyday though it's a short 10 blocks. I can say we are just now over the initial regret stage and are enjoying it. I have sacrificed a few things, but I have also gained a few things (non-material).\nI have a book recommendation for you since you're talking about getting rid of stuff. \"Put Your Life on a Diet\". This is a short read by a guy who lives by himself in a small 140 Sq. Ft. trailer. He's not saying you should live in a trailer, but he does have lots of ideas about slimming down not only yourself but everything else in your life. I was very inspired by this and have recently rid my entire house of things that haven't been used in one year (to the tune of about $400). Like you I am also a Craigslist veteran.\nI can't say I share your view on tools though. I feel it's less important to have a good set of tools and more important to have a neighbor who has a good set of tools (and a good relationship with such a neighbor). I've cleaned my gutters quarterly using my neighbor's 10 ft. step ladder.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T12:22:17Z", "url": "http://www.hackin5hit.com/2010/06/little-background.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Often thought of as a delicate ornamental, lavender is not only beautiful and aromatic, but pungent and powerful. Native to the Mediterranean, where it grows wild on sun-drenched hills, it has traveled far and wide and has taken up residence in gardens everywhere. With its lovely, lavender blue flowers and fragrant pungent odor, it as entwined itself into the hearts of women everywhere and is a very useful herb if we open to its strengthening and empowering qualities.\nLavender has long been valued for its ability to bring courage and strength to the user. Traditionally, sprigs of lavender were tied in bundles and placed in the hands of women in labor. Squeezing the fragrant bundles was believed to give them added strength and courage during childbirth. Lavender has long been used to calm nervous stress and is especially useful during menopause and menstrual difficulties. During the Middle Ages it was a valued remedy for hysteria. I\u2019ve found it can be very healing to women undergoing their periods of intense stress to place sprigs of lavender and lavender oil in the rooms of their home. Its essence brings calmness and inner strength to the user.\nIn every culture throughout the world you will find a great body of folklore concerning the indigenous plants of that region and the wise women who used them. For thousands of years women collected plants from meadows and woodlands and used them to create healing medicines. They gathered herbs by the waning and the waxing moon, artfully created preparations, and developed herbal formulas.\nThrough an intuitive communication with the plants, women learned the healing powers of these green allies. Their wisdom developed over countless years as remedies were tried, proven, and passed on. The best of these remedies were added to the lore, and the wisdom was transferred from mother to daughter, from wise woman to apprentice for countless generations.\nThis is the legacy we have inherited. Healers, wise women, simplers\u2014these women were the center and source of medicine and healing for their communities. They understood the cycles of the seasons, the ebb and flow of the universe, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the natural rhythms of their bodies.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T03:48:44Z", "url": "https://sewisewomen.com/resources-articles/category/women-s-wellness", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Previously there has been relatively little growth in this space, but with Facebook pumping swathes of cash into developing their online advertising, improvements are being released more and more frequently.\nFacebook is becoming an increasingly friendly advertising platform for retailers and e-tailers. However, the latest update for Facebook ads links retailers\u2019 Facebook ads to their offline, in-store products.\nThis means that Facebook can show more relevant stock to more relevant customers with up-to-date prices and stock levels.\nFor example, say your Brisbane donut store has baked 50 donuts for today, 30 Vanilla Swirl and 20 Face Invaders \u2013 because everyone loves donuts right? After the lunch rush you update your stock levels using your stock management system to show that you only have 10 Vanilla Swirl and 5 Face Invaders left.\nGet into our Brisbane store quick!

{"text": "(1) The scope of the individual services is based on the current service description in force at the time of placing the order.\n(2) If no other agreement has been expressly reached, the provider shall also be entitled to instruct expert staff or third parties to provide the services incumbent upon him. If active co-operation is required on the customer\u2019s part on another server, e.g. during the transfer of a web space package or other data stored on the provider\u2019s servers, the customer shall provide such co-operation in accordance with the provider\u2019s instructions and within the stipulated time.\n(3) If no other agreement has been reached the provider shall be entitled to demand payment in advance for all services ordered by the customer for the respective period.\nAll webhosting packages (\u201cvirtual servers\u201d) offered by the provider (Tomattos) assume a minimum service period of twelve months with an automatic extension of the agreement and the corresponding domains/servers for twelve months.\nAll server packages (dedicated servers, colocated servers, VPS, game servers) offered by the provider (Tomattos) assume a minimum service period selected by the customer when placing the order with an automatic extension of the contract and the corresponding domains/servers for the minium service period chosen by the customer.\n(4) Once the payment which had been made by the customer in advance for the agreed term has expired the contract is automatically terminated.\nThe domains associated with the packages/servers however, are charged for the complete contract period (this is dependent upon the domain extension and can be seen here) and must be terminated at least 4 weeks before expiry of the contract period in order to prevent automatic extension of the agreement (an extension is equivalent to renewed registration in respect of the contract period). If the package/server is terminated before the end of the contract for the relevant domain(s) or if the contract has not yet ended or has not yet been renewed, you will be charged separately to cover the remaining months of the domain service. The amount charged depends on the extension of the domain (for a complete list, please click here).\n(5) Given that the customer is placing the order as a private customer (as defined by \u00a7 13 BGB), the following applies: The customer has to pay the provider an appropriate fee which equals the the ratio of the services already rendered in relation to the total services intially intended for the contract, up to the point when the customer informed the provider about the enactment of his right of revocation regarding the contract. This is true in particular for yearly costs of ordering Internet domains. The reason for this is that these Internet domains are ordered individually according to the customer\u2019s wish from the responsible registry and such orders have to be paid by the provider for one year in advance. This is why advances rendered by the customer will be withheld, in general. Due to the installation and start of operation of the hosting services ordered by the customer (setup and configuration of the web space or server, the domain or the colocation space as well as the Internet uplink required, setup of upgrades, etc.), which the provider is contractually obligated to perform, the provider explicitly reserves the right to demand appropriate compensation for lost value if the costs for the services rendered by the provider in relation to the total services intended for the contract are not covered by advances made by the customer.\n(6) Should the provider be commissioned by the customer to provide services that are over and above the duties and responsibilities detailed in these General Terms and Conditions and in the service description (e.g. software-configuration, correction of errors or problems etc., that were not caused by the provider) the provider shall be entitled to demand adequate remuneration. In this case, a standard payment of \u20ac 25.00 per 15 minute unit of work shall be agreed. The provider may vary from this payment for the benefit of the customer as he sees fit.\n(7) The responsibility for backups of his data lies with the customer, not the provider.\n(8) The provider shall be entitled to to increase fees up to once per quarter. Such an increase requires the agreement of the customer. The agreement of the customer shall be given if he does not dissent within 4 weeks after receipt of the message informing him about the change. The provider is obliged to inform the customer about the repercussions of not dissenting within 4 weeks. As long as the main obligation, i.e. the obligation of payment of the basic usage-independent monthly remuneration, is not concerned, the provider determins the remuneration according to equitable discretion.\n(9) In case the value-added tax is increased, the provider shall be entitled to adjust the remuneration for goods and services, which are adduced or delivered within a continuing obligation, accordingly, starting at the point of time the value-added tax-change comes into effect.\n(10) It is agreed that payments made by the customer will not be refunded regardless of their original purpose \u2013 except in the case of an effective revocation, but then by inclusion of \u00a7 1(5). In case the customer made a payment higher than the amount of fees being required until the end of the contract and the fees for ordered services until then, it is agreed that the balance will not forfeit. Instead of a refund, the balance will be used for the provision of other / new services which the customer can order from the provider at any time.\n(1) The customer expressly assures that the provision and publication of web page content created either by himself and/or web pages created for him by the provider based on information provided by the customer neither infringes Bangladeshi law nor any other law applicable in the customer\u2019s country of residence, in particular copyright, data protection and competition law. The provider reserves the right to remove any pages from storage on his server that appear to be of dubious content. The provider shall immediately inform the supplier about any intended deletion of pages. The same shall apply if the provider is requested by third parties to change or delete contents of web pages because they allegedly violate third party rights.\n(2) The provider shall be entitled to delete any such web pages from hard disk storage on his web server if such pages are likely to infringe third party rights. He shall also be entitled to prevent access by third parties by taking any appropriate action. The provider undertakes to notify the customer immediately about any such measure. Should the customer be able to provide proof that there are no concerns regarding infringement of third party rights the provider shall make the web pages concerned available again to third parties. The customer hereby agrees to hold the provider harmless from any claims by third parties resulting from the content of materials on the customer\u2019s website(s).\n(3) The clauses 1 and 2 are also applicable for all other products offered by the provider which are suitable for publishing data, such as VPS or colocated servers.\n(1) Should domain registration or domain hosting form part of the services offered to the customer, the provider shall act only in the capacity of mediator between the customer, DENIC, InterNIC or other domain registration authority. Agreements with such organisations have the sole purpose of governing the customer\u2019s rights and obligations.\n(2) The provider has no influence on the delegation of domain names. He therefore cannot warrant that the registered domain names are not subject to claims by third parties or that they are unique or permanent. This also applies to sub-domains allocated within the provider\u2019s domain.\n(3) If the customer should be requested by a third party to surrender a domain because it may infringe third party rights, he shall inform the provider immediately. In such cases the provider shall be entitled to surrender the Internet domain on behalf of the customer. The customer hereby agrees to hold the provider harmless from any claims by third parties resulting from disputes regarding inadmissible use of domain names.\n(4) The customer hereby warrants to the provider that the address information (consisting of at least his name, address, telephone number and e-mail address) provided during registration or setting up a new account is correct and complete. Should this information change then the provider must be notified immediately in writing (letter, e-mail, fax). This and under certain conditions further information, will also be used for domains ordered by the customer from the provider.\n(1) If the provision of e-mail addresses or e-mail services forms part of the services offered by the provider, the limitations set out in \u00a7 3 shall apply analogously to e-mail addresses provided for the customer. The provider reserves the right to delete the customers e-mail messages if they are not retrieved from the mail server within 4 weeks of receipt.\n(2) If provision of access to public discussion forums (newsgroups) forms part of the services offered by the provider the time period over which public news is stored shall depend upon operational considerations of the provider.\n(3) The provider shall not be responsible for the e-mail addresses he provides; their use and management is outside the control of the provider. In the case of misuse, the provider shall be entitled to suspend all or individual e-mail addresses. The customer shall be informed immediately about such measures.\n(1) For webspace-packages, the following applies: The customer must ensure that his web site is designed such that the server is not excessively loaded, e.g. caused by CGI/PHP scripts requiring considerable computing power or above average memory usage. Excessive loading shall be defined as such usage of the aforementioned resources such that the operation of a Tomattos server is noticeably impaired or even crashes. Tomattos reserves the right to prohibit customers or third parties from accessing pages that do not comply with the aforementioned requirements.\n(3) For game servers, the following applies: Clan Servers will be supplied by the provider solely with password protection, so that players can only connect to them and participate in ongoing games after typing in a password. This password set by the provider may never be removed by the customer. Moreover, the password may never be completely or in part nor in any other way which will make it guessable or restorable be published in the server name or elsewhere. The password is to be kept secret by the customer and may only be passed on within his clan or a comparable community \u2013 to each player individually. The customer has to make sure that players who receive the password strictly adhere to this paragraph.\n(4) For game servers, the following applies: If the customer has ordered the upgrade \u201cTomattos branding\u201d for his game server, the name of the server will be extended by an advertisement supplied by the provider (e.g. \u2018by Tomattos.com\u2019). This extension by the provider may never \u2013 also not in part \u2013 be removed by the customer.\n(5) Should clause 1 to 4 be applicable, the provider reserves the right to immediately suspend the webspace package or server. This course of action will also be implemented should other sites stored on the server be affected by the customer\u2019s site. The customer shall be informed about any such suspension.\n(6) In case of such a suspension, solely the customer, not the provider shall be accountable for infringements of contracts. In any case the provider\u2019s claim of payment of remuneration remains, for the entire contract period.\n(1) The provider concedes complete and sole administration-rights on rented/colocated servers to the customer. Only the customer knows the individual administration-password of the server, not the provider. The provider is therefore unable to administrate the rented/colocated server. Hence the customer is solely and entirely responsible for administration and security of his servers, at his own expenses and risks. It is his duty to install necessary security-software and to inform himself constantly regarding security issues as well as to fix such by himself. Installation of maintenance software or other software does not absolve the customer from this duty.\n(2) Should customers receive fixed IP-addresses, the provider reserves the right to change these when technical needs arise and to inform the customer about his new IP-address.\n(3) If necessary and reasonable, the customer will assist at simple configuration changes, such as entering the login-data anew, or simple changes of his systems.\n(4) It is the customer\u2019s duty to configure his programs in such a way that they are restarted automatically when the hardware or the operating system is restarted.\n(5) For game servers, the following applies: The provider concedes complete and sole administration-rights on the rented game server to the customer, within the limits of the functional range of the web interface supplied by the provider. The customer, however, does not receive complete root or SSH access for the used game host server. The startup parameters of the game server cannot be changed by the customer.\n(1) The provider guarantees an annual mean 95%-availability of the physical connection of his webspace packages, dedicated, colocated, virtual servers and game servers. Exempted hereof are periods of time in which the servers are not reachable over the internet due to technical or other problems which do not lie within the provider\u2019s sphere of influence (force majeure, faults of third parties or of the customer).\n(2) The servers located in the datacenters of the provider are connected to the internet over a complex network infrastructure. Data traffic is routed over different active and passive network components (routers, switches, and other devices), which have a certain maximum data throughput. Therefore data throughput capacities can be limited for particular servers at particular points and not be equal to the maximum allowed data throughput of the respective switch-port. Unless otherwise agreed, the provider cannot give a guarantee for the amount of actually available bandwidth for individual servers, but makes available bandwidth depending on the technical capability of the datacenter, taking into account obligations towards other customers.\n(3) Customers can use the servers of the provider or own colocated servers for an manageable amount of different applications and use various software programms to this purpose, at their own discretion. Because of this, millions of different configurations are possible. The sheer diversity of these option does not permit the provider to give guarantees for the utilizability and compatibility of servers for a certain purpose.\nExcept for the specifications made in the description of the offer, the provider cannot give guarantees for the actual resources available for individual webspace packages, VPS and game servers. Rather, the provider makes available resouces depending on technical possibilities, taking into account obligations towards other customers.\n(1) The customer agrees that his personal data (basic data) and other information concerning use of the service (e.g. time, number and duration of connections, access passwords, uploads and downloads) may be stored by the provider during the period of the agreement should this be necessary for fulfilling the purpose of the contract, particularly for invoicing. The customer agrees to the storage of data. The provider may also processes and utilise such personal data that has been collected for the purpose of advising his customers, for advertising and market research for his own purposes and for structuring his telecommunication services in accordance with requirements. The customer shall be entitled to object to such use of his personal data.\n(2) Upon request by the customer the provider undertakes at any time and at no charge to provide full access to stored personal data pertaining to the customer. The provider shall not disclose this data or any of the customer\u2019s personal messages to third parties unless he is legally required to do so, in particular to government bodies or should this be required by internationally recognised technical standards.\n(3) The provider expressly points out that the protection of data privacy for data transmission across open networks such as the Internet cannot be fully guaranteed with current technology. The customer acknowledges and accepts that the provider is entitled at any time to view the websites stored on his server and, under certain conditions, any of the customer\u2019s data stored there if technical requirements so dictate. Other unauthorised Internet users may also be technically able to interfere with network security and control the flow of messages.\nThe customer warrants that all information he has given to Tomattos is correct and complete. Upon request the customer agrees to immediately inform Tomattos of any changes and to reconfirm that the data is currently correct within 7 days of receiving any such request.\n\u2013 and if the customer provides his own name server, the IP addresses of the primary and secondary name servers including the names of these servers.\n(4) The clauses in \u00a7 8 do not affect \u00a7 16(4).\nThe provider shall be liable for any damages caused by him or factors, servants and assignees through gross negligence or intent. In cases of violation of essential contractual obligations and slight negligence which lead to financial losses liability shall be limited to a liability insurance procured by the provider (with regard to the amount of liability) and to predictable, imminent losses (with regard to the type of liability).The limitations of liability stated above do not concern claims of the customer regarding product liability and especially do not apply for damage caused to the customer\u2019s health (or loss of life) attributable to the provider. Otherwise, liability is excluded.\nThe customer indemnifies the provider against all possible third party claims arising from any illegal action by the customer or from errors in the information provided by the latter. This applies in particular to copyright, data protection and competition law violations. Tomattos shall not be obliged to check the customer\u2019s websites for possible legal violations.\n(1) Applicable law is that of the The Peoples Republic of Bangladesh.\n(2) Any dispute resulting from this agreement shall be referred solely to a court of competent jurisdiction at the place of business of the provider.\n(2) In the case of incorrect direct debits/credit card debits (possibly caused by an overdrawn account, incorrect account data etc.) additional bank charges and increased administrative costs will arise for the provider. The provider will therefore charge a flat fee of \u20ac 15.00 for an incorrect direct debit and a flat fee of \u20ac 30.00 for an incorrect credit card debit.\n(3) In the case of a failed debit collection, the provider may immediately claim default interest fixed by law. Additionally, the provider shall be entitled to discontinue the service contract until payment is made. The provider shall be entitled to suspend the contract and reallocate the rented capacities. Data loss cannot be ruled out in this case. A one-time-fee of \u20ac 30.00 is computed by the provider when re-activating the service for the customer.\nIn the case of a non-payment until the second date mentioned in the demand note an additional fee of \u20ac 58.00 is computed for mandating a lawyer.\n(4) The provisions set out in paragraph 3 shall also apply in the case of non-payment if the customer has selected the payment option \u201cbank transfer\u201d, \u201cPayPal\u201d, \u201cSkrill\u201d, \u201cWestern Union\u201d or a similar, comparable payment option. Delay of payment is the case when, at the first of a given month, the services of the provider have not been prepaid for the entire month.\n(5) In case of NGO/NPO offers there is no refund or credit back. Any claim of such refubd or credit back will be not entertained. In additional lawyer charges may applicable in case of any legal procedure needed to perform.\n(6) In case of custom quoted servers, the non-refund and no credit back will applicable too.\n(7) Payment Policy Page terms will be also applicable except special cases.\nThe customer thus agrees to comply with the corresponding provisions and is responsible for observing them correctly.\nThese provisions may result in only having restricted or even not having the possibility to use otherwise purchased licenses of the customer with the servers of the provider. The provider will supply a license for all customer orders of Microsoft software products considering the Microsoft Service Provider License Agreement. This license allows the monthly use of the Microsoft software product on the server and limits its utilization permission with regard to some aspects. The customer particularly must not use Microsoft products which require additional or other licenses according to SPUR. The customer is obligated to comply with all these provisions on his own and is liable for violations against this usage policy to the provider and Microsoft.\n(1) The provider is obliged to enable a connection to the internet and a storing position for the server according to the respective product description.\n(2) The provider does not provide any guarantee for hardware damage which can result, for example, from transport to the datacenter, back to the customer or during going concern.\n(3) The provider grants the customer access to his server-system during the office-times published on the homepage of the provider in order to allow the customer to work on the server-system. This requires, however, a written request which has to be addressed to the support-department of the provider, at least 48 hours in advance. To access the server-system, the ID Card of the customer or a statement of authority signed by the customer is necessary. During the customer\u2019s presence in the datacenter, the provider has to fulfill various duties of supervision and control. Since this requires the attendance of the provider\u2019s personnel, costs of \u20ac 50.00 per started hour incur. With prior agreement, the provider can abstain from this at his sole discretion. If the appointment is not kept, the customer has to cancel it at least 2 hours in advance (if during office hours) or at least 12 hours in advance (if outside of office hours). If there is no cancellation within the stated time periods and the appointment is not kept, the customer will be billed for \u20ac 30.00.\n(4) Reboots are provided for free by the provider at the customer\u2019s request unless stated otherwise in the product description and unless the amount of reboots per month does not create disproportional effort.\n(5) Other technical support services are not included with the offer. If the help of a technician is required, costs of \u20ac 25.00 per started 15 minutes incur.\n\u2013 In case of an outage / non-availability of electricity, UPS or air conditioning, the provider will immediately, at the latest during the next working day, undertake all measures necessary to restore going concern.\n(7) Claims resulting from operational outage of peripherals (air conditioning, electricity) can only be asserted in case of violation of the guarantees mentioned in clause 6 up to the monthly amount for the colocated server and only if the outage has been lasting for over 72 hours (continuously, without breaks). If financial losses are claimed, these have to be substantiated and will be redeemed after verification up to an amout of \u20ac 500.00.\nIn case of an bandwidth-outage such claims are only valid if the guarantees regarding bandwidth made in \u00a7 7 clause 1 are undercut.\n(8) The provider does not assume liability for damage or loss of data.\n(9) The customer is responsible that the colocated equipment is flawless so that no negative impact for other devices can emanate from it.\n(10) The customer is liable for possible damages emanating from the server and is responsible for an adequate insurance.\n(11) If the provider informs the customer immediately, at least one month in advance, that he has decided to move to a different location, each party has a special cancellation right and can cancel the performances specified in this contract that are provided in the location which will change using written form. The cancellation will come into effect on the day the location is about to change. Given that the provider has informed the customer accordingly and neither party has made use of their special cancellation right, the contract continues unchanged at the new location. This clause does not come into effect if the reason for the change of the location is an instant dismissal of the rental agreement between the provider and his lessor. In this case, only clause 12 applies.\n(12) The customer is aware of the fact that the provider himself has to rent the datafloor. If this contract concerns the housing and bandwidth provided in the datacenter, the contract concerning this performance ends automatically at the point of time when the rental agreement between the provider and his lessor ends by means of an instant dismissal and the provider has been unable to find a suitable new location. The provider will inform the customer immediately. Other agreements remain untouched.\n(13) If the server of the customer needs more electricity or space than specified in the rented offer, additional housing-modules need to be rented \u2013 when only noticed later, this change will be retroactive. The number and price of the required additional modules is specified on the homepage of the provider.\n\u2013 The customer is informed immediately about such a change.\n\u2013 The customer has a special cancellation right for bandwidth and housing in the affected datacenter: He can cancel affected subscriptions within three months upon receipt of the message informing him about the change. This special cancellation right is valid during the mentioned three months-period. If it is not used, the contract continues under the adjusted conditions.\n(15) The customer agrees to the fact that the provider opens the case of the colocated server and adds a \u2018Web Resetter\u2019 to the reset-pin of the mainboard. Using this device, the provider is able to restart the server of the customer at any time if the customer requests it. Furthermore, the customer is able to reboot the server himself using the aforementioned device if he orders the necessary upgrade. In case the server is returned to the customer, the provider will remove the \u2018Web Resetter\u2019 again.\n(16) The customer is aware of and agrees to the fact that the provider publishes (Live-)video material and static pictures of his datacenter and that these videos/images might picture equipment or servers of the customer.\n(17) If the customer is in delay of payment for any performance between him and the provider, the provider has the right to keep the server and/or equipment of the customer in his posession until payment is made in full.\n(18) The customer grants the provider a lien on colocated servers and other equipment to back claims resulting from the contract between the provider and the customer. The lien only expires once all debt resulting from the contract between the provider and the customer has been paid and the contract has ended. Starting with the inception of treaty, the customer has to inform the provider immediately should the server not be or cease to be his property, be pledged or assigned. If the customer is entitled to other rights to the colocated server, especially expectant right, he assigns these to the provider in order to back debts resulting from the contract between the provider and the customer.\n(19) The lien and the contractual lien can also be asserted for claims resulting from former services or other claims.\n(20) If the provider excercises his lien, it shall suffice to send a written notice to the last known address of the customer. No further notice is required.\n(21) Legal liens are unaffected by these terms.\n(22) If the customer does not retrieve his server / other equipment within four weeks after the contract has ended, the provider will stock the items for a fee of \u20ac 10 per item and per month.\nThe provider has the right to change the subject terms of this contract as long as the changes are reasonable, taking into account the interests of the provider. The agreement of the customer shall be given if he does not dissent within 4 weeks after receipt of the message informing him about the change. The provider is obliged to inform the customer about the repercussions of not dissenting within 4 weeks.n.\n(1) Amendments or additions to this contract are only valid if they have been agreed to in writing. This also applies to any amendment of this clause relating to written notification.\n(2) All communications by the provider may be sent to the customer by electronic means. This also applies to invoices sent for services provided under the agreement.\n(3) The customer may only set off claims against the provider if such claims are established as undisputed or legally binding.\n(4) The provider is authorised to list the customer as a reference-customer without being obliged to pay a refund.\n(5) All prices quoted are not binding unless they are confirmed contractually. Errors and omissions in our prices excepted.\n(6) If any provision of this agreement is held to be invalid or becomes invalid or if there are omissions in the agreement that require rectification, the remaining provisions of the agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid provision or omission shall be replaced by a provision which comes closest to the intention of both parties as would have been agreed by the parties had they knowledge of such issues in advance.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T16:28:50Z", "url": "https://tomattos.com/terms-of-service-2/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

This was acceptable to many because they didn\u2019t know any other way. The common opinion was that women did not know how to care for themselves or what was good for them, therefore the men in their generations made all decisions for them.\nWhy wouldn\u2019t we just love it that way? We would be safe and cared for, knowing that someone else is making decisions in your best interest, providing for you and your children financially. In case you missed it, that was sarcasm. Historically, we know that while it worked for some lucky ones, many were oppressed by this system, whether they realized it or not.\nI\u2019m a person who pays my own way, and I work hard to do it. I make my own decisions, and even the thought of having no choices or being required to have another person oversee my life and make decisions for me with no right to an opinion is infuriating.\nYou know those cartoons with a snorting, angry bull with red vision, pawing the dirt, ready to charge?

Our own healthcare decisions, living life by our own choices.\nAbsolutely independent if we want to be. The land of the free, we love it.\n-did not have our rights to manage our own lives?

Again, note the sarcasm.\nTell me, if this type of control isn\u2019t acceptable for men to impose on women, why would it be acceptable for a government to impose that level of control over its citizens? Why would we knowingly elect officials who support these ideals?\nYou know those cartoons with a snorting, angry bull with red vision, pawing the dirt, ready to charge?

{"text": "The Congress of South African Trade Unions has noted the latest cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma. We can confirm that the federation did receive a courtesy call from President Jacob Zuma regarding his decision to reshuffle his cabinet this morning.\nWhile, we acknowledge that the president of the republic has a prerogative to reshuffle his National Executive as per the Constitution of the republic, we find the frequency of these cabinet reshuffles unsettling because they do not help to create the much needed stability at a government level. What compounds the situation is that some of these government departments are also witnessing an exodus of senior technocrats.\nAll of this is happening while workers and the poor are continuing to be victims of a system that has condemned millions of our fellow citizens to lives of brute survival. Our economy is currently haemorrhaging jobs at an alarming rate and it does not help that we are also experiencing this kind of political uncertainty and policy incoherence from government.\nCOSATU expects cabinet reshuffles to be about strengthening the capacity of government in order to help government to better implement its developmental agenda and deliver on its promises. We are not convinced that this reshuffle is informed by that ,considering that some of the most ineffectual ministers like Minister Bathabile Dlamini, Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, and Minister Mosebenzi Zwane are still part of the National Executive.\nThese recent cabinet reshuffles have done very little to help take the National Democratic Revolution forward. We call on the African National Congress to reflect deeply about the state of the economy and the overall performance of its government. The majority of workers are facing a bleak future and the people South Africa need a clear sign that the government has a plan to rescue them from poverty and kick-start this economy.\nAs COSATU , we will continue to work with and support the newly elected ministers and deputy ministers with the hope that they will prioritise a people driven and people centred development.

{"text": "Anesthesia is administered to patients who are undergoing otherwise stressful or painful medical procedures, such as operations or tooth extractions. The anesthesia blocks pain and renders the patient unconscious so that the health care professional may work without concern over the patient\u2019s discomfort or interference. Nurse anesthetists work either independently or under the supervision of a physician or anesthesiologist. They administer the anesthetics, adhering to the plan plotted by the anesthesiologist or physician. The nurses must be careful and precise as giving too little anesthesia can be just as detrimental as giving too much. Nurse anesthetists work in a variety of health care settings, including dental, podiatric, and obstetrician offices, as well as hospitals.\nNurses specializing in anesthesia must be registered nurses (RNs) because of the complexity and sensitivity of the duties. Though one can become an RN by completing either a diploma program from a nursing school, an associate degree in nursing, or a bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing and successfully passing the NCLEX-RN examination, those wishing to go into anesthetics must obtain a graduate nursing degree. Nurse anesthetists must earn at least a master\u2019s degree in health care, have experience working as an RN, and enroll in a nurse anesthetist program. After completing the anesthetist program, nurses must pass an examination given by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, which will gain them certification and licensure to practice.\nAs the health care field grows, the demand for medical services will grow as well. While many medical services are routine and non-invasive, more than 26 million people in the country undergo medical procedures that require anesthesia, according to the Mayo Clinic. With these numbers, the need for nurse anesthetists is clear. As the population climbs, the increase in the number of patients flowing into physician offices every day will also boost the need for more nurse anesthetists. Nurse anesthetists earn varying salaries depending on their level of experience. Nurses who have less than a year of experience earn about $112,190 annually, whereas nurses who have five to nine years of experience earn about $132,368 annually.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T08:54:45Z", "url": "http://www.nursingdegree.net/nursing-specialties/nurse-anesthetist.htm", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "On Saturday, Feb. 24 at 8 p.m., the 12th annual Arab Music Ensemble (AME) will take place in the Performing Arts Center. The ensemble features an orchestra, a choir and traditional dances to braid together an enriching experience of Eastern Mediterranean music and the historically interconnected cultures of the larger region.\nEthnomusicologist and Director Ken Habib has been working closely with more than 25 musicians and singers to perfect the melodic and metric modes from the genres of this part of the world. San Luis Obispo Dance Director Jenna Mitchell will lead dancers in choreography that interacts with the complexities of the music. The concert will feature guest artists Ishmael on qanun (trapezoidal zither), Fathi Aljarrah on kamanja (violin) and Faisal Zedan on riqq (tambourine), daff (frame drum) and darabuka (goblet drum).\nA variety of instruments such as these will be used to shape a harmonious sound that delves into the traditional music of the Eastern Mediterranean region. This will all be in quarter tone, which is a unique pitch characteristic of these genres of music. The exposure to instruments and sound that students may not be familiar with will contribute to the distinct journey through the experience of AME.\n\u201cIt\u2019s out of the paradigm of Western European classical music, which is what the music departments in the United States historically have centered on, exclusively,\u201d Habib said.\nCal Poly music alumnus Brandon Webb noted the value of being exposed to a diverse variety of music outside of Western European classical music. Webb is the percussion section leader and is responsible for giving the drummers guidance and keeping a steady tempo for them. He will be playing the doumbek (goblet drum) as well the daff (frame drum).\nDespite the fact that some musicians involved with AME have not grown up with this specific kind of music, both those who are just learning it and those who have it weaved into their own roots can come together to collaborate in the ensemble.\n\u201cThe experience at AME is very divided between the people that want know more of the culture and the people that call this culture home. I know my fellow musician AJ and I have grown up with this kind of music and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re very attached to,\u201d liberal arts and engineering studies senior Michelle Naziri said.\nHabib expressed that the AME has a following of people who have been attending the concert for years, some of whom also have this music embedded in their roots. He hopes the concert is sophisticated enough to resonate with this audience, but also transparent enough and multivalent enough to resonate with people who are hearing it for the first time.\n\u201cThe arts are an expression of reality in a way, just like the sciences are. We interact with our world \u2026 Human beings are intrinsically artistic. Music, for example, is, as far as we know, a part of every single society in the world and historically has always been a part of every single society in the world.\u201d Habib said.\nThe universality of music, along with the evidence of music as an essential part of history, demonstrates the richness of humanity, which Habib said we need to focus on by embracing our differences rather than being afraid of them. Regardless of musical literacy or experience, the AME said they hope the people who attend the concert will thoroughly enjoy it.\n\u201cI hope that they enjoy the musical experience of being, in a sense, a musical person in society because everybody is musical even if you don\u2019t sing or play an instrument, because we listen to it and appreciate it.\u201d Habib said.\nTickets are available at the Cal Poly Ticket Office with prices ranging from $12 to $14 for the public and $9 to $12 for students.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T14:11:10Z", "url": "http://mustangnews.net/cal-poly-arab-music-ensemble-perform-feb24/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Being charged with a DUI is just the beginning of a long and traumatic process. Your best chances of getting a good outcome or even a DUI dismissal is to retain a good DUI lawyer in Arizona. They will be able to determine what defense strategies may be used in your case.\nWere you charged with a DUI based on one breath test result?\nVirtually all experts concede that one breath test alone is unreliable. Breath testing is subject to various inaccuracies, including a variance as much as +/- 10.0%. This could be increased due to other factors. Therefore, two breath tests must be conducted.\nThere are many DUI defense strategies that can be used to argue your AZ DUI case against the State and prosecution. This defense is just one of many involves breath testing. Below is an excerpt from the book \u201c101 DUI Defenses 101 DEFENSES TO BEAT YOUR ARIZONA DUI \u00a9\u201d written by James Novak, Arizona DUI and Criminal Defense Attorney. For more DUI defenses, the abridged version of this E-book can be downloaded free by visiting www.arizonacriminaldefenseattorney.com.\nArizona has earned the reputation for being one of the toughest states on DUI charges in the country. The DUI laws are strict and penalties severe. If charged or arrested for an Arizona DUI, you should contact an Arizona DUI Lawyer as soon as possible. Even for first time offenders, the penalties are designed to \u201cteach a lesson\u201d so that the defendant will avoid a repeat offense and to get the word out, that Arizona has zero tolerance for those driving \u201cimpaired to the slightest degree\u201d or who may be drunk driving in Arizona due to alcohol or drugs.\nPenalties for convictions of first time, misdemeanor DUI in Arizona, depending on the circumstances may include mandatory jail time, suspension of driver\u2019s license, fines, fees, probation, mandatory counseling, and court ordered interlock devices on your vehicle to be installed at your expense.\nArizona Felony DUI or Aggravated DUI, charges can include lengthy prison terms, suspension of driver\u2019s license, exorbitant fines, fees, probation, mandatory counseling at your cost, and court ordered interlock devices on your vehicle to be installed at your expense. The Arizona Courts are especially harsh on repeat offenders and Arizona penalties reflect this.\nMany people make the common mistake of trying to seek counsel of a friend regarding their DUI who is not a licensed Arizona DUI or criminal Defense Attorney in Arizona. Resist this temptation. They are not walking in your shoes. They were not arrested. They will rarely know the Arizona DUI laws inside and out, current legislation, changing laws, defense strategies, and be experienced in defending cases in the Arizona criminal justice system. They will not bear the consequences of your DUI charges if they are not properly defended by a qualified DUI lawyer in Arizona.\nAfter an arrest for drunk driving, or DUI with drugs or medication, you should consult an attorney as soon as possible, to discuss your charges and defense options. Be sure that the Arizona DUI lawyer is experienced and defends cases often in the jurisdiction or city where you were arrested and received formal DUI charges or criminal charges. For example if you were arrested in Mesa Arizona, by Mesa Police, but you reside in Phoenix AZ, your DUI charges will be filed in Mesa Arizona, and your case will be heard through the Mesa AZ City Court. Make sure your DUI attorney defends DUI or criminal charges frequently in Mesa Arizona. It will benefit your defense if your DUI Lawyer is familiar with the court system, prosecution, and judges to hear DUI cases on a daily basis in Mesa AZ through the criminal justice system.\nThe best Arizona DUI lawyers begin defending your case with the thought process of building defense strategies that will lead to getting your Arizona DUI dismissed. That is where a good Arizona DUI Defense Attorney starts. They will base their decisions on how and what defenses to utilize based on the individual circumstances surrounding your case. Top DUI defense Attorneys in Arizona will know when and how to present their compelling arguments in your favor to get your charges dismissed. Depending on the strength and/or weakness of the prosecutions case, your AZ DUI attorney will examine the evidence, to determine if any evidence can justifiably be suppressed (not used against you). If the charges can not be dismissed, they will then attempt to negotiate with the prosecution a way of getting the charges reduced to a lesser charge, for example: a criminal charge down to a non-criminal charge, a felony to a misdemeanor, an extreme DUI to a non-extreme DUI and reduce the DUI penalties against you. In other words, in absence of being able to get the Arizona DUI charges dropped, a good AZ DUI defense attorney will make every effort to get the best possible outcome in your case.\nIf you are stopped by police for Arizona DUI, generally the police officer will use a set of five-to-six common tests called Field Sobriety Tests (FST). One thing that top Arizona Criminal Defense and DUI attorneys agree on is that so many aspects of the FST can be challenged on behalf of your defense, in an effort to get your case dismissed or charges reduced.\nTool o determine if further breath or blood tests are needed. Then they will later use your performance of these tests against you. They will make it sound like you did poorly on the tests. But in fact, even a person unimpaired by drugs or alcohol may perform these tests to a \u201cpoor\u201d standard. That is why they are often challenged.\nWAS YOU BATTERY OF FST CONDUCTED WITH CLIMATE, ENVORNMENTA OR LANDSCAPING DISADVANTAGES TO YOU?\nThe roadside could be uneven and covered by debris. The climate conditions could cause inability to perform the tests well. Were you doing the tests a surface on a hill, or a surface that contained mud, rocks, melting tar or oil, ice, snow drifts or other rough or other unsmooth or level surface? NHTSA requires that the Walk and Turn & the One Leg Stand be performed on a smooth, level surface.\nDid the officer report that you failed or did poorly on the HGN test?\nThis is the \u201cfollow the pen with your eyes test\u201d actually has a very complicated name- the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (\u201cHGN\u201d) test. This test is allegedly meant to measures the involuntary jerking of the eye when a person is impaired by alcohol. When medical doctors conduct this test they do so in an areas with good lighting, employing medical equipment that holds the patient\u2019s head still and clearly lists the angles. The officer, for one test, must determine whether he detects the onset of nystagmus prior to 45%. It is almost impossible without be accurate on the angle. The test can be challenged as invalid under almost all roadside and lighting conditions.\nDid the breath test operator possess a valid, unexpired operator\u2019s license?\nIf not, the DUI breath test result is inadmissible.\nWas your blood sample preserved properly?\nThe preservation process can be an issue. The blood vials must have been stored properly prior to its use. The blood vials must not be used beyond the expiration date. The blood vials must be preserved in order to provide your defense attorney with the opportunity to test the sample with an independent lab for purposes of objectivity in your defense.\nWas the blood kit and contents in the kit, within the expiration date period? Was it properly sealed, packed, inspected, and maintained at the required temperature? When the police take your blood they usually do so using a pre-packed blood kit. However, safekeeping and inspection of the kits must be routinely performed to ensure that tubes have not expired, are sealed properly and are kept in an appropriate place that is not temperature extreme like the trunk of the car in the summer heat of Arizona.\nWas your urine sample properly tested?\nThe urine taken for drug testing must also be properly tested according to required testing procedures and protocol, for timing, specimen handling, transport, labeling, and preservation, including the containers for which the urine specimen is stored.\nWas your blood drawn within three hours of consuming your last alcoholic beverage?\nIt can take up to three hours for alcohol to be absorbed in your blood stream. If the blood draw was outside of the three hour window, the results of the BAC may be challenged as invalid.\nThese are just a few aspects of items that can be challenged to your favor if you have received Arizona DUI charges. That is why it is important to hire an Arizona DUI attorney who defends cases in the jurisdiction for which you were charged with the AZ DUI, and challenges such issues on a daily basis. It takes experience, special skills, training, knowledge and a great amount of defense litigation experience to challenge these issues in your defense. The ultimate goal of your AZ DUI Attorney is to examine some of these issues to pave the way for flaws in the prosecutions case for total dismissal, or in the alternative reduction of charges, suppression of evidence, and getting the best outcome in your case.\nA Mesa \u201cFelony DUI\u201d is also known as \u201cAggravated DUI\u201d. If you\u2019ve been arrested or face Felony DUI (Driving under the Influence) charges in Mesa, AZ the best advice you can get now is to consult a good Arizona Criminal Defense Attorney or Felony DUI Defense Attorney who defends cases frequently in Mesa Municipal Court.

Since the delay mentioned in the press release was not such an emergency, and issuing the statment close to midnight was unnecessary, the Association said.\nHalf of newspapers in Hong Kong were unable to report the delay, thereby seriously affecting the public\u2019s right to know.\nUnder Secretary for Transport and Housing Yau Shing-mu.

{"text": "\u2013 For building bridges from deterministic, linear and Cartesian thought and word use, by exploring our observations of the environments and their living systems affecting our ideals.\nA diverse work group of 6 to 20 people would be assembled, helped by a facilitator, needing about an hour to just go through the basic 3Step process. It\u2019s NOT a discussion group, of people offering opinions, but a learning group of people offering connecting observations. During the session they\u2019d need to be able to write as they talk, building on each other\u2019s observations, starting from being given or choosing an ideal goal to work with.\nThey\u2019d use that ideal to lead them on an exploration of what people in the group already know from observing their cultural, economic & ecological environments, sharing with each other things they\u2019ve seen are happening that could affect achieving the ideal. The product is a large collection of freshly shared observations on what\u2019s happening and how it connects; they\u2019d need to work with to proceed to planning for investments in changing their environment.\nTo work well in the UN\u2019s OWG setting, a few work groups might be organized in the same space, to work at the same time, each with their own facilitator. A prior process of facilitator training is needed, on now how to recognize environmental systems at work and ways of raising productive questions to help work groups fully explore what they know.\nFacilitators should have a combination of interests in human and natural economies, social science and natural science, some management and organizing experience. A facilitator\u2019s guide to the method and the systems science behind it is in preparation.\nIt\u2019s easy for people to talk about the ideals they\u2019d like to see in the world, and talk endlessly about them. Ideals don\u2019t tell you much about how to change the world to bring out your ideals, though. So I designed a very simple way to draw people into exploring the working parts of their own cultural & economic environments, that their ideals will need to work with, to help suggest practical interventions designed to \u201cwork with nature\u201d to bring out their ideals.\nI call it the 3Step process, and have been developing it in part prompted by Ambassador Korosi having showed some interest in my efforts to steer the OWG process toward studying what SDG\u2019s need to work with to succeed. People tend not to be drawn into thinking about how the complex connecting parts of their environments actually work together, though, being more comfortable just thinking and talking about how their own values and how their own mental environment works. But, if we have important ideals, that can only be achieved working with the world around us, that can draw people into learning how to turn their ideals (SDG goals) into practical ways to get involved (SDI interventions) to bring out their ideals in their real environment.\n3) Possible ways to intervene and bring out that ideal, working with those environments.\nNote: While others are talking try to both listen carefully and take quick notes on thoughts that come up as they speak. Ask the guide to suggest other things to look for if the flow of ideas lags. Don\u2019t be sidetracked to dwell on any one subject.\nDuring and after the discussion collect everyone\u2019s notes on a common note page, like a TitanPad, a chalk board, a Wiki etc., to solidify the rich variety of ideas discussed, understood as valuably interconnected starting points to think over in further study.\nThe process both brings people with different viewpoints together to see how useful the different things they\u2019re aware of about how their environments work can be when combined, and also to draw people into exploring just how much they already know themselves, freed to explore with interest what they\u2019ve observed about how things work, without preconception for how the information will be used.\nI tried using it in a Commons Cluster conference call a couple months ago. It worked splendidly to bring out lots of productive observations no one person could have collected. Some work on the method is still needed, to make it more of a real tool to use rather than just a cool way to bring up interesting new issues.\nIt\u2019s a scientifically designed method for bringing out what groups of people can see they\u2019ll need to work with in their environments to achieve their ideals. If developed as part of a process for designing real interventions to invest in for changing the environment, it will also help greatly expand the discussion general discussion of how to work with nature\u2019s working parts.\n3. Instead of the 3rd step, a period for discussing possible interventions at the end, you could have people take 5 minutes to work independently and write down one or two suggested intervention ideas to propose, in 20 words or less. Then to end the meeting each person could read theirs. That would end the meeting with a sort of \u201csurprise package\u201d of forward thinking, and help motivate people to contribute their notes to the wiki or public pad.\n4. for youth groups, after coming to a focus on some ideal they feel passionately about, you could make the environmental observations of Step 2 a guessing game, with each person getting a turn to think of and give hints to others trying to guess something they know of happening socially, economically, politically or ecologically that is important to take into account.\n5. somewhat like #1, you could have a 15min \u201cworld witness\u201d period just before coffee hour as a regular part of a church service. Some places it would be \u201ca crazy idea\u201d, other places not. The 3Steps approach is highly flexible and versatile, if you prepare a bit and get people to \u201cjust bear witness\u201d to what they can see happening that their ideals have to work with to get anywhere, expressing their awe of the natural world\u2019s movements and changes it is ours to deal with.\nGlad you\u2019re thinking about it. I\u2019ve been hoping to get feedback each time I offered the basic idea of the 3Step SDG design process, using our ideals for the \u201cworld we want\u201d to help us explore the real \u201cworld we have\u201d, to see what we have to work with. It\u2019s like going to \u201cdesign school\u201d, where the big task for an artist learning how to draw is first learning \u201chow to see\u201d. To change a particular environment, a designer needs to first learn to discover what\u2019s in the environment to work with, and like anything, it takes learning new habits.\nIt does help to have a vague idea what you\u2019re looking for, like the ideal statement of an SDG, but having any other preconception of what you\u2019re looking for will blind you to what\u2019s really there. As one instructor put it once, \u201cevery design should begin with reading book zero\u201d. It\u2019s usually the most important step in a design, and leads to getting the best kinds of results, just getting to know what there is to work with, in its own right.\nIn that way it\u2019s not so different from how anyone goes about designing a child\u2019s Halloween costume. There may be some vague image to begin with, but the real work begins with looking through the materials available, and then trying out this and that till you find a way to make something wonderful. I\u2019m sure you can think of lots of times where someone has only the vaguest idea of what they\u2019re planning on making until they\u2019ve rummaged through all the things that they might use.\nThat\u2019s the idea, anyway, to just get people to rummage through their cultural and economic environments, as if seeing and exploring them as if for the first time, learning about what they\u2019ll either have or need to work with to advance the ideal they want to design for. It\u2019s critically important to get the steps in the right order, and explore the materials of the environment you\u2019d need to work with before making a plan for what to do.\nIt\u2019s like going to \u201cdesign school\u201d, where the big task for an artist learning how to draw is first learning \u201chow to see\u201d. To change a particular environment, a designer needs to first learn to discover what\u2019s in the environment to work with, and like anything, it takes learning new habits.\nThis \u201clearning \u2018how to see'\u201d is the key issue for me in \u201ctransforming\u201d an old educational system that actual seems to close down that \u201copen-seeing\u201d to \u201cdiscarding\u201d any idea that isn\u2019t immediately familiar to one\u2019s already habituated \u201cways of seeing\u201d and some of the \u201cblinder prejudices\u201d (and some actually are indeed prejudices) that one has not learn well to easily \u201cexcavate\u201d and thus remain aware of, especially in understanding a \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d environment.\nKey, so key to that is the ability to \u201clisten openly\u201d to those from that different environment and understand the world through their \u201cways of seeing\u201d and \u201chearing\u201d and more their analysis of the problem(s) to address. This is that critical \u201cdesign\u201d process step that is so key for me as an educator trying to train minds/eyes/ears and hearts to \u201csee\u201d in \u201cglobal\u201d more creative, right brain ways because otherwise too much of the non-linear, non-verbal communication is missed and thus the problem(s) itself poorly or only partly understood. This is that critical mis-step that I think too often sets us from the outside trying to help, for failure: you cannot really help solve problems you didn\u2019t really fully grasp.\nTrue \u201copen-mindedness\u201d in a reductionist, linearly, overly-rationally trained world or previous education system is to me the hardest and least understood of the skill-sets needed to do this. What I call the \u201cemotional/social and cultural intelligence skill sets\u201d that most \u201celitely-educated\u201d Westerners are negatively trained in, if at all (in worst cases creating unintended arrogance and ego-investment in \u201ctheir\u201d ideas over all others).\nThis is also a skill set that needs to be explicitly \u201cre-taught\u201d to combat this tendency. It is my \u201chardest\u201d work in trying to explain the underlying \u201ctransformative\u201d premise of the new educational model the TEF is supposed to represent, given that I and most of us involved in these issues at these levels were so \u201cwell-trained\u201d in the \u201cold\u201d more limiting frames.\nFor myself, I spent years \u201cre-learning\u201d this from the children I taught, so much more willing to teach me gently and because I could not at first \u201cunderstand\u201d why how I was taught to teach was actually \u201churting\u201d their learning and their hearts.\nThat was motivation enough to get me to understand why and why emotional intelligence and that necessary empathetic listening is so critical to all true learning.\nI\u2019m a natural systems scientist, that studies both how the organizations of nature develop and operate and also how they\u2019re perceived by popular and professional communities. Maybe the most profound thing I\u2019ve found is that \u201cpopular social culture trumps objective science\u201d just about everywhere. It seems to be because, for various reasons, \u201cscience doesn\u2019t work socially\u201d.\nWe need **something that works socially** for a human society to establish itself and be sustainable, a very basic social requirement seeming to stem from how human societies first developed. So\u2026. it\u2019s the social networks which end up being responsible for defining the foundations of our beliefs, and deciding what is meaningful to the society, creating our common reality and the nature of our experience of it.\nThe miracle is that all social networks more or less equally *experience* the natural world and how it works, but generally don\u2019t study it. As a result\u2026 we end up defining our shared ideas about reality without actually studying how the natural world works too. That social role in defining our cultural reality evidently holds true **even within the scientific and business communities**, as the basis for the many \u201csilos\u201d of exclusive knowledge that permit only their version of reality of the wider social agreement on the nature of the culture\u2019s common reality.\n\u2026\u2026 So to give social networks a better foundation on which to build our common \u201crealities\u201d I devised a neat trick. It\u2019s for getting them to look at what\u2019s happening in the natural world\u2019s, without any preconception as to \u201cwhat it\u2019s for\u201d.\nIt helps people notice how much they actually knew about how their world works but never put together before, and discover what they need to use and work with to get it to work for them, but may have never really asked before.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T14:59:32Z", "url": "http://synapse9.com/signals/2013/07/03/3steps-process-for-working-with-nature/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Gerry Weber dresses and clothing embraces the city, sporty and business designer wear for women. Gerry Weber is known for his extravagant detailing and fine workmanship. These exceptional details, top-quality materials, beautiful colours, and a superb fit make up the casual yet elegant Gerry Weber look. Weber designs feminine forms, tasteful designs, and statement pieces.\nGerhard Weber was born in Halle in Westphalia, Germany, with its 20,000 inhabitants, half-timbered houses and cobblestones. From this beginning, he joined the ranks of high fashion, alongside Parisian and Milanese born designers. Weber was initially a textile salesman, who opened his first fashion shop in 1965. The clothes racks were housed at first in his parents\u2019 garage.\nIn 1973, alongside a childhood friend, Weber founded a company for the production of women\u2019s trousers. This was the birth of the Gerry Weber brand. The company expanded their production bit by bit and today also manufactures a wide range of women\u2019s blouses, dresses, jackets, coats, and knitwear too.\nWeber\u2019s strong, single fashion pieces are carefully attuned to one another when designed, meaning that it is simple to put together an outfit that really works and is individual to you and to build a wardrobe where clothes can work in different ways when put together. Weber design separates with outfits in mind, and the intelligent buyer who knows her own style can create further outfits, with a knowledge of what works for her own look and style. Yet these pieces are also designed to look superb in their own right or paired with simple separates.\nThe fact that these clothes are designed to make statement outfits makes Gerry Weber dresses and separates superb investment pieces. Each individual customer can create an outfit, look or wardrobe to reflect and express her personality and to make the most of her existing wardrobe.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T02:42:30Z", "url": "https://www.normajames.com/product-category/gerry-weber-dresses-clothing/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "UPDATED! Scroll down to see who won!\nBefore I get into the review, the photos and the details, let me say we will have THREE winners for this amazing giveaway which includes a Springfield Girls doll, the Springfield Collection Storage Trunk for 18\u2033 dolls, outfits and accessories to fill it! WOW. Now on to the photos, my insight and how to enter (scroll to the bottom of the post to find out how to enter).\nLet\u2019s start by meeting the Springfield Collection. Maria, Olivia, Madison, Abby and Emma are a line of very affordable 18\u2033 vinyl play dolls that are similar to American Girl, Journey Girls, Madame Alexander and other lines. The Springfield Girls dolls can be purchased at Michaels craft stores nationwide, along with other stores like A.C. Moore and Joanns. The dolls run approximately $20 and if you use one of the retailers coupons you can get them even less expensive. Their accessories are adorable and make excellent stocking stuffers, gifts for friends, and birthday party favors.\nThe girls come dressed in simple meet dresses and they make a perfect friend for your other 18\u2033 dolls, are great as a starter doll for a young girl who is just getting into dolls or as a model for your sewing projects. Like American Girl dolls, they have vinyl faces and limbs and soft bodies. The Springfield Girls limbs are not strung like American Girl, rather they are sewn in. The girls have a hard time standing without shoes on, but once you dress them up and put shoes on their feet, they do great!\nIn this photo Abby and Madison are modeling some of the outfits we received for review. Abby is wearing the Plaid Tunic and Leggings outfit ($9.95) with a pair of Springfield Collection Crocs that we already had. Madison is so comfy in the Pajamas and Bunny slippers from the Pajamarama Set which includes two pair of jammies and slippers for $16.99. Madison is very happy to be here and immediately went to the library and picked out her favorite Cecile book and found the comfy chair I had made earlier this fall.\nThis is Maria (some packaging still says Sophia but her name has been changed) modeling the Pop Princess outfit from the gift set while standing in front of the Storage Trunk. The Storage Trunk is made of sturdy cardboard and features two hanging racks and two drawers to keep your doll\u2019s accessories neat and tidy.\nI have more photos of the Springfield Girls in action and will be posting them throughout the weekend, but I want to get this awesome giveaway started first!!

{"text": "Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica (Acta) is an international journal that publishes articles within the fields of anaesthesia, intensive care medicine, pain, and emergency medicine. The journal is owned by the Scandinavian Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (SSAI), and thereby also by the 5 Nordic national societies which make up the SSAI. Most of the submissions and articles are related to perioperative medicine, and each year we receive nearly 1000 manuscript submissions. The majority are from outside Scandinavia, and only around one-third of the printed articles are from Scandinavia. Last year we rejected more than 75% of all submitted manuscripts.\nMembers of the SSAI (and of the national societies of the 5 Nordic countries) recieve full text access to the journal (and potentially a print version, if allowed by the national society) as part of their SSAI membership. The journal is the flagship of the SSAI.\nManuscript handling is electronic, using ScholarOne, and all articles can be read or downloaded from the journal homepage, including the first articles from 1957 and those most recently accepted but not yet printed (Early View). The homepage also contains interesting lists of most accessed and most cited articles.

{"text": "Some words remain etched on your mind no matter when you read them. That\u2019s the power of words. I particularly believe in these words of Paulo Coelho \u2013 \u201cWhen you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it.\u201d That\u2019s perhaps what had lead me to believe that if you truly want something (and if you work for it), it will definitely happen.\nOur instincts are often right. When we tend to ignore it, we end up making a mistake. However, when your intuition fails in certain rare instances, you look for signs that help you decide whether you should go for something or not. Remember how you spend all day wondering where to travel for your next holiday and you suddenly see an advertisement of a traveler enjoying his stay in Switzerland. It looks like the world is try to tell you something.\nBeing hungry on a weekend is extremely dangerous. When Zomato and Swiggy are just a touch away, things could get complicated if you act on an impulse. The consequences are frightening. So we should exercise utmost caution, and also perhaps (senior) adult supervision , while adding items to our cart.\nI don\u2019t cook the most Instagram-worthy meals every weekend, but roughly plan it on Fridays to avoid spending 2 hours discussing what to cook. I avoid cooking more than 2 meals a day, so apart from breakfast and lunch we normally eat out once a week or head over to mom\u2019s place for some cozy meal. So the main meals are taken care of. It\u2019s the cravings between the meals that tend to push me towards Zomato or Swiggy.\nOn one such weekend, my husband and I quickly finished our weekend chores and settled to eat a nice healthy, home-cooked meal. Things were fine till my mind started asking for something more. No, I didn\u2019t want another serving of what we were eating. This time the call was for something sweet or crispy, something which people would not consider healthy. When I told my husband about this, he asked me to order online as he was scared I would then ask him to cook something. I was furious with him for letting me cheat so easily and told him he should help me in times like these when I was craving for junk food.\nI wasn\u2019t sure if I welcomed this unexpected testing of my will power (not really sure if I had any in the first place!). I tried to divert myself with some movie and switched on the TV. Tata Sky told me I could subscribe to some new food channel. Strike 1. I wanted to stay away from all cookery shows and in the random channel I switched to, Sanjeev Kapoor was revealing the secrets behind making a very appetizing biryani. Strike 2. You know how you go someplace and the first person you bump into is the person you wanted to avoid. That\u2019s exactly how it felt. Anyway, I was scanning through the channels checking for a decent movie and settled for a movie on Romedy Now- No Reservations. Guess what the hero and the heroine did? They were chefs at this amazing restaurant and they were whipping up mouth-watering dishes and even delectable desserts. Strike 3.\nI could bear it no longer and finally gave in. I usually decide quickly and in a matter of seconds, I set my mind on having an ice cream. We headed to Amadora, our favourite ice cream place in Chennai and treated ourselves to some delicious flavours of ice creams (dark chocolate sorbet and salted caramel).\nThere is a limit to the temptations a human being can resist. And when it comes to foodies like me, it doesn\u2019t take much effort to get tempted. Initially I choose to ignore my instincts which was telling me to satiate my cravings. However there were obvious signs everywhere that were impossible to ignore. I knew the world was trying to tell me something. How could I not listen to what it was trying to convey? It\u2019s important that we follow the orders of the world. I was pretty sure these messages were intended for me. Wondering how I\u2019m that confident? You see, while some eat to live, I belong to the group which lives to eat!\nSo, watch out for these signs. You never know how the world might try to help you.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T14:47:27Z", "url": "https://ashwinicn.com/2017/04/08/when-your-world-lends-a-hand/?shared=email&msg=fail", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Addiction Step Eleven: Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.\nWhat is your understanding of God and how would you characterize your relationship with Him? I can open up any number of books and read about God, or read the Bible and not know anything about His nature and character. Through these steps, how has your perception of God changed? We have talked a lot about establishing a relationship with God, but how can you have any kind of a relationship with someone you don\u2019t talk to? Through prayer and meditation we improve our conscious contact with God.\nPrayer is simply talking to God. In Steps 4-7 we were honest with ourselves, and turned to God for His help. Working through the steps, that greater power we have relied on is not just a transcendent being, someone who is unreachable, unknowable and uninterested in our recovery. When we get to the point where we surrender and rely wholly on God, we are ready to move forward into Step 11.\nThis passage shows that the person\u2019s relationship with God is a daily undertaking, that he is completely surrendered to God\u2019s leading and knows that God is always with him. In Psalm 25:4-5, the writer is asking God to show him His way.\nTrusting in God, and not yourself, implies a close relationship and the surrender that opens us up to God\u2019s leading.\nThe Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book offers some insight into this interesting journey. \u201cIn thinking about our day we are faced with indecision. We may not be able to determine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. We are often surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this for a while. (page 86)\u201d As the relationship grows, through prayer and meditation, the wisdom of God is channeled back and what we used to think was a good guess or a good idea, becomes a regular occurrence. We are open to the leading of God.\n\u201cSo I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened\u201d (Luke 11:9-10).\nEven in our indecision, God knows our needs and is ready to help. Once you are learning to communicate daily with God you\u2019re ready for the twelve and final step of your journey: When you have complete Addiction Step Eleven go to Step 12.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T18:19:42Z", "url": "https://www.drug-addiction-support.org/addiction-step-eleven.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The event was located at the Stone Quarry Hill Art Park in Cazenovia, New York and hosted by the Cazenovia Counterpoint. The Stone Quarry Hill Art Parks grounds are open daily from dawn to dusk and has unique outdoor art throughout the 104 acres.

Abend is a small woman with a big personality. She has spent the last four decades creating her wonderful sculptures. Some of her favorite tools are the welding torch, plasma cutters, vices and grinders.\nI found her large sculptures captivating and thought-provoking. Her story of overcoming challenges was inspiring to me and I was very happy to watch the film by Courtney Rile. Abend worked as an artist in the field of metal work which was pretty much dominated by men. She was not deterred but forged ahead with new ideas and techniques. She has great enthusiasm which motivates me to continue on with my art.\nIf you are in the area, I would invite you to stop in at the Stone Quarry Art Park to walk some trails, look at some art and then head into town to visit some of the great little shops and restaurants in Cazenovia.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T05:11:36Z", "url": "https://katieturnerartblog.wordpress.com/tag/sculpture/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The presentation will provide an overview of academic literature from a range of disciplines, which have considered the role and positions of athletes, women and lesbians in and around sport media; the academic debate will be supported and challenged through empirical illustrations from two contemporary lesbian athletes and their portrayal in the media. Specifically, the cases of Casey Stoney and Megan Rapinoe two openly gay female elite soccer players who have played professionally and represented their respective national teams. The two athletes are a similar age and have a similar experience in terms of the media, political and cultural time periods and the comparison builds upon other trans-Atlantic comparative media studies. The presentation will acknowledge the historical context, academic literature and contemporary empirical illustrations will provide an opportunity to support and challenge the burgeoning debate around lesbian athletes in the media, in particular, around the themes of: ambivalence, scrutiny and invisibility of the athletes or their sexuality. Additionally, it will analyse the assumptions that the media portrays lesbian athletes and their sexual identity through: contradictory ideas, critical observations and ignorance will be substantively explored. This presentation will examine the current debates around women in the sporting media before linking it with sexuality. The discussion on women sport and media will predominately be based on print media (which can consumed online) rather than social media.

{"text": "L'Enfant Gallery at the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and P Street NW.\nIn 2000, when Peter Colasante decided to move in, the once-elegant storefront on the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and P Street, formerly an Italian men\u2019s shop, was boarded up. The art gallery he was relocating from Connecticut Avenue was named for architect and engineer Pierre Charles L\u2019Enfant (Colasante didn\u2019t consider the 1960s office complex\u2014L\u2019Enfant Plaza\u2014a fitting tribute to the designer of the District of Columbia).\nColasante, 67, is still pleased with his choice of location, calling Georgetown \u2014 outside of New York, which he says is \u201ca different universe\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe best place in the best city in the country to be.\u201d The gallery\u2019s window displays, meant to be \u201cvisual out-of-the-box experiences,\u201d draw in the avenue\u2019s enviable foot traffic. \u201cI find out who they are later,\u201d he says.\nBy now, the gallery has an international network of clients, a \u201cnuclear family.\u201d Dealers look to L\u2019Enfant Gallery for Chinese art and Asian ceramics, and the Civil War is a focus (Colasante lent items to a major Lincoln exhibition recently), but the overall mix is eclectic in genre, origin and price.\nStepping inside, visitors face a red wall of paintings hung salon-style, assorted chandeliers above. That sense of rich surprise extends throughout the gallery\u2019s four levels.\nIn November, after a volunteer archivist went through what was in storage, Colasante opened the gallery\u2019s basement to the public. It is now set up to resemble a Victorian viewing parlor, complete with a carved chief\u2019s throne from Borneo.\nHaving decamped for Vienna, Virginia, Colasante no longer gets up at 3 in the morning to move paintings around. But he and his business partner (and former spouse) Maureen Taylor rearrange the display and host special exhibitions every few months. From total holdings of roughly 4,000 objects, he says they sell 200 to 300 per year.\nColasante\u2019s eyes twinkle behind stylish frames when he recalls starting out with a much smaller inventory. In December of 1973, he opened Calvert Gallery in an English basement on Connecticut Avenue, putting four things purchased at apartment sales in the window. The gallery grew as it moved from one location to another in the vicinity of Connecticut and Calvert, becoming L\u2019Enfant Gallery in 1990.\nRaised in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, Colasante attended Catholic University, where he failed to shine, as he tells it, either as an actor or a philosopher. He learned about art working in Oxon Hill, Maryland, as an eccentric collector\u2019s cataloguer, then curator. His boss\u2019s advice: Never specialize.\nColasante can remember three recessions, but calls the last five years \u201cthe worst it\u2019s ever been.\u201d The threshold for bread-and-butter purchases, formerly $10,000, has dropped to $3,000, he says. The good news is that he owns his building, having finally been able to purchase it from a trust in 2012. He also does appraisal work and counsels owners of art and antiques (he advises those wishing to hang on to treasured possessions to avoid the three Ds: death, divorce and downsizing).", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T09:05:44Z", "url": "https://georgetowner.com/articles/2016/02/18/sense-rich-surprise-lenfant-gallery/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "If you\u2019re a fan of fantasy-themed games, you\u2019ll no doubt be very much enchanted by the Novomatic release, \u2018Secret Forest\u2019. It\u2019s full of fairy, elf and gnome magic, providing players with a transportation to another world. It\u2019s a little unfortunate that the interface is set up to include much of what would be considered a traditional slot machine cabinet, otherwise the developer could have had some fun with providing a foliage-based background and surroundings. However, this is not the biggest mishap with this game. Instead, they still haven\u2019t seen the error of their ways, and have seen fit to incorporate their tired old arcade noises into this every time the reels spin. Audio should be concentrated on as well as the visuals, and it just seems like Novomatic haven\u2019t really bothered thinking about it too much. However, with this nuance put aside, Secret Forest offers up an easy and relaxing game to play.\nThere are a total of five reels in this game, and these are accompanied by three rows, which presents a standard layout for frequent online video slots players. Upon these reels, various icons relating to the game\u2019s theme can be found, including a griffin, a blonde-haired fairy, a golden-horned unicorn, trees with faces, white-spotted toadstools, two gnomes and a regal castle. Furthermore, the addition of A, J, Q, K, 9 and 10 icons can also be seen. These icons are wonderfully animated and very intricately designed, providing a very visually appealing product.\nIn addition to these reels and rows, Novomatic have added a total of nine separate pay lines. All of these are able to be easily altered, ranging from a single one up to three, five, seven and the maximum of nine. Furthermore, the value of a single credit in the game can be changed between $0.50 and up to $1 and finally, $2. Also, players are also able to change around the bet placed per line, which will range from its minimum of one and increase up to the maximum of 100. Overall, players are able to place a maximum wager per round of $900.\nA large amount of features are usually added in to the best games, and while Secret Forest does have a few, it\u2019s not overwhelmed by them. Its specialities start off with its wild icon, and this is represented by the previously mentioned blonde-haired fairy. She will act as a substitute for all other icons on the reels, except for the scatters, and in doing so, will contribute towards providing a winning combination. Not only that, but she\u2019ll also double the pay out of any winnings.\nIn addition to this, you\u2019ll be able to see a scatter icon in view, which is represented by the trees with faces. Should you manage to spin three or more of these into any location on the reels, you\u2019ll be rewarded with 15 freespins. During this round, any pay outs will be tripled and freespins can be re-triggered as well.\nNovomatic have also added their regular gamble feature to the game, which provides all players with the opportunity to try and increase their winnings. It is triggered after every winning round during the main game, and will offer you up the possibility of playing a side game to do so. Should you choose to do this, you will be taken to a new screen. This will present you with a deck of playing cards, and you will need to guess the colour of the next playing card to be turned over. If you manage to do this correctly, you will see your winnings doubled.

{"text": "Ron Kroichick July 21, 2016 Updated: July 21, 2016 7:54 p.m.\nCurry offered a half-amused glare in return. That one hurt.\nBarely a month after his team fell to the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, completing a shocking collapse from a 3-1 series lead, Curry made a very public appearance. He played 18 holes with four amateur partners in advance of this year\u2019s American Century Championship, the celebrity golf tournament starting Friday alongside Lake Tahoe.\nCurry invited The Chronicle to tag along and chat occasionally as he walked the emerald-green fairways on a breathtakingly gorgeous day.\nThree things became clear: The Finals loss still haunts him; he worried about needing surgery on his troublesome knee and ankle; and he\u2019s confident the Warriors will blend recently signed free agent Kevin Durant into the lineup, after a brief transition.\n\u201cI think about it all the time,\u201d Curry said of the Finals. \u201cIt\u2019s a frustrating feeling to not get the job done. But at the end of the day, for us to kind of keep that in our memory bank as we go forward will make us better.\nCurry looked spry as he smacked long tee shots around Edgewood, a picturesque tree-lined course. No limping, no hesitation, no sign of lingering trouble in the wake of knee and ankle injuries during the playoffs.\nMake no mistake: Those injuries limited his mobility in the Finals. That was plain to see. Curry lacked his customary explosiveness, and the Cavaliers \u2014 most notably Irving, their dynamic point guard \u2014 took full advantage. Irving scored 26 points in Game 7, including a key late three-pointer over Curry.\nCaddie Bryant Barr and Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry talk things over during the 2016 American Century Celebrity-Amateur Tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, California, on Thurs. July 22, 2016. His caddie Bryant Barr, (right) was his roommate back in their college days at Davidson.\nTo his credit, Curry didn\u2019t use the injuries as an excuse. He didn\u2019t Thursday, either, but he acknowledged fearing he might need surgery after the Finals. That\u2019s the main reason he reluctantly skipped joining the U.S. Olympic team as it prepares for next month\u2019s Summer Games in Brazil.\nThursday\u2019s outing represented the first time Curry offered his take on Durant\u2019s rock-the-league decision to join the Warriors. Curry was part of the recruiting delegation to visit Durant in the Hamptons, hoping to persuade the sought-after free agent from Oklahoma City to sign with Golden State.\nGolden State Warriors' Stephen Curry signs autographs during the 2016 American Century Celebrity-Amateur Tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, California, on Thurs. July 22, 2016.\nA few days later, on the morning of July 4, Curry woke up on vacation in Hawaii to discover his phone lighting up. Durant had left a voice mail. Draymond Green and other teammates had sent text messages.\nBut the first text Curry opened was from Warriors owner Joe Lacob. Curry figured Lacob was offering consolation, but then he read the message and realized Durant was now his teammate.\nThe weirdness will morph into a tantalizing challenge come training camp, as the Warriors try to spread shots among Curry, Durant and Klay Thompson. And maybe a few for Green, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a transition,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say guys will have to sacrifice \u2014 I want guys to be who they are, because that\u2019s what makes us so powerful. But there\u2019s a transition in how we see the game, how we see the floor, how the flow goes.\nBefore the Warriors embark on that quest, Curry waded into his new reality at Edgewood. The last time he played in this tournament, in 2013, he was not yet a two-time Most Valuable Player. The Warriors had not yet won the NBA title.\nCurry was popular, but he wasn\u2019t quite Steph Curry.\nSo the person with the biggest job Thursday probably was Ralph Walker, the retired Oakland police officer who serves as Curry\u2019s personal chief of security. Curry patiently signed hundreds and hundreds of autographs, while Walker helped him make his way between holes.\nThe circus was on full display. Several young women screamed in unison on No. 9, asking Curry to pose for a photo. He cleverly stopped, shouted \u201cPhotobomb!\u201d and spread his arms wide with a big smile, appearing in the background of their shot.\nLater, fans on the beach alongside No. 17 threw a football, Frisbee and Warriors hat for Curry to sign. He complied on all three counts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of chaotic, man,\u201d he said.\nAnd, no, it wasn\u2019t nearly as chaotic three years ago in Tahoe. Back then, Curry and a small group of family and friends went out for pizza and a movie to celebrate daughter Riley\u2019s first birthday. Few people bothered them.\nWednesday night\u2019s scene provided a striking contrast. Curry, his dad, Dell, caddie/college roommate Bryant Barr and Walker stopped at Safeway on the way back to their rental house.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T06:14:24Z", "url": "https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Steph-Curry-draws-a-crowd-at-Tahoe-golf-tourney-8401983.php", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "For families with housing vouchers in St. Louis, even the threat of budget cuts means dramatic consequences. For people on the waitlist, it\u2019s even worse.\nAdeena Crape may be one of the last people in St. Louis to receive a housing voucher\u2014at least for a while.\nCrape received a call late this past November from the Housing Authority. Upon learning she could pick up her voucher, she was taken aback. Years had passed since Crape put her name on the waitlist. She had dismissed the idea that a voucher would ever come. \u201cI'm not even sure how I got it!\u201d Crape says.\nCrape applied the last time the St. Louis Housing Authority opened its waitlist\u2014a fleeting five-day window in July 2014. Over the course of those five days, 27,708 residents of St. Louis put their names on the list. In other major cities, the demand for vouchers is just as extraordinary. The last time Chicago opened its waitlist for housing aid, 260,000 households applied. With that many people in the pool, the Chicago Housing Authority held a random lottery, advancing only one in every five families to the voucher waitlist. Nationwide, around 3 million families are on voucher waitlists. If the waitlists weren\u2019t closed, the number might be as high as 9 million families.\nIn the coming months, Congress will make decisions that may dramatically shape Crape\u2019s monthly housing payments, and possibly even her status as a voucher holder. With budget cuts looming, public housing authorities across the country are preparing to shrink their Housing Choice Voucher programs. Philosophically, staff in St. Louis and elsewhere will have to decide on the lesser of two evils: cut the number of vouchers or slash the value that vouchers provide.\nToday, the St. Louis Housing Authority is working its way through the waitlist chronologically\u2014and they have yet to review applicants who signed up after day one of that five-day reprieve back in 2014. That Crape spent years on the waitlist is strikingly typical. According to HUD, 35 percent of voucher holders spend more than three years on waitlists\u2014and 15 percent spend more than five years waiting. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s so hard out here. I know people on the waitlist 10 years, 8 years, 6 years,\u201d Crape says.\nSt. Louis\u2019s long line to a voucher is a testament to the pent-up demand for affordable housing.\nNationwide, only one out of every four eligible households receive support. For those without assistance, conditions are worsening; between 2013 and 2015, HUD reports, the number of severely rent-burdened households increased by more than half a million.\nAgainst this backdrop, federal allocations are positioned to shrink services, shifting the costs to the individual. Cuts will disproportionately burden black women. In St. Louis, black people account for 94 percent of voucher holders. More than 80 percent are women-headed homes. For a city where almost a quarter of renters spend 50 percent or more of their income on housing, fewer federal dollars would mean more residents fighting housing insecurity.\nReceiving a voucher does not necessarily ensure that recipients will be able to obtain safe, affordable housing. Folks like Crape are already navigating a rental landscape in St. Louis in which housing stock is increasingly limited and landlords regularly discriminate against voucher holders, despite the fact that this practice is illegal within city limits. Further, just last year during budget negotiations, more than a thousand vouchers nationwide were rescinded while families attempted to secure units, sending them back to the waitlist.\nCheryl Lovell, the executive director of the St. Louis Housing Authority, administers vouchers to just under 7,000 households in the city and neighboring county. Just before the new year, HUD notified housing authorities of possible budget cuts based on Congressional proposals. The letter told directors to anticipate anywhere from a one to five percent cut in voucher program funding. \u201cI know our funding is going to go down, but I don't know by how much,\u201d Lovell says.\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that, under the last Senate bill, 25,000 households nationwide would drop off the voucher program in a year\u2014this, even though the bill increases HUD\u2019s overall funding. The House bill is significantly harsher, cutting an estimated 105,000 households from the program. Put into further perspective, the budget Trump gave to Congress would cut around 235,000 households nationwide as part of the largest proposed cut to HUD since the Reagan era.\nWhile waiting for last year\u2019s budget to pass, Lovell says industry groups predicted that funding would renew only 95 percent of her budget. The 5 percent gap would have been enough to create a small crisis, had it materialized. Given the uncertainty, Lovell was forced into the precarious position of cutting her own program.\nTo mitigate the potential damage, the Housing Authority\u2019s Board of Commissioners decided to cut costs. They froze the waitlist for the first time since a nearly two-year period in 2014, meaning no names would come off the waitlist when vouchers became available. \u201cOur first reaction, if the money gets cut substantially, is to just stop leasing to new tenants,\u201d says Lovell.\nOnce the office stopped providing vouchers to applicants from the waitlist, attrition reduced the program. \u201cThirty-five to 40 households will fall off the program every month, and you hope that this makes up for the money that you've lost.\u201d By not replacing these spots with families from the waitlist, Lovell\u2019s program can be reduced by about 450 vouchers in a given year, if needed to fill a budget gap.\nWhen the federal budget passed in May 2017, the St. Louis voucher program received more funding than expected. Still, the waitlist remained frozen for three months after the budget passed. \u201cThe leasing process itself takes a fairly long time to gear back up\u2014so you stop and you start,\u201d Lovell says. An uncertain budget increases inefficiencies.\nThe line Lovell walks was especially thin in 2013. That year, a gridlocked Congress triggered the across-the-board budget cut known as the sequester. As a result, housing authorities nationwide faced a 6 percent gap in voucher funding.\nWhen housing authorities run out of other options, they sometimes turn to watering down the payment standard, or value, of vouchers. Payment standards are the maximum amount of subsidy a household can receive. When payment standards go down, tenants have a harder time making ends meet. Plus, their pool of available units is further restricted.\nFor households moving between homes in St. Louis during the summer of 2013, the support they received plummeted. The Housing Authority\u2019s idea was to reduce each voucher holder\u2019s support just enough to avoid knocking anyone off the program. Instead of receiving vouchers worth 110 percent of an area\u2019s fair market rent (the maximum), their vouchers\u2019 values sank to 95 percent. Vouchers no longer stretched as far. For example, in fiscal year 2013, a voucher for a two-bedroom unit within the city covered up to $871 of rent and utilities. Under these new payment standards and the 2013 budget, only up to $788 would be covered.\n\u201cThis shifts more costs onto low-income households, who either must pay more to remain in their current housing or move to lower cost, lower quality housing,\u201d writes Douglas Rice, senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. As a result, in St. Louis, fewer families were able to move out of the region\u2019s high-poverty areas, where vouchers are already concentrated within lines of racial segregation. Policy changes fenced them in: The Housing Authority denied all tenant requests to move to homes in higher-cost areas. This, despite the program\u2019s promise in increasing residents\u2019 choices.\nIn May 2013, the housing authority sent a letter outlining program cutbacks to landlords, appealing to their goodwill. Staff, bracing for cuts, planned to decrease payment standards for all tenants, thereby increasing rent burden, with as little as 30 days warning. The letter asked landlords to voluntarily defer rent increases and reduce rent by 5 percent. Lovell admits, \u201cThese two attempts to reduce cost were not very successful.\u201d Only two landlords deferred rent increases. No landlords reduced rent.\nWhen facing cuts, even housing authorities are less likely to meet tenants half way. Leeway within programs\u2014such as a payment plan for shifting income\u2014can make the difference between a family keeping and losing their voucher. \u201cBut when you're trying to control the cost and get under this cap, all the nice things you do for people, you're just like, \u2018Nope, sorry, can't do that anymore,\u2019\u201d Lovell says. Cuts to administrative funding over recent years have compounded the shrinking support that housing authorities provide to tenant-landlord relations.\nAnd while budget uncertainty diminished the voucher program\u2019s pledge of social mobility, it didn\u2019t undermine it completely. St. Louis avoided the most extreme scenario: not a single voucher was taken from a family following this budget cut. For many housing authorities nationwide it was a closer call, with tenants\u2019 livelihoods often hanging in the balance. \u201cWe do everything else before we do that, everything. We do not want to remove a family,\u201d Lovell says. But if it has to happen, the rule is simple: Last in, first out.\nToday, housing authorities everywhere, St. Louis city included, have narrower margins and shallower emergency funds than they did following sequestration. This makes the worst-case scenario\u2014housing authorities revoking vouchers\u2014all the more likely if the Trump administration succeeds in imposing radical austerity.\nWith uncertain cuts looming and an administration that is anxious to dramatically reduce housing support, Crape occupies the position of \u201clast in.\u201d Any future cost-cutting measures in St. Louis will be made in an attempt to keep her, and other households recently awarded vouchers, in their homes.\nCaitlin Lee writes, researches, and designs in St. Louis, Missouri.\nClark Randall is a freelance writer based in St. Louis, Missouri.

These shows tend to be 50-50 as a translation into acceptable viewing, I find. 50% worth a look and 50% worth avoiding like the black plague.\nThe show I saw was this one, and truthfully, I found it quite entertaining and informative.

Looking back at previous lineups it seems the three pollies-plus-boofhead is usually evident, at least.\nI\u2019m writing about this program to alert bloggers to the upcoming edition of QANDA this Thursday, 26 June. The line up is one not to be missed because Timmy Blair will be making a rare appearance on the ABC, television no less.

Timmy Blair surrounded by two up-and-coming politically astute and aware politicians, the Director of the Museum of Contemporary Art and spokesperson for a somewhat closeted conservative thinktank.

{"text": "Viking Ocean Cruises, which two weeks ago pulled an order for ocean-going cruise ships from a French shipyard, now plans to build the ships at the Italian yard Fincantieri.

It has not been determined whether the vessels will be built in the company\u2019s Venice or Genoa shipyards.\nThe 45,000-ton, 998-passenger ships are scheduled for delivery in late 2014 and late 2015.

The Texans love drafting tight ends and Griffin found himself buried behind Owen Daniels and Garrett Graham. With Daniels going down after the 5th game, Griffin saw more active playing time behind Graham. When Griffin was out there, he provided a respectable option for the Texans\u2019 ragged quarterback rotation. Viewed as a poor-man\u2019s Daniels, Griffin logged 19 receptions (on 28 targets) for 244 yards, scoring his first professional TD against the Arizona Cardinals.\nAs the Texans cleaned house after the 2013 season and new coach Bill O\u2019Brien bringing in his multiple offensive system, Daniels was allowed to sign via free agency with the Ravens. Graham was elevated to starter and Griffin was relegated to third string again behind new arrival CJ Fiedorciwz. Still Griffin started 2 games and made 10 receptions. He scored his second professional TD in the Texans 45-21 blow out of the Tennessee Titans.\nWhile the selection of Griffin and Brandon Brooks met with a collective disappointed sigh from the autograph community- I relished it, because it ensured that the event would still be a draw for the true fans. I quickly bought out what Ryan Griffin cards I could and prepared for the event the following month. It was really difficult to locate cards of him that were not already autographed, or were of Ryan Griffin (QB Tulane). In the end I paid more for unautographed cards, but that\u2019s just what a true type of collector I am.\nThe players were really accommodating at the event. They signed a multiple for me and threw in the photographed memorabilia to boot. While Academy didn\u2019t hand out numbers for the event beforehand, it wasn\u2019t necessary. There were just not that many people there. Overall everything went well, and I was able to talk to some fellow fans as well while I waited.\nBoth of these cards really hit the mark pretty well. I like the Crown Royale a lot- even if it is a bit over the top. The set in general integrates the crown icon and design very well into the player image. Overall, it\u2019s a very nice presentation and as a bonus, the scans came out even better than the actual cards. The Panini Black is okay. Again I am just not a huge fan of blasting a card brand across the card, but still it is a solid image. Ryan has a pretty solid autograph. There are some nice loops in the name and its angular slant gives it an exciting feel.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T06:45:36Z", "url": "http://lee.n8d.com/2016/griffin-ryan/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "\u2022 Fresh Dog \u2122 Dry Shampoo: If you\u2019ve ever used a dry shampoo on your own hair, you know it works by absorbing the oil and dirt from your scalp, leaving your hair looking like it\u2019s just been washed. Fresh Dog's dry shampoo does basically the same thing for your dog. It is a loose powder that you sprinkle directly onto your dog's coat for an instantly clean and freshen appearance.\nWhen applying the product, I found it best to sprinkle a small amount at a time, as using too much at once can cause a cloud of powder. I started at the base of the neck, sprinkling a bit of powder and massaging it in. I continued adding a bit more powder as needed, working my way down the back. A little powder goes a long way and my Schnauzer really enjoyed the massage. Note: I did not apply any product to the face, just to the body and legs.\nWhen I finished applying the product to the areas I wanted to cover, I took a soft bristle brush and brushed my dog out. This helped to distribute the powder even further and removed the excess along with small bits of dirt.\nI actually applied the powder to my dog while in the backyard. Since it was my first time trying out this type of product, I wasn\u2019t sure if the process would be messy or not. It wasn\u2019t. I did notice that my dog\u2019s coat appeared whiter, so dogs with a black coat might need a bit more brushing.\nThe dry shampoo powder is easy-to-use and smells, well\u2026 fresh! The powder is infused with essential oils and has a marvelous lavender rosemary scent. I even deodorized my Schnauzer\u2019s dog bed by sprinkling some onto it, too. It just smells so good. The dry shampoo powder is a good product to use as a quick way to remove odors and freshen up your dog's coat.\n\u2022 Fresh Dog \u2122 Waterless Foam Bath: If your Schnauzer is in need of a bath but you just don\u2019t have the time to do it, this waterless bath foam will solve your problem. Why it\u2019s a bath in a bottle and no water needed!\nJust dispense a few pumps of foam in the palm of your hand and distribute over your dog, taking special care not to get any into the eyes. Massage the foam fully into your dog's coat to loosen and break away any dirt and oils. Then towel dry your dog off... That's It!\nMy Schnauzer did not object to the foam bath at all and in fact, pranced around like \"I got it going on\" when we were done. I think he was just as happy as I was that he was clean and smelling fresh.\nI really like this product. There was no sticky residue and it smells great. I've tried squirt-on waterless shampoos before, but this foam bath is way better. The foam is thicker and richer and distributes the cleaning agent much more effectively, so you end up using less of it.\nnote: Although it is a waterless shampoo, the foam itself does dampen your dog's coat, but you do not need to rinse it out. Just allow the product to do its magic.\nOnce you towel dry your dog, it dries quickly and leaves the coat super soft and smelling great! I loved it!\nYour dog hates regular baths but could really use one about now.\nYour dog has been sick or is recovering from surgery and could use some spot cleaning.\nYou have an older or arthritic dog that has a hard time getting in and out of the tub.\nYou have company coming over and just no time to give your dog(s) a regular bath.\nYou have a multi-dog household and regular bath day becomes an all day job that's a nightmare.\nIt's great for cleaning dogs during those cold winter months.\nIt's a great product to carry along on trips or outings, just in case your dog gets into a smelly situation.\nIt's safe for dogs and puppies over 6 weeks of age.\nFor those who normally bathe their dogs at home: This no mess, no fuss, no back-breaking foam bath is easy to do and allows you to put off having to give your dog the traditional bath so often.\nFor those who usually take their dog to a groomer: Extends the time in-between regular visits to the dog groomer, thereby saving you time and money $$.\nSo for a great alternative to regular shampoos and the dreaded task of giving your dog a bath, try Fresh Dog \u2122! It will leave your dog's coat smelling fresh and clean.\nHow would you like to try out Fresh Dog on your Miniature Schnauzer... for FREE?\nThanks to the good folks at Fresh Dog, one lucky winner will win the set of shampoos to freshen up their own dog(s).\nPrizes: The Happy Dog Bundle - Both innovative dog shampoo products which include (1) 12oz dry shampoo powder and (1) 6oz bottle of the waterless bath foam. A $27 value.\nJust post a comment below, like: I want a Fresh Dog!\nA winner will be chosen at random from those who post a comment below on Friday May 18, 2012.

In the space of three months we lost my mother and both her parents.\nSince that time, as a Hampshire Photographer I have been looking for something that would help with the grieving process. It was about 2years ago when I met a photographer who occasionally compiled slideshows for a funeral director. We spoke and the conversation that I had sparked my interest. I undertook some research and with the help of a few friends I decided to add this to my business.\nWhat benefit could this be?\nCelebration of Life slideshows are about paying tribute to an individual by celebrating their life. It\u2019s using the images and or video taken over a lifetime adding a soundtrack of music or spoken word and displaying the slideshow at a family and friends gathering. The gathering could be a funeral wake, golden wedding celebration, a retirement, significant birthday, wedding and I am sure that you can think of a few more.\nA Celebration of Life slideshow brings together the images/video that have been stored in a box, a book, on a pc hard drive and gives the opportunity to share those memorable moments with others. People can rediscover those forgotten moments, to learn of moments unknown but above all to remember the times that we were spent in that persons company.\nThe slideshow can be watched time and time again. It is a lasting memory that forms part of the family tree and can be handed down to the younger generations, leaving a legacy of what has passed and who people were.\nAre you thinking of how you can leave a legacy, then contact Martin and talk to him about having a slideshow commissioned for you.\nGreen Screen Photography is the use of a green or blue backdrop it allows the use of any background that you or the client wants behind them. The news use this process for the weather.\nTo begin with a green/blue background is placed behind the subject. The subject needs to be placed about six feet from the background (helps minimize color bleed). As a minimum of two studio light are used to light the subject (but no hair light), these are set roughly at 45\u00b0 either side of the subject and about six feet in front of them. This is to evenly light the subject and produce minimum shadow.\nSet the lights to your preferred light setting then you are ready to start photographing.\nSubject against a green background.\nIn the first place to create your masterpiece, the image(s) need to be processed in photo software. Load your image(s) into the software and process to your preferred RAW settings (you are using RAW) and it\u2019s in editing space of Photoshop then the magic begins.\nIn the first place use the select-colour range. When the box appears use sampled colours (top of box), quick mask (bottom of box) and tick the invert box. Next use the left eyedropper to sample the green in the image. At this stage the green will turn orange. Keep using the eyedropper to pick the green background until it is all orange. It is important not to use the eyedropper on the subject. If you have a space between an arm and body this will change to orange as you click the green background.\nOnce you have an orange background slide the fuzziness slider to the right to ensure that all the background orange is similar. Click the OK button, the orange disappears and this leaves you with marching ants around the subject.\nNext click select-fine edge and the refine edge box appears. In view mode, select a white background. Next tick smart radius and set the slider to 30. Next adjust the smooth slider to 15, tick the Output decontaminate colors and move the slider to 70. Set the output to new layer with layer mask. Now use the refine radius tool (next to the edge detection and choose by right clicking), set the brush size to about 78 and go around the hair. Once you have completed this click OK, this leaves you with the subject visible and no background.\nNow you need to click on the layer mask, set the mode above the mask to overlay. Select the brush tool, set this to overlay and brush opacity to 20%. Go around the hair, you will notice a slight shrinkage (try at 100% if you want to see it happen). 20% just adjusts slightly however you may still have a green color on the hair and possibly clothes.\nThe next step is to click, create new layer button. When the new layer appears in the layer stack, right click to the right of the layer and click create clipping mask (a little left hand bent arrow appears). Go to the blend mode above and click hue, then select the brush tool. At the top of the editing space you select Normal in the mode box and 100% opacity.\nPut the cursor over the hair in the area you want the green to disappear. Use the alt keyboard button to select that area of hair, now brush over the area next to this and watch the green disappear. Continue doing this on the rest of the hair. If you have a green tinge on white clothing then use the same method. Once complete all of the green tinge should now be gone in the image. You can now introduce your new background as a new layer, you may have to move the layer down the stack.\nThat\u2019s how simple it is. Now it\u2019s time to experiment.\nUsing Photoshop to remove the green tinge around the hair.\nWant to find out more, contact Martin and see what can be achieved.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T05:54:20Z", "url": "https://www.mhphotographyhampshire.co.uk/2014/10/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

For the 14th year in a row, North Korea is top of the list; followed by Iraq, Eritrea, Afghanistan, Syria, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan and Iran.\nThe north east African reclusive State of Eritrea has entered the top five for the first time.\n\u201cReligious extremism \u2013 Islamic, Hindu and Buddhist \u2013 is the greatest source of persecution of Christians,\u201d says Open Doors, while noting that \u201cgender violence is a weapon of persecution: women and girls are on the frontline.\u201d.\nOpen Doors records show that worldwide there were over 7,000 Christians killed for faith-related reasons in the year \u2013 almost 3,000 more than the previous year.\nIt says its estimates exclude North Korea, Syria and Iraq, where accurate records do not exist.\nAround 2,400 churches were attacked or damaged \u2013 over double the number for last year. In terms of violence against Christians and Christian property, Nigeria and Central African Republic topped the list.\nOne of its key findings is that never before have so many Christians been on the move.\nThe entry of India, often referred to as the world\u2019s biggest democracy, into the top 20 most dangerous place at17 is a first.\nOpen Doors says, \u201cPersecution in India is extremely violence \u2013 and the violence is increasing.\n\u201cMore than 350 Christians were physically attacked, at least nine Christians were killed for their faith and at least three women were raped in the reporting year.\n\u201cAttacks mainly come from Hindu extremists, although extremist Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists and Maoists have all targeted Christians.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T16:18:41Z", "url": "http://www.christianmessenger.in/india-17th-in-most-dangerous-place-for-christians/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "It\u2019s vital that everyone, from fishers to retailers, scientists to consumers, has confidence in the blue MSC label and the credibility of the claims made by MSC certified organisations.\nBelow we have detailed the safeguards we put in place to ensure confidence in the MSC label. Collectively, these safeguards make up what we call the MSC assurance system. This system is used to make sure the assessment process for fisheries and supply chain businesses is working and meets best practice.\nAdditionally, our Fisheries and Chain of Custody Standards, which fisheries and businesses are assessed against, are compliant with international benchmarking bodies.\nUnder the MSC program, fisheries can get certified if they meet the MSC Fisheries Standard.\nThe MSC operates a third-party certification program. This means we do not assess or certify fisheries.\nFishery assessments are carried out by teams of auditors who are experts in fisheries science and management and are independent of the fishery and the MSC. The certification process is managed by an independent conformity assessment body (also known as a CAB).\nThe MSC, in consultation with stakeholders, sets standards for sustainable fisheries and supply chains. The independent assessments are carried out by the CABs, following specific processes that are also set by MSC.\nThis third-party system means consumers can be confident that the outcomes of assessments are free from the influence of either the client or the MSC.\nThird-party certification is widely regarded as the most trustworthy system for objective assessments. However, there can still be risks to the integrity of the system \u2013 such as real or perceived conflicts of interest \u2013 and these must be mitigated.\nThere are multiple opportunities for stakeholders to contribute to specific fishery assessments. This helps to ensure assessments are balanced, evidence-based and reflect all available information.\nIf stakeholders have an issue with the way an assessment has been carried out, they can raise official objections or complaints.\nFor a fishery to become certified, an assessment team reviews all the evidence received during the assessment process.\nThis includes evidence from the fishery, a site visit with staff interviews, input from stakeholders during the site visit and submitted in writing, and independent scientific input including from peer reviewers.\nAssessment teams can be part of a CAB, or they can be hired by a CAB to complete specific assessments.\nCABs also have further assurance systems in place. For example, assessors must submit their reports to the CAB for further review. A second qualified person within the CAB takes the final decision on whether to certify a fishery.\nTo ensure the consistency, independence and impartiality of the MSC fishery certification process, all fishery assessment reports are peer-reviewed by independent scientists.\nFor example, the scientists might comment on the scores a fishery received, or on any information that seems to be missing in the CAB\u2019s rationale for the scoring. Any issues raised by the peer reviewers must be considered and responded to by the CAB.\nThe MSC strengthened the peer review process by formally establishing an independent Peer Review College from 1 September 2017, following an 18-month pilot phase.\nThe College currently includes around 90 experts in marine science and fisheries management, enabling each assessment to be checked by members with expertise in the relevant field, and without a conflict of interest. The Peer Review College normally assigns two peer reviewers to check each fishery assessment report.\nTo maintain its impartiality and independence, the College has an Oversight Committee that is appointed by the MSC Board of Trustees. Two additional third-party experts also verify the candidates for each review and provide quality assurance.\nProfessor at University of Tasmania, consultant through SainSolutions and Commissioner with the Australian Fishery Management Authority. Expert in fishery assessment and fishery management systems, including ecosystem-based approaches.\nVice-President for Science and board member of the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF). Expert in tuna, large pelagics and Regional Fisheries Management Organisations.\nDeputy Director General, Sustainability and Biosecurity, Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development, Government of Western Australia. Expert on fisheries management systems and national-level engagement with the MSC program.\nPrincipal Research Scientist at the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research. Long experience as Editor-in-Chief of marine and fisheries science journals and expert on best practice in scientific publishing, including ethics.\nChief Scientist-Emeritus, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada. Expert in fisheries science and management, conservation of biodiversity and international policy and governance.\nIndependent consultant, recently retired from the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES), Chair of the ICES Advisory Committee, 2014-2018. Expert on fisheries science and management.\nThe Peer Review College Oversight Committee reviews the performance of the peer review system at least once a year. Peer reviewer\u2019s comments are checked by the third-party experts along with the responses made by the CABs. If any issues are identified, the College can provide targeted training to the reviewers or make changes to improve the system.\nRead more about how we\u2019re maintaining best practice.\nAll companies that buy and sell certified seafood comply with the MSC Chain of Custody Standard. As with fisheries, these companies are certified by a third-party audit.\nThis means all seafood sold with the MSC blue fish label can be traced back to a certified sustainable source. This is important because around 30% of seafood globally is mislabelled. DNA testing has shown that mislabelling rates for MSC labelled seafood are less than 1%.\nA traceable supply chain is necessary to fight seafood fraud. It means consumers can trust that what they are eating really is what it says on the packet.\nOur Chain of Custody Standard set us apart from other sustainable seafood initiatives, such as ratings cards, that don\u2019t guarantee traceability.\nWe go to great lengths to ensure we meet the highest international benchmarks for credible certification and ecolabeling.\nThe MSC Fisheries Standard is based in part on the UN FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing. The Code provides principles and standards for the conservation, management and development of fisheries around the world.\nstandards based on the three factors - sustainability of target species, ecosystems and management practices.\nThe MSC runs the first global certification program for wild caught seafood to be recognised by the Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative (GSSI), an independent benchmark for the credibility of sustainable seafood certification programs. GSSI was developed by a coalition of environmental NGOs, global businesses, industry experts, governments and intergovernmental organisations and is based on UN FAO codes and guidelines.\nThe MSC program meets all the essential components of the GSSI benchmark, and a further 63 supplementary components relating to issues such as deep sea fishing and vulnerable marine ecosystems.\nWe are the only wild seafood certification program to be a full member of ISEAL, the global membership association for credible sustainability standards.\nMonitoring and evaluation is in place to demonstrate the impacts of the program.\nWe're regularly audited to ensure that we meet these codes.\nOther full members of ISEAL include Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade International and the Forest Stewardship Council.\nFor 70 years, the International Standards Organisation (ISO) has published standards for companies and certifiers globally. Over 1 million companies are certified to ISO standards including the standard for quality management (ISO 9001).\nThe following ISO standards are built into the MSC\u2019s assurance system. They define controls on conflict of interest, complaint resolution and accrediting a CAB.\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement exists to ensure standards and regulations do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade. ISEAL has sought a legal opinion from the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL) which confirms that all organisations consistent with the ISEAL Code of Good Practice, are not technical barriers to trade.\nIn addition to meeting international norms and guidelines for best practice, our program is well regarded by numerous international organisations who scrutinise the role of standard setting in safeguarding our oceans.\nThe MSC and other credible standard setters are seen to have a key role to play in helping companies and governments to achieve the United Nations Environment Programme\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals by providing best practice guidance for 'what good looks like' in a specific industry.\nMSC certification is used as an indicator in the UN Convention on Biodiversity\u2019s Aichi Targets. Part of the UN\u2019s decade-long initiative to significantly reduce biodiversity loss by 2020, these targets were widely consulted with the international conservation and governance community.\nJust as we develop our standards in accordance with the latest scientific understanding, we periodically review our entire program.\nThe MSC is currently reviewing the assurance system to increase its effectiveness and address real or perceived issues within the system.\nThe review is focused on key work areas running from 2018-2020.\nAssurance Oversight: The first step is to review the overall assurance system and identify any quick wins. This includes strengthening our training programs, improving our Quality Management System, scrutinising conflict of interest controls and more focus on data monitoring.\nCertification Process Review: In the medium term, we have identified three key areas of the certification process for review: the closing and tracking of conditions, the objections process and dispute resolution mechanism for stakeholders in fisheries assessments. Improving these processes could help ensure fishery assessments are fair and lead to better outcomes.\nStandard Review: On a longer timescale, we are addressing a number of different aspects of the MSC Fisheries Standard through the Fisheries Standard Review.\nThe Marine Stewardship Council is an international non-profit organisation. We recognise and reward efforts to protect oceans and safeguard seafood supplies.\nYou can trust that seafood with the blue MSC label was caught by a responsible fishery in a sustainable way.\nData from the MSC is used by the UN Environment Programme to track progress towards international goals to end overfishing and protect biodiversity.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T06:11:16Z", "url": "https://msc-live.precedenthost.com/about-the-msc/how-we-meet-best-practice", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Wild garlic pesto shrimp pasta is a fresh and easy pasta dish made with sauteed shrimps, marinated in flavourful wild garlic pesto\u2026 Perfect for lunch or dinner!\nLately, I\u2019ve been all about easy and quick lunch and dinner ideas, and this recipe is one of my all-time favourite recipes. This whole thing is ready in just 20 minutes, perfect for busy days or even date nights!\nWild garlic can be found normally from March to June, and since it\u2019s the season of wild garlic I wanted to share this recipe with you. However, if you can\u2019t find wild garlic then you can go for regular basil pesto and the result will also be very delicious!\nWild garlic pesto is very easy to make. You will need wild garlic, grated parmesan cheese, pine nuts, olive oil, lemon juice and salt & pepper. Simply place all ingredients in a food processor and blitz until you get the desired consistency. You can add more olive oil to the mixture if needed.\nThis luxury shrimp pasta dish is very easy and quick to make. It is ready in just 20 minutes, and you can\u2019t beat that! All you need to do is cook the pasta, marinate (or coat if you don\u2019t have time) the shrimp in pesto, saute the shrimp, make a simple creamy sauce for the pasta, toss everything together, top the pasta with shrimps, and finish with a sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese and freshly chopped parsley!\nThis creamy wild garlic pesto shrimp pasta is packed with flavour. Perfect for lunch or dinner and can be ready in under 20 minutes!\nPlace all ingredients in a food processor and blitz until you reach the desired consistency. You can add more olive oil if needed.\nMarinate shrimp in wild garlic pesto for 15-20 minutes. Or just coat in pesto if you don't have much time.\nCook pasta according to instructions on the pack. I add a little bit of olive oil and a pinch of salt to boiling water before adding pasta.\nWhile pasta is cooking, cook the shrimps. Heat olive oil in a pan, then add shrimps and cook until shrimps are pink and round.\nWhen pasta is cooked, get rid of pasta water and leave pasta in the pot. Reserve just a little bit of the water. Add heavy cream along with pasta water, and let it bubble. Add ground black pepper and salt to taste.\nThis shrimp pasta dish is also perfect for date nights, my fiance appreciates a good pasta dish with seafood and this recipe is definitely a favourite. For me, date night at home means cooking a luxury comforting dish and eating it on our cosy sofa with romantic music playing in the background.\nI was asked to take part in a creative challenge by Juliettes Interiors to create a lunch menu inspired by my favourite Chaise Longue from their collection. They have a beautiful glamorous collection, and it was so difficult for me to choose my favourite chaise. There are so many styles to choose from! From neoclassical, baroque and roman to modern designs. And different gorgeous materials and finishes, like leather, linen, velvet, and wood. I ended up going with this stunning Curved Contemporary Chaise Longue. This luxurious chaise is very elegant and looks very comfy as well!\nThis post is sponsored by Juliettes Interiors. Thank you for supporting the brands that make Little Sunny Kitchen happen. All opinions are my own. Chaise Longue image courtesy of Juliettes Interiors.\nThis looks so light and fresh which pasta does not always do. It looks amazing too!\nI absolutely love pasta with wild garlic pesto. I made this recipe for my family yesterday, and it was gone right away.\nI\u2019m not familiar with wild garlic but it sounds like something I need to track down! Pinned, in hopes that I do! I love the whole date night menu you proposed too. So easy and elegant all at once!\nthis is so pretty I love the presentation. Everyone would swoon over me serving something so gourmet they would think someone else did it! Great job!\nI love the sound of that pesto and with the shrimp I\u2019m sure it\u2019s incredible!\nWhat a fantastic dinner so full of flavor! Perfect for a date night in!\nI\u2019m intrigued. I\u2019ve never used wild garlic before and wondering how the flavor differs from regular garlic. I\u2019ll have to hunt it down and check it out!\nThis look easy to make, and will make a great date night dinner with my hubby! Love the pesto recipe and can\u2019t wait to try it!\nThis looks very elegant, and yummy! I can\u2019t wait to make this easy pesto shrimp! The pesto recipe looks really easy to make!\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen wild garlic before. Does it look different from regular garlic? Do you find it in your supermarket?\nIs there anything better than shrimp and pesto? I don\u2019t think so and this looks delicious. I love simple meals like this that I can get on the table quickly during the week!\nI can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t heard of wild garlic before!! I\u2019m such a garlic lover and I\u2019ll definitely need to give this a try!\nI\u2019ve been all about quick and easy dinners recently too! But I don\u2019t want to sacrifice flavour or use pre packaged stuff!

{"text": "Los Angeles Air Force Base is a United States Air Force Base located in El Segundo, California. Los Angeles Air Force Base houses and supports the headquarters of the Air Force Space Command's Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC). The center manages research, development and acquisition of military space systems. The 61st Air Base Wing provides support functions for the base.\nIn 1961, the Air Force developed a plan to consolidate its Space Systems Division and the Research and Development (R&D) Center of The Aerospace Corporation, which had been created in 1960 to support Air Force space programs. The plan involved acquisition of two pieces of real estate adjoining the R&D Center. An aircraft plant owned by the Navy at the northwest corner of Aviation and El Segundo Boulevards, was transferred to the Air Force in October 1962. Another site at the southwest corner of the same intersection, was owned by a mining company. The Aerospace Corporation acquired that site in November 1962 and built its new headquarters there between February 1963 and April 1964. By April 10, 1964, the Air Force property at the intersection of Aviation and El Segundo Boulevards was designated as Los Angeles Air Force Station, which was redesignated as Los Angeles Air Force Base in September 1987.\nIn 2006, Area A of LAAFB was permanently closed after a deal with a local builder to exchange the land in Area A for the creation of the Schriever Space Complex on Area B and other new facilities. In February 2007, a new base exchange opened up on Area B.\nThe portion of Fort MacArthur remaining in military use is a sub-base of Los Angeles Air Force Base serving as a housing and administrative annex.

As new safety Eric Reid gets his legs under him and further comprehends the playbook, his impact should grow.\n\"We have great players in this locker room and we've accepted him with open arms\", Newton said. \"I publicly declared that I didn't agree with his comments and I asked anybody that was interested if they wanted clarification [to] go to Odell because he's a big man\".\nThat's why it shouldn't be a huge surprise when Newton flattened New York Giants linebacker Kareem Martin when the Panthers ran a trick play and Newton turned into a blocker.\nThese are the key players for the Carolina Panthers to secure a win over the New York Giants and to keep pace in the NFC South.\nNow, we don't know whether Bruce was watching these last few plays - but based on how down and out he looks here. we're just gonna say it's very possible.\nNewton is probably the most multitalented quarterback in the NFL. That's not something the Giants are running with the slow-footed Eli Manning at the helm.\n\"I didn't have any cool \"Superman\" celebration like Cam\", Gano said of Newton, who celebrates touchdowns by pretending to reveal the \"S\" on his chest.

{"text": "\"Why am I fat?\" A question I receive daily. You would think the question would be, \"How can I be permanently thin?\" But that's not the case. The majority of the time it's about \"am I too fat\" as opposed to seeking a real and practical solution to the overweight problem.\nThere is no mystery why people are fat. The average American consumes 20% more calories than 20 years ago. The average American will consume approximately 100 calories more per day than they will burn. An energy gap equaling a yearly weight gain of 10.4 pounds.\nReasons and causes of obesity are numerous. Learned behavior, biological, environmental are only a few factors that influence obesity. In my experience, three factors are constant with overweight people -- sedentary lifestyle, chronic dieting and poor eating habits.\nDon't ask, \"Why am I fat?\"\nAsk, \"How can I lose weight and keep it off?\"\nSymptoms of obesity are easily identifiable. For instance, if you don't eat breakfast, you are four times more likely to be overweight than those who do. If you eat at fast food restaurants at least once per day, double your likelihood of an overweight problem. A Harvard University study revealed young people ate 110 to 165 more calories than they burned daily, for ten years, resulting in an average 58 pound weight gain! Approximately 25% of the vegetables consumed by the average American consists of potato chips and french fries.\n\"How can I reach my ideal body weight and maintain it for life?\" My answer is simple. Reduce portions and increase your level of physical activity. Once you reach your ideal weight, when weight loss is no longer an issue, begin to improve the nutritional value of your diet. Repeat daily until you establish automatic subconscious habits. See Sequence of Weight Loss Success for more.\nI always get the feeling when someone asks \"Why am I fat?\", it's because the person is embarrassed. By pretending to not know the causes of obesity, they can not be expected to correct the problem. A simple absolution of responsibility.\nThere is nothing wrong with you! You don't need to feel embarrassed or ashamed of your weight. This is the biggest obstacle to success you must overcome... You! How you feel about yourself.\nYou have not broken any laws. You are not a criminal. If you are a social outcast or living in isolation it's because you choose to do so. Once you understand weight loss is completely in your control, that weight loss is certain because it's guaranteed by your choices, actions, behaviors and attitude -- once you have this epiphany, weight loss is no longer hard, difficult or a mystery.\nThere is no difference between overweight people and naturally thin people. Both want the best for their kids. Both want good jobs and a happy and safe home. The only difference is how the overweight view themselves. This poor self-image is at the very root of the helpless feeling and confusion the overweight have about losing weight.\nCombine poor self-image caused by a society obsessed with \"size 4 syndrome\" with a history of chronic dieting that causes progressive weight gain and a sedentary lifestyle and you have a prescription for life long cascading weight gain and obesity.\nAll of this is so avoidable it breaks my heart. First, you must repair your damaged self-image. Like yourself. Respect yourself. So you've gained weight. You're fat. Big deal. Join the 66% of the entire American population that suffers the same condition. Obesity is the norm in America! So don't allow society to label you an \"out of control outcast.\" Don't buy into the weight loss is a great achievement misconception. Weight loss will be as easy as you make it. As sure as your commitment to it. And I'm telling you the 100% truth when I say you have every resource within you necessary to lose weight and live life free of all weight issues.\nWhy am I fat? Am I too fat? Self-depreciating questions that do not warrant time for consideration. There is no fat quiz or symptoms of obesity that can cause or validate your condition. Losing weight is entirely your responsibility. And that's exactly why your success is certain.\nThe only thing preventing you from living a naturally thin life is you. Overcome that obstacle and you're weight loss success is assured.\nI recommend reviewing 110 Quick Weight Loss Tips and Portion Perversion sections of this web site. If what you read makes sense then read my book, Barb's Foolproof Weight Loss Solution. There's nothing wrong with you! You're special -- act like it!\n20 FACTS ON OBESITY Tip #17--\"Why am I fat?\"\nPeople are fat for a myriad of reasons. However, the question is only relevant if it's asked to discover a problem that you intend to correct. Many ask, \"Why am I fat?\" But what they really want to know is, \"What's wrong with me.\" And the answer is liberating.

{"text": "In a city full of historic hotels, it can be hard to be the new property on the block. But when The Langham, New York, Fifth Avenue debuted in 2013, it found its footing quickly around the Big Apple, distinguishing itself with modern, glamorous d\u00e9cor; an impressive contemporary art collection; crave-worthy Mediterranean fare at Ai Fiori from popular chef Michael White; and touches that Langham is known for, like the sweet ginger flower scent drifting through the building and the pink flowers adorning the lobby.\nThe Forbes Travel Guide Four-Star hotel eventually became the U.S. flagship for the brand, whose origins go back to 1865 with the opening of the opulent London outpost.\nAs The Langham, New York celebrates its fifth anniversary, we checked in with managing director Richard Bussiere, who shared how luxury has evolved over the years and where to find the best view in the Midtown hotel.\nHow has the hotel changed since opening five years ago?\nIn the five years since this hotel became The Langham, we have made some exciting cosmetic changes to the hotel in the form of new guest rooms, actually increasing our room count by 20 through some clever reconfigurations, and adding in two well-designed Penthouses and a Presidential Suite. We also completely revamped and expanded our event space, The Gallery at The Langham, to allow us to better host more signature events.\nAnd we installed a multimillion-dollar art collection by the famed New York painter Alex Katz \u2014 the largest private collection of his work outside of a museum that we know of in New York City.\nBut the most impactful change has been that, in transitioning an existing hotel to be a Langham, we have come to embody all of the best elements of the Langham brand, which has instilled a greater sense of pride in our employees, many of which have been here since the building first opened, and have made us better every day in the service we provide our guests.\nHow have the guests changed?\nWhen Langham took over this hotel, there was a lack of recognition among travelers in the U.S. about the Langham brand, and there was a perception that Midtown was not an ideal location for a luxury hotel.\nOver the last five years, awareness of the Langham brand name has grown, not only domestically but internationally, and Midtown has become a hot spot for hotel development, taking away the perception that this location isn\u2019t ready for a luxury hotel. Both of those factors have allowed our guest loyalty to grow stronger, so we have seen an increase in repeat guests as well as more guests coming from the cities in which our sister hotels are located.\nWhat does luxury hospitality mean to you?\nTwenty-five years ago, \u201cluxury\u201d had a very limited definition. It spoke to customers of a certain age, who drove a specific type of car, lived at a certain address, held a certain position in life. There were certain expectations of a luxury hotel that were understood and well-defined, by both the guests and the industry at large.\nLuxury consumers in 2018 are less defined. They can be from any walk of life, any age, any nationality. And, more often than not, they tell us what luxury is to them rather than us predicting what it will be on their behalf.\nFor those reasons, it is important to stay nimble, be innovative and to personalize the service you offer in the luxury market, because it changes based on the desires of each guest you serve.\nWhat do you think makes The Langham, New York, Fifth Avenue special?\nI truly believe our best asset is our colleagues. Being well-versed in the art of hospitality is not something that everyone can attain. We have managed to find and hold onto some of the very best in the industry that have this skill. They stay with us because we continually celebrate their success at the hotel level but also company-wide.\nSome of the stories I could tell you about how our colleagues have gone above and beyond for our guests would give you goosebumps. But even on the most basic level, there is not one member of our team who doesn\u2019t live our values here at The Langham.\nAnd we empower them to make our guests happy. No gesture is too big or too small if it will help that guest create a great memory of their time at our hotel.\nWhat are your favorite parts of the hotel?\nI love our event space, The Gallery at The Langham. It has wonderful natural light and it\u2019s where we house most of our art collection by Alex Katz. It has been the setting for some of our most memorable moments at the hotel as well, since it is where I have the most opportunities to interact with our guests at special events and celebrations.\nI also like the view from the southern side of the building \u2014 our Empire State Views. Not only do they afford a spectacular view of the Empire State Building but, on a clear day, you can see all the way down Fifth Avenue to One World Trade Center, which is an inspiring sight.\nWhat is next for the hotel?\nWe are currently investigating whether we have the space in the hotel to build a Club Lounge, which is something that Langham Hotels around the world are known for, and which would be a wonderful addition for our guests.\nWe are also continuing to strengthen our hotel as being one of the most sustainable in New York City. We currently hold Silver Status from EarthCheck, the independent benchmarking agency employed by Langham Hospitality Group, and we are going for Gold. We have committed to decreasing the overall output of waste from the hotel.\nFor example, we invested in a state-of-the-art Orca machine that turns food waste into environmentally safe water, and which allows us to break down 700 pounds of food per day. On average this investment has allowed us to keep 4,000 pounds of organic waste from going to landfill.\nLangham is opening a hotel in Dubai in 2020. What else is going on for the brand?\nLangham is expanding in very exciting ways over the next few years. In addition to Dubai, Langham has hotels planned for Tokyo, San Francisco and Jakarta, among other locations.\nI started in this industry out of college in 1980. In 1986, I moved to Asia as an expatriate, first in China and then in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. I came back to the U.S. in 2013 to work as the managing director of The Langham, Boston \u2014 my first time working in the U.S. in nearly 30 years.\nThis then lead to my current position, as managing director at Langham, overseeing both The Langham, Boston and The Langham, New York, Fifth Avenue, which is really the pinnacle of a career spent doing what I love. To have the opportunity to lead a luxury hotel in the middle of Fifth Avenue to greater and greater success is an achievement that makes me feel proud and excited to come to work every single day.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T16:29:07Z", "url": "https://stories.forbestravelguide.com/checking-into-the-langham-new-york-fifth-avenue", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "What does it take to be successful as a maker of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge-node product? This question doesn\u2019t have an obvious answer, partly because there are many contributors to success. But in a discussion with Open Silicon at the recent IoT DevCon, it became clear to me that taking their view into account makes for two opposing forces \u2013 forces they\u2019re trying to unify.\nOn the one side, there are numerous companies trying to jump into the IoT fray. The IoT involves many technologies, and many of these companies don\u2019t come to the party as experts in all of them. So platforms are a common way to get designers up and running as quickly as possible.\nSuch platforms pre-package many of the technology bits \u2013 that\u2019s the point. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to futz with those bits to get things working, and you can focus on domain-specific functionality and get to market quickly. The bad news is that, if everyone uses such platforms, then there is little room left for differentiation, since most of the underlying plumbing is the same.\nThat might not be an issue in the early days. If you\u2019re the first guy to do a rattlesnake early-alert app for hikers, then that\u2019s your differentiation; no one else does it. Simple. But once you have competition, if you\u2019re all using similar platforms, then your only real differentiation is your app. Anyone ever notice the user interfaces on phone apps? Yeah, they\u2019re dead dumb simple because fat thumbs can\u2019t poke small buttons and over-40 eyes can\u2019t read tiny print. (Hint: Google \u2013 or any \u2013 maps\u2026 little help?) So there\u2019s not much room to differentiate in the app itself.\nOpen Silicon says that, even if you can use lower-level software to differentiate, the economics don\u2019t work out. (I\u2019m taking that at face value; I haven\u2019t seen their math, nor have I gone through the process myself.) Their assertion is that you need to customize in hardware to differentiate in a way that will pay dividends.\nThey\u2019re trying to ease IoT SoC development by providing the building blocks for an IoT edge node, from the sensor interface (not the actual sensor) through to the wireless radio, and then work with their customers to establish customization, implemented in hardware, that differentiates the end product. The idea is that, based on the IP already available to Open Silicon (either their own or via IP subs), they can spin something up very quickly. While not typical, they had one tier-1 customer that finished a design from spec to tapeout in six months. And, because most of this can be done on older process nodes (in the 65 \u2013 180-nm range), mask costs aren\u2019t as astronomical as might be feared on an aggressive node.\nTheir focus tends to be more industrial, so their radio preferences are LoRa for longer range (based largely on a relationship they have with Semtech) and WirelessHART (industrial-strength features over the 802.15.4 radio standard that\u2019s familiar via Zigbee)*.\nDifferentiating via hardware can be a bold move, especially in a new market, where change is rapid and hardware change is not rapid. This probably isn\u2019t a strategy for a small company with moderate volumes, and I assume that they\u2019re not stating that only companies large enough to afford custom (or customized) SoCs will ever make money. In fact, a large company might have the capacity to do their designs in-house rather than using an outside partner like Open Silicon, so there\u2019s this middle profile of customer that could command large volumes but require outside services.\nIn addition, the IoT is very much of an agile play: get something out there, see what works, fix what doesn\u2019t. And do it with quick iterations. Accomplishing that with a hardware differentiation angle could be a tough play. But if you can manage it, there may be some money to be made if Open Silicon\u2019s assertion is correct.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T17:04:20Z", "url": "https://www.eejournal.com/2015/05/26/differentiating-your-iot-widget-in-hardware/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "In Scandinavia they don't call it Christmas (Christ-Mass), instead they still retain the old pagan name for the Yuletide celebrations which they call Jul (pronounced Yule).\nYule was a pagan festival that followed the midwinter solstice (usually around 21st December) and celebrated the return of the sun as the days slowly started to get longer again. The festivities, which involved lots of drinking and consuming of slaughtered animals, lasted up to 12 days, hence the 12 days of Christmas.\nIn Scandinavia it is still traditional to leave food out (usually porridge with butter) for the little red-capped tomte or nisse (household spirits or house elves) and thus we have the tradition of leaving food (usually cookies) out for Father Christmas, who in Sweden is called the Jul Tomte (the Yule Elf).\nAnother tradition in Scandinavia is that of the Christmas goat, whose origins are lost in the mists of time. The Jul Bok (Yule goat) is nowadays usually made from straw, which indicates that it was probably once an offering from the last harvest (like the British corn dollies), but other traditions have a man dressing up as goat at Yuletide, which could be distant memory of a pagan fertility ritual, or even be connected to the two goats who pulled Thor's chariot in Norse mythology.\nYule is the turning of the year when, as the days slowly start to get longer, the Nordic peoples celebrated the end of the year and the return of the sun, the completion of the another yearly cycle of life, death and rebirth.\nThe winter solstice was a particularly inauspicious the night when Odin was said to ride through the skies with the Wild Hunt collecting the souls of the dead. So everyone stayed indoors feasting, afraid to go outside lest they be caught out alone and abducted by the Wild Hunt.\nThe Modern English word Yule comes down to us via the Middle English yol from the Anglo-Saxon Geol, though nowadays it is more commonly known as Christmastide or the 12 Days of Christmas. However in Scandinavia they still call it jul (pronounced yule) or jol. One of the many names of Odin recorded in the Icelandic sources is Jolnir, which means The Yule One. Though this name probably refers to his role as leader of the Wild Hunt at Yule, rather than to a jolly giver of gifts! (I can find no evidence for the claim on Wikipedia that Odin was known as Jolfa\u00f0r, the Yule Father).\nSo how did Yule become Christmas? King Hakon of Norway, who was a Christian, passed a law that the Christian Christmas Day and the Pagan Yuletide celebrations were to be henceforth celebrated at the same time. While this only impacted the Norwegian territories it illustrates how these festivals were intentionally combined into one celebration.\nWe do know that the celebration of Yule wasn\u2019t always twelve days long. The Norse text 'Heimskringla: The Saga of Hakon the Good' talks about it lasting for three days, or as long as the ale continued. The night it began was known as slaughter night, where animals would be ritually slain and their blood collected in bowls to be splattered over the wooden idols of the gods and over the participants using a bunch of twigs. The animals' meat was then consumed in a feast which was known at the julblot.\nOther sources tell of the burning of a Yule log, the ashen remains of which were used to ward off evil spirits and other misfortunes, before being ignited again the following year to start the subsequent Yule fire. Also there was the eating of a Yule boar in honour of Freyr, a god associated with the harvest and fertility, who in Christian times became associated with St Stephen and his feast day of 26th December.\nMore variations can be found in 'Gulathingslog 7', where Yule was celebrated \u2018for a fertile and peaceful season,\u2019 we also see in the 'Saga of Hakon the Good' that Odin was hailed at this time as the bringer of victory, while Njord and Freyr were hailed for peace and fertility. Grimm\u2019s Teutonic Mythology speaks of how Frau Holle\u2019s annual wagon toured the countryside during the Yuletide season for blessings of a fruitful year ahead. Deities associated with winters, like the winter hunters Ullr and Skadhi, were also sometimes hailed. Since this is the day of darkest night, Nott (Goddess of Night), as well as silver-gleaming Mani (God of the Moon), may be honored. Some will also honor Dagr (God of Day) and Sunna (Goddess of the Sun) as she will only grow in prominence in the months ahead.\nOdin, in his aspect as the God of Death and Transition, is almost always honored at this time. The Wild Hunt rages over the whole world seeking out and sweeping up the dead, ushering out the dead old year itself. It's also common to honor Freyr and an envisioned new year of growth and promise. Also, Thor is honored for driving back the Frost Giants.\nIt was customary that no work was to be done during Yuletide. From Germanic sources we see stories of the Goddess Berchta visiting peoples houses and punishing those who had been spinning during Yule. In the Icelandic 'Svarfd\u00e6la Saga', we see a warrior who postpones a fight until after the Yuletide, and 'The Saga of Hakon the Good' also says that Yule was to be kept holy.\nModern Heathens opt to celebrate this time as the Twelve Days of Yule, with the last day culminating on 12th Night. Ancient calendars followed a different method of time, the solstice celebrations, as well as later Christmas observances, can vary from place to place as to when they occur. Today, most Pagans and Heathens celebrate the Yuletide as running from approximately December 20 \u2013 December 31.\nSome Heathen groups opt to conduct no business matters during the time of Yule. Some practitioners of the Northern Tradition will even choose to completely withdraw and go secluded from online mailing lists, bulletin boards, and social media outlets like Facebook so they can stay focused on spending the Yuletide with friends and family. While it\u2019s not always an option for everyone, there are those who choose to use vacation time from work so they can have the entire Yuletide off as well.\nYuletide was perhaps the greatest of all Heathen holidays. It was a time of celebration and close family contact that lasted twelve days and nights; each of which can be viewed as a month of the preceding year in miniature. Many of the customs associated with Christmas may have begun from Heathen Yule rites and customs. Many Gods and Goddesses are honored during Yuletide, and most followers of Asatru believe that the gods, as well as the spirits of the earth and the ancestors, join us for the celebrations at this time of year.\nMany traditions and practices are traditional to the month of Yule the most well known is, of course, the 12 Days of Yule. Some Heathens may bookend Yule with Mother\u2019s Night and Twelfth Night and not have specific observances in-between those days, and some other Heathens have taken things a step further. Pulling inspiration from the Nine Noble Virtues, and combining it with candle-lighting celebrations like Chanukah or Kwanzaa, they have come up with a reason to light a candle every night during the Yuletide.\nThe alter on Yule should face north, the area is decorated with holly and mistletoe and dried leaves and fruit such as hips and haw. A chalice of appropriate wine, mead or cider. The oak or pine log with up to 13 green, white and red candles decorated with carvings, runes or symbols is placed centrally on the altar. The appropriate fragranced incense burning and scenting the air, e.g., bay, juniper, cedar, pine or rosemary is pretty good for this.\nThere are several versions and variations to the 12 days of Yule. I like to call it the Twelve Nights of Yule since I usually hold the honor at night and it is the darkest time of the year. The version below is a combination with the most common points. Each night starts with the main focus followed by a reading and closed with a virtue meditation. Alternatively, a month is offered each night as a reflection.\nGlad Yuletide to Everyone.

So even trains were delayed or canceled as Amtrak did for trains passing through Chicago.\nIt has been so cold, the tracks freeze and the only way to switch tracks is to set them on fire.

{"text": "After much anticipation, Melania Trump has finally given the world a glimpse of her platform.\nLike those before her, Trump is keen to make a difference in her own unique way. Speaking in the Rose Garden, she officially launched \"Be Best,\" which tackles three key pillars: well-being, social media and opioid abuse.\nBut what does it take to be effective as first lady, especially amid an ever moving spectrum of expectations, responsibility and public opinion?\nThe first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, recently stated that most first ladies have focused on a single issue. In fact, several presidential spouses in the last century have taken on multiple causes, and Trump can look to them for guidance. To be successful, here are three recommendations from the Bush Institute's report \"A Role Without a Rulebook\" that Trump should consider implementing.\n1. Develop a strategic vision.\nAs first lady, Trump is uniquely positioned to be a compassionate listener and supportive facilitator. As she develops this platform, she should clearly define actionable goals that engage citizens at local and national levels.\nShe can look to her peer, Laura Bush, who launched \"Ready to Read, Ready to Learn\" with two clear objectives in mind: to ensure young children are prepared when they enter their first classroom, and once there have well-trained, qualified teachers. She also addressed how these goals would be achieved. By outlining a clear mission alongside defined actions, Bush was able to make progress on these goals during her time as first lady.\n2. Engage with citizens and peers.\nIn a polarized political climate, Trump must embrace the opportunity to transcend boundaries. Unelected but official, she is able to build bridges between government and civil society. For example, one of our most prominent first ladies, Eleanor Roosevelt, championed causes including racial equality, labor rights and women's rights, and she was the first presidential spouse to testify before a congressional committee. Central to her efforts: community and stakeholder outreach.\nEngagement with predecessors and peers can also aid Trump's efforts. For example, longstanding advocates for mental health and those battling addictive diseases, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford joined forces to advance policy and increase support for services. Reflecting on their collaboration, Carter said: \"(Betty and I) could be a stronger force if we worked as partners, and we did for many years.\"\nTrump has the opportunity to use the power of partnership. As political influences, first ladies can reach across industries and ideologies to unite diverse viewpoints and mobilize action. For example, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden launched \"Joining Forces,\" working with the public and private sectors to improve outcomes for service members, veterans and their families by providing the tools needed to succeed throughout their lives.\nWhile the role of first lady is one without a rulebook, these are proven actions that can aid Trump's efforts on a variety of platforms. When used effectively, a first lady's podium serves as a force for change.\nNatalie Gonnella-Platts is the deputy director of the Women's Initiative at the George W. Bush Institute and co-author of \"A Role Without a Rulebook: The Influence and Leadership of Global First Ladies.\" She wrote this for InsideSources.com.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T20:47:39Z", "url": "https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2018/05/16/3-things-melania-trump-must-make-best-initiative-successful", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Oh don\u2019t get me wrong, I love books with a passion but when it comes to Lent books I do like a picture to get my teeth in to. Last year I took a three month sabbatical from parish work to wander round art galleries near and far to choose forty paintings which spoke to me of Lent. Some of them are old friends, paintings I go back to time and time again, and some are new discoveries which took my breath away.

These forty paintings are perhaps not the greatest works of art on the themes I have chosen, but they were the ones which spoke to me last year. Next year I might chose something completely different. Please do comment on the art or the text and we can travel through this Lent together.

{"text": "How to reduce genres to only the 125 used by iTunes?\nSubject: How to reduce genres to only the 125 used by iTunes?\nI read in another post that iTunes uses a standard list of 125 genres.\nIs it possible to somehow limit the genres Jaikoz assigns to this list of 125 despite what MB or Discogs genres are?\nIt would be nice to have a checkbox that says \"Limit to iTunes genres\".\nI've just discovered the \"Filter/Non-standard-Genres/Non-standard Filters\" option so I guess I could use that to show me which ones are non standard then update them manually however it would be great to have a fuzzy matching option that matches non standard to iTunes standard genres.\nSubject: Re:How to reduce genres to only the 125 used by iTunes?\nYour best bet it to use the filter non-iTunes filters, non-standardFIlters limits to 255 genres but only half of these are in the predefined list provided by iTunes.\nHowever these options may be misleading you, although iTunes only recognises 125 genres by number you can still use any value to store a genre, it is just stored as text.\nThe Musicbrainz list is not limited in any sense so it would be rather difficult to map an arbitary Musicbrainz genre to an iTunes one.\nIs there anywhere in Jaikoz I can find the list of 255 genres that Jaikoz is using in this filter AND/OR the 125 iTunes genres so I can make sure that my collection only uses these \"standard\" ones?\nWould be good to have a cross matching facility, for example several of my songs have a genre \"Rock/Pop\" (a single genre) these could be matched to two seperate genres ie \"Rock\" and \"Pop\" then for anything not found in Jaikoz's cross matching genre database the User could enter a nominated genre ie \"Unknown\" so then you have a subset of your music (genre = \"Unknown\") you know needs to be listened to and a genre manually assigned.\nSo the the 125 genres listed are the one iTunes understands by genre number.\nPaul how about this ...if we got 50 people to each donate $10 OR reach $500 of donations (whichever comes first) would you add a genre cross matching function (as explained above) to Jaikoz? We could keep track by each person posting how much they have donated in this thread.\nI would rather see something like what mediamonkey has in some of their plugins. The ability to do white lists, black lists, and grey lists.\nThat way one would have far more control. For your example, you could use the white list and put in the allowed genres you have listed below. Or one could do a blacklist, which allows everything except for certain tags. This is useful for when you tag from other sources and don't want particular tags to show up. Say I tag from last.fm and don't want the tag \"seen live\" to be used. Lastly, the grey list would allow for tag replacement. So I could say anytime you run across the tag \"rock n roll\" replace it with \"rock and roll\" or \"rnb\" to \"r&b\", etc.\n2:The limited set of genres is incomplete and doesnt include newer genres , I dont see that this list should be seen as the definitive list.\nIn September I went to the yearly Musicbrainz Summit and genres were discussed there, see page 12 of https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ihe2nAatrLHfgPOvXWn_VJQVUVQ36iFy5MY03lTBhMM/edit?pli=1, hopefully a solution will emerge if you are interested in this it would be worth your while posting on the musicbrainz mailing list.\nJaikoz does already have a blacklist Preferences:Remote Correct:Correct Genres that supports wildcards, but not a whitelist or greylist, I can see these being useful additions.\nYes was already aware of this and although very helpful in stopping unwanted genres is not useful in correcting anything not on this list.\nI see limiting the list to the iTunes this to be a major advantage not a disadvantage even if its not a definitive list. Reason being is that people will always disagree on the exact genre of a song so its better to at least have a standard (the 125 iTunes genres) that people must stay within that way genres become a usable way (currently they are not due to so many genres) to sort, listen and create playlists since you know that when you select \"Rock & Roll\" genre you're getting all your Rock & Roll songs and don't also have to also look under \"Rock n Roll\", \"Rock and Roll\", \"Rock/Roll\" etc.\nAs its stands there are currently so many permutations of genres it makes them unusable so it would be good to have an option in Jaikoz to \"force\" the use of only \"standard\" genres regardless of what MB or Discogs has assigned to them. Of course this wouldn't prevent people NOT enabling this option and still going with MB, Discogs or their own preferred genres.\nI think greengeek's idea of a white lists is a good way of implementing this ie the white list would be initially populated with only the 125 iTunes genres (however Users could edit this list).\nIn preferences you could \"enable\" the whitelist which tells Jaikoz to enforce the use of these genres only. You would nominate a genre (eg \"Unknown\") that Jaikoz would assign to any songs for genres not found on this whitelist.\nAgain greengeek's idea of a grey list is a good way of enabling Jaikoz to use this list to fuzzy match non standard genres to the iTunes standard genres (or whatever the User decides they want to cross match to) eg \"Rock n Roll\", \"Rock and Roll\", \"Rock/Roll\" would all be in the grey list and be assigned to the iTunes standard \"Rock & Roll\" OR a genre of the User's choice if they don't want to use iTunes standard ones.\nYes I like this idea of a grey list, although there is a complication. If the user decides to use both Discogs genres and styles, do we need multiple greylists ?\nI can't think of a scenario where you'd need two greylists as this list is really what the User wants Jaikoz to use to cross match to their \"standard\" genres regardless of where the currently assigned genre came from ie was already assigned to song or came from MB or Discogs lookup.\nAs previously mentioned, by having a checkbox for \"Replace unmatched genres with:\" [User entered genre ie \"Unknown\"] the User would also have an option of either leaving unmatched genres as is OR replacing them with their chosen genre which enables them to seperate out these songs for manual review at a latter date.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T00:20:10Z", "url": "http://www.jthink.net/jaikozforum/posts/list/6838.page", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Having shared some beauty tips for teenage girls in my previous article, today we\u2019re discussing another common skin related issue constantly pestering all teenagers be it girls or boys which is Blackheads. Contrary to popular belief, blackheads are not caused by dirt but occur when your pores get clogged with excess sebum and dead skin cells. But there is absolutely no need to spend on expensive blackhead removal treatments when there is so much you can do from your very own kitchen. So Zuri\u2019s got you top 5 DIY remedies to get rid of those unsightly blackheads.\n1. Lemon juice: As we all know by now that blackheads are a result of open, clogged pores reacting with oxygen which turn them black. So it would be great if something could shrink those pores down. Lemon is a natural astringent that helps us do just that. So squeeze the juice of a lemon in a bowl, and apply it to the affected areas with a cotton ball to a washed, clean face. Leave it overnight and wash your face with lukewarm water the next morning. Dilute the lemon juice with water in case you have a sensitive skin.\n2. Baking soda scrub: Baking soda is also effective in treating blackheads. It helps get rid of all the dirt, grime from deep within the pores. So make a thick paste of baking soda and mineral water and massage the affected areas gently with this paste for a few minutes. Let it dry and then rinse it off with lukewarm water. Use this remedy twice a week for best results.\n3. Yogurt and oat face pack: Mix together 2 tbsp oats and 3 tbsp yogurt in a bowl. Now add a few drops of lemon juice and olive oil to it. Dab it onto the affected area and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Rinse it off with lukewarm water. Yogurt being rich in lactic acid and oats with its calming properties helps tackle blackheads effectively.\n4. Milk and honey pore strips: We are all aware of the blackhead removal strips available in stores. But alternatively you can also use milk and honey for this purpose. Honey is packed with anti-bacterial properties and milk is rich in lactic acid that helps keep skin clean and soft. And when mixed together, they also make for an excellent adhesive. Mix together 1 tbsp honey and 1 tsp milk and heat in the microwave for about 10 seconds. Now mix it together again and once it reaches a comfortable temperature, apply a thin layer on the blackheads. Next pat a strip of dry, clean cotton on it. Press gently and let it dry for a while. Now carefully peel the strip away and along with it also the blackheads. Later wash the area with cold water and use a moisturizer on top of it.\n5. Cinnamon and honey pore strips: Now this one makes for another very effective blackhead removal technique. Cinnamon improves blood circulation, giving your face a healthy glow and honey with its anti-bacterial properties helps get rid of blackheads. So mix together 1 part cinnamon powder and 1 part honey and apply this mixture onto your blackheads. Now press a clean cotton strip on top of it and let it sit for about 2 \u2013 3 minutes. Now gently peel it off. Wash the area and don\u2019t forget to follow up with a moisturizer.\nSo try one of these simple yet effective remedies and say goodbye to blackheads.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T03:44:43Z", "url": "https://zuri.in/2015/05/24/remove-blackheads/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "It's difficult, at best... an SL challenge! I study World Map 'really close'.. but that doesn't get it always. You can pretty much bet that if the road 'ends' on World Map.. it ENDS inworld. But then World Map doesn't show roads inside sims/regions that are on hub's property and off main route. One I found difficult was New Horizons... you need to FIND way to marina that UNDERNEATH airport. There isn't a road entrance to the airport.. at the airport level. I do inworld 'scouting'/finding with a Jeep.. it's very agile and fun to drive. At New Horizons I can 'fit' it through security gates and even thru doorways!! I've driven it off-road too.. works well for that.. outside of standard blockages... steep terrain, ban lines and orbs. I keep World Map UP on screen when driving (shrunk and off to side) as well as Mini Radar (set to show property lines). With no inworld GPS... it's rough!!\nOpen 24/7 with lighted helipad.. if you dare! Rural area on Route 10, Bertha Benz Memorial Drive. If pad precision is a little too tough... there's nearly 60K sqm abandon land adjoining in region. Even a bush plane can get down on 'em!

Add (and discuss) other favorites, I'm always searching for those Good Hauls.\nI've been attempting to travel Rt 8... to west (I believe)\u2026 just after the right turn off road that comes up from GTFO HQ. There seems to be an invisible prim that's blocking the road, I can't even WALK past the spot on right side road. On off left (and well onto shoulder) I can get around it. It's just before a Sim Crossing and Rez Zone, vehicles definitely will not 'power thru' it. I tried a couple things, though could not 'see it.. can only 'run into it'. I didn't know where else to put this, in forum.. so I stuck it here!\nJust wondered since I did notice others at a Hub as I unloaded. I didn\u2019t greet them and hate to say promptly drove off to another destination. yes, some may not care to be identified, but even leaving a \u2018name\u2019 off, all other data would be interesting to know.

{"text": "Many people are in need of loans for various reasons, some credible, others not so credible. Taking up a loan is a personal decision that can affect the borrower\u2019s financial well being. Either positively or negatively. If the money is being borrowed to be invested in appreciating assets or a business venture, this can help improve the borrower\u2019s future financial position. On the contrary, there are people who take up loans to fund their holidays, weddings or other leisure activities that will not earn them any tangible profits. Most of them end up regretting because their financials become a mess after that. Whatever the reason for taking up a loan, there are factors that you will need to consider prior to taking a loan.\nFirst is the economic position of the country which has a direct impact on the interest rate. There are times in an economy when it is not advisable to take up loans unless it is for an emergency. One example of such periods is when politics is heating up prior to elections. Since interest rates are determined by central banks in respective countries, they are more likely to increase the rates during such times. When political temperatures are high, an increase is an attempt to raise more funds. Why? This is to shield the economy from political uncertainties.\nSecond is the type of financial institutions one intends to borrow from. Much as these institutions are govern by a regulatory body, they each have different lending requirements. Savings and credit cooperatives for example will require you to save a certain amount of money with them before they can give you credit. Other financial institutions only give secured loans which must be accompanied by collateral. Licensed moneylenders for example ask for collateral in form of goods worth the loan amount. Many people go to them because of the fast approval time and less stringent checks.\nThe other important thing to think about is the repayment period for the loan. Most lending institutions give options so that the borrower can select what fits them. They however try and convince their clients to spread the loan for the longest period, citing lower monthly repayments. While this may sound lucrative, you will end up paying more than someone who took the same amount and paid higher installments for a shorter period of time.\nLast but not least is reading, understanding and comparing terms and conditions of different lending institutions. In most cases they appear the same but there is always that small difference that can easily be ignored. And it makes a whole lot of difference. In fact, very few people take their time to go through the whole blue print and seek explanations on areas where they do not understand. These few individuals that do, can attest that this effort in some cases has saved them loads of money.\nIf you need a loan, approach a bank or a licensed moneylender. We are the best licensed moneylender you can find in the whole of Singapore. Our fast approval, instant cash and low interest rates are why our customers always come back to us.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T20:33:23Z", "url": "https://www.legalloansingapore.com/moneylender-singapore/consider-taking-loan/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "A group of IG Group clients who incurred millions in losses after betting against the Swiss franc are escalating their dispute with the company, alleging that the events of 15 January has revealed serious \u201csystemic failings\u201d on the part of IG.\nThe members of the group lost substantial cash deposits and are facing claims from IG for the payment of significant negative balances, according to a lawyer representing the clients. The group is arguing that IG\u2019s claims are unfounded and unfair and that the spread betting firm is guilty of systemic failures in its treatment of customers.\nIn particular, it contends that IG is in breach of its contractual obligations including the obligation to provide best execution and in its regulatory requirements under various Principles for Business and the specific rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Conducts of Business Sourcebook.\nHundreds of IG customers racked up losses of \u00a318.4 million after the Swiss National Bank unexpectedly removed its three-year EURCHF floor on 15 January, which caused severe distress in the market and resulted in some retail brokers going under. The Swiss franc surged by as much as 40% versus the euro within minutes of the central bank announcement.\nIG, which also suffered losses, has recouped some of the minimal sums outstanding from customers, but is in dispute with a group who account for a considerable share of the outstanding debts.\nNatalia Chumak, a partner at specialist litigation City firm Signature Litigation, who is representing the group in their complaint against IG to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), says that in justifying the claims against the group, IG heavily relies on its terms and conditions (T&Cs).\n\u201cHowever, analysis of IG\u2019s T&Cs, as well as the company\u2019s website and their behaviour on 15 January 2015, shows these claims to be groundless and unfair,\u201d she claims.\nSpeaking to Profit & Loss, Chumak argues IG must have been aware that the events that followed the SNB\u2019s decision to remove the floor was an \u201ceventual possibility\u201d.\nShe points to IG\u2019s decision in 2011, immediately after the floor was introduced by the central bank, to remove its offering of guaranteed stop orders in relation to EURCHF trades, indicating that IG knew that the events that occurred on 15 January could be a possibility.\n\u201cHowever, IG, appears to have done nothing in advance to prevent or mitigate the risks for their clients, and worse still, continued to offer aggressively leveraged trades inducing more clients to open accounts, and further, increasing the clients\u2019 exposure which IG could not manage,\u201d she says.\nChumak adds that the T&Cs effectively allow IG to work customers\u2019 positions however the company chooses, and claims that IG appears to have offloaded its own risks during the Swiss franc surge before starting to fill its customers\u2019 orders.\nShe says IG does not inform customers how it handles their trades, and still has not disclosed its full execution policy \u2013 something that the group contends is in violation of FCA rules.\n\u201cIt turns out that there is no limit to how much a customer can lose by trading with IG, but IG does not tell this to its customers clearly. IG can choose whether or not to take any risks, but will always take advantage of any upside,\u201d Chumak says.\nShe adds, \u201cMy clients\u2019 complaint is that IG has induced customers to open accounts with the company with misleading statements on their website and offers of low margins. IG withdrew or minimised its own risks long in advance of 15 January, without being transparent with its customers about the risks.\nThe group is presently pursuing a complaint with the FOS. Some customers have petitioned the FCA to investigate current practices in the sector. Chumak says the group of customers she is representing wants money that has been wiped off their accounts to be reinstated. They also want IG to drop its claim for the payment of significant negative balances.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T18:42:06Z", "url": "https://www.signaturelitigation.com/natalia-chumak-featured-in-profit-loss-magazine-re-ig-group-and-swiss-franc/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Saturday morning, we hoped in a rented white Beetle for Hallstatt from Munich. Still half asleep, two and a half hours later, we arrived in the quiet small Austrian town. Lots of tourists were strolling along the steep paths. Most of the shops were closed, only few caf\u00e9s and restaurants were welcoming passerby.\nAlong the Hallst\u00e4tter lake, the lovely traditional houses are agglomerated in random patterns on an abrupt slope. Like in most European villages, a church overlooks the town. The lovely sunny weather lead us on a stroll between the tight alleys and steep stairs.\nOf course, the main attraction of the Hallstatt is its gorgeous lake and surrounding mountains. The winter scenery was very impressive to see. Every point of view was breathtaking. I can\u2019t imagine how fall and summer must be in this charming Austrian town.\nEvery time I have the opportunity to visit Paris, I feel like it is like a living dream. Its magic emanates from the historic buildings, cobble streets, chic restaurants and sumptuous monuments. A real treat for any history, art or architecture lovers. Ooohh and the food. I don\u2019t need to say more.\nThe first day I went to Centre Pompidou for the Tadao Ando exhibition and the general collections of modern art. The center is already a great piece of work showing its technical systems and structure as part of its architecture design. Inside, the forum connects the accesses to galleries together. The showcased artworks include works from Picasso, Braque, C\u00e9zanne, Matisse, and so on.\nA spontaneous night stroll lead us to the beautifully decorated H\u00f4tel de ville and Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame. Although the nights were cold and windy, a lot of people were taking advantage of the Christmas lights and ambiance.\nThe holidays season is probably the peak time for the metropolis. Walking in the streets is a real delight to the eyes with all the festive lights hanging above your heads. The Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es was blushing in red from the start to the end.\nThe next morning, we walked to my favorite spot which is la Seine, the famous river flowing through the city. The thing I noticed and love about these pictures of the river is the perfect harmony between all the elements, the historical buildings, the rocks, the old bridges. They seem to tell the same kind of story of a place we read so much about in books and movies.\nOn Sunday evening, we drove to Versailles with our bags filled with sandwiches and snacks. Unfortunately, the waiting line was unbelievably long so we decided to stroll around the gardens instead.\nNear the West coast of France, Nantes is a charming city that preserved its historic culture through its architecture and its local gastronomy. With the holidays, the downtown area is lit up with Christmas markets and lights above almost every street. From Munich, my 2-hours flight brought me directly to the modest airport of Nantes at night. The first days were meant to just stay home and recharge.\nThe city lays in the region of Loire-Atlantique which harbours a lot of castles from as far as the Renaissance period. The area is also famous for its cr\u00eapes bretonnes, seafood, pastries like le nantais, and so on. Obviously, I took the opportunity to gain some weight and empty the wallet.\nSpending Christmas here was quite lovely for the change of scenery and for the French cuisine. And seeing my relatives again felt good to my soul (even through the usual family drama during the holidays ;) ).", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T16:26:26Z", "url": "https://elsale.co/blog/category/travel", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "There are two families of ticks that makeup the majority of the ticks in the Northeast. Hard and soft ticks. The major differences are the reproduction cycle. Hard tick females have one blood meal and can produce 10,000 eggs then die. Soft tick females will feed and then lay 20-50 ticks, feed again lay another batch and repeat. In the Northeast the most common hard ticks are the Brown Dog Tick, American Dog Tick and the Deer Tick.\nTicks are very good at hitchhiking. They can sense your vibration, shadow and CO2 as you approach. Ticks wait in areas ideal for a blood meal in a specific position called questing. They have hooks on their legs that are held up and out to hitch onto a passing meal.\nThe three main ticks in the Northeast all have 8 legs as adults, require 2 years to mature from egg to adult and differ in size for the most part. You can easily identify a tick embedded in your skin as it becomes engorged with blood. They all have 4 life stages egg, larva, nymph and adult. Once the egg hatches the larva needs to seek a blood meal, most often mice or other small animals. The ticks in the Northeast will molt after the first blood meal and winter as nymph under leaves or other natural debris protected from winters cold weather. In the spring the nymphs emerge and look for another blood meal. With the meal complete they will molt into adults and look for another blood meal and start the reproduction process.\nTicks can transmit various tick borne human diseases including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease. Another less common threat is tick paralysis. A condition that develops during feeding and can result in death but the symptoms disappear rapidly when the tick is removed. When you work outside in a brush or leaf area you run the risk of a tick hitchhiking on your clothes. This is why you should always, if possible wear long sleeves and pants preferable light in color. Tape the pant cuffs tight to your legs to stop ticks from climbing up onto your skin. When you complete the outdoor activities you should remove all clothing and shower. When drying off perform a tick check on all parts of your body. At this stage you are looking for just the tick. In 24 hours stay alert for engorged females.\nThe first step in control is inspection and education. Our pest management professional will inspect your yard and identify the problem areas, areas that should have brush or shrubbery cut back and other non-pesticide items that naturally keep ticks away from your home. Then we treat the \u201chot\u201d areas which are most likely to have a population of ticks. Treatments and inspections are repeated 2 additional applications for traditional treatments and every 3 weeks for organic treatments.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T07:03:27Z", "url": "http://www.callfreedompest.com/ticks/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Last September of 2009, I got the itch to take a course or two at a local University. I checked on-line and found that Brown University had some very interesting courses in the evenings. I was so afraid that I would fail or need to drop out because of my mental illness that I almost did not scratch that itch that I had to go back.\nLast fall I chose two courses in my field of interest. Both were in the Neuroscience Department. The first course was entitled \"Learning and Memory.\" The course covered the neurological pathways that we use from infancy through adulthood in order to remember what we have learned and how to access it. The best part for me was doing a dissection of the human brain!\nThe second course that I took was entitled \"Mental Illness and the Brain.\" The course covered all the mental illnesses that people live with, where in the brain the site of the disease is located, what medications are used and the method of operation of these medications. This was by far one of the most fascinating courses I have ever taken. Since I am bipolar, that part of the course was very informative, but so were all the other aspects of studying the etiology of other mental illnesses and the hope for new medications.\nHaving been successful in the fall of last year, I decided to take two more courses this spring. The first course I chose is entitled \"Infant and Child Mental Health.\" This is a course that is totally foreign to me, but a subject I have always wanted to learn. So far things are going well.\nThe second course I chose was another interest of mine, and was entitled \"Social Media and Online Technologies.\" When I realized that Brown was on Twitter, I was amazed and intrigued especially since we had just set up a Facebook page for Hillsgrove House and we hope to be on the World Wide Web soon. I am learning how integral these types of communication have become to socialization amongst people, and particularly how it is benefiting the mentally ill. People can now communicate any time of the day, especially if they just need a friend to converse with late at night. I look forward to exploring the theories of this course as it progresses.\nI cannot express how much taking these courses has done for my self-esteem. I feel like I come alive when I'm in class. What a sense of accomplishment I feel when I can think through my medications and my mental illness. The most important thing is that if I had to drop out, or if I failed a course, that I am not a failure.

SESE is a lot like Seed Savers Exchange, except, well\u2026they\u2019re Southern! They are based in Virginia, and a lot of their seed growers also reside in the south. The reason this is important, is their seeds are grown and saved in hot, humid regions, so they are likely well-adapted to dealing with our hot climate. It might be interesting to try the same varieties from both Seed Savers and Southern Exposure just to see if there are any differences in how they perform for us here in Kansas.\nSESE has a number of \u201cnew\u201d items this year, but I\u2019m mostly going to highlight some varieties that they have, but might be hard to find elsewhere.\nPurple Podded Yard Long Bean \u2013 This pole bean is a type of asparagus bean, or Chinese yard long bean. This particular bean is a very vigorous grower and has gorgeous dark purple beans that retain the purple color when stir-fried. You need a big trellis!\nPole Lima Beans \u2013 SESE has a nice selection of Pole Lima Beans that are hard to find otherwise. Black Knight Butterbean is a new variety that sounds intriguing. Violet\u2019s Multi-Colored Butterbean is hilarious to grow, because every pod yields different colored beans. I\u2019ve always thought it would be fun to try to isolate and breed individual varieties out of this variety.\nTashkent French Marigold \u2013 Okay, this seems like a really interesting French Marigold variety, but I have to be honest that it is mostly intriguing to me because it was found in Uzbekistan, and I find Uzbekistan an intriguing country. It is also supposedly sweet smelling, rather than astringent like most marigolds.\nAsian Tempest Garlic \u2013 What\u2019s not to love with a name like Asian Tempest? This is a very hot garlic raw, but mellow after roasting. Of course, we are past the planting window for garlic now, but keep it in mind for next year!\nGrey Griselle Shallot \u2013 SESE is one of the only sources I\u2019ve found in the U.S. for French Grey Shallots. Prized for French cooking, some consider these shallots the only \u201ctrue\u201d shallot. As with the garlic, we are past the planting time for this year.\nHave a great weekend! Get all that Christmas shopping done!\nI finally received my 2010 Johnny\u2019s catalog this week. Not that I\u2019m impatient or anything, but they have had their new 2010 items up on their brand new, sparkly website for a couple weeks now. I had to work really hard to wait to do this review until I actually had a catalog. So, without further ado, here are 5 interesting items from their catalog this year.\n\u2018Albion\u2019 Strawberry \u2013 This is a day-neutral (potential to fruit from spring to frost, but often doesn\u2019t in the middle of the hot summer here), that has a great flavor. I tried these out in Oregon and found them quite delicious. They also have good disease resistance, not to mention that perfect strawberry shape.\n\u2018Tempo\u2019 Artichoke \u2013 A purple globe artichoke that produces in only 100 days, so it can be grown as an annual. I\u2019m curious to see how well it tolerates our heat.\n\u2018Purple Pak\u2019 & \u2018Deep Purple\u2019 Carrots \u2013 This whole purple carrot business is making me a little dizzy. Last year they had \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 which is nowhere to be seen this year, and \u2018Deep Purple\u2019 was on the website, but had a seed failure. Now there is \u2018Purple Pak\u2019 and \u2018Deep Purple\u2019 is apparently in stock. Still, I have a fondness for purple carrots, so I doubt I\u2019ll be able to resist.\nIce Plant \u2013 Buried in the Micro Mix Varieties is this gem. Ice plants are frequently grown as ornamentals, but their succulent leaves are also edible. They have juicy leaves that are flavored with a hint of saltiness and lemon.\n\u2018Red Cardinal\u2019 Spinach \u2013 This is a replacement for the \u2018Bordeaux\u2019 Spinach that we had out in the garden this year. It has more oval leaves than \u2018Bordeaux\u2019 and a more upright habit. It also has red stems and veins.\n\u2018Sprite\u2019 Honeydew \u2013 This isn\u2019t exactly new, but it is new to Johnny\u2019s. You might have seen the \u201cSprite\u201d honeydew melons in grocery stores, but now you can grow them at home! These are little, 1 lb. melons with white flesh.\nThe wintery weather followed by cold temperatures today has frozen the garden pretty solid.\nThe spinach leaves are like ice cubes. They will probably thaw out in a couple days when it is warmer and do just fine. In fact, this picture was from yesterday morning, and even this afternoon, they are thawing out.\nLikewise the Swiss Chard\u2026while the bigger leaves are probably toast, the young central leaves will probably keep growing if it warms up again.\nThe Brussels Sprouts have reached the end of their lives\u2026not because they can\u2019t take the cold, but because I sawed them off this afternoon.\nI sawed them off with a pruning saw. Rather interesting \u2013 the center of the stems was hollow. I don\u2019t know if this was just the result of normal growth or if some insect had bored in. The plants are frozen solid, but they should thaw out just fine in the corner of my office. I\u2019ll snap the sprouts off in a day or two.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T04:37:00Z", "url": "https://thedemogarden.org/2009/12/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Only within the last 16 months, the world has seen the emergence of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the Paris agreement which has just recently come into force, and the so called New Urban Agenda (NUA). All three of them represent bold and (more or less) legally binding agreements by the Member States of the United Nations. The New Urban Agenda should be the most concrete and practical one since it addresses the smaller scale of government, i.e. cities \u2013 the place where we will win or lose our struggle for a more just, equitable and indeed sustainable world.\nNovember 8, 2016 Comments Off on The New Urban Agenda: More Power to Cities? Yes, but how?\nOn September 22 2013, 50.9% of the Hamburg citizens voted in a referendum for the full remunicipalisation of the energy distribution grids in the city. The referendum was initiated by the citizen\u2019s initiative \u2018Our Hamburg \u2013 Our Grid\u2019 (OHOG) and constituted the climax of an intense political controversy that lasted for more than three years. Through this vote Hamburg has received international attention and became a flagship example for remarkable civil engagement. In the international best-seller \u201cThis Changes Everything\u201d (2014), Naomi Klein sees the driving motive in the people\u2019s \u2018desire for local power\u2019. Indeed it is true that under the constitution of the City of Hamburg, a successful referendum has a binding effect, which left the City government no other option than to announce the implementation of the referendum decision and to start the remunicipalisation process immediately after the vote. Now, three years after the referendum, it is time to evaluate what has been achieved so far. A series of interviews with key actors that were and, for the most part, still are involved in the remunicipalisation process shed some light on the remunicipalisation process and recent developments.\nIt is almost time. One of the most important international summits is on our doorstep. Next week the UN General Assembly will be gathering in Quito, Ecuador to (hopefully) agree and sign the so called New Urban Agenda, the international urban \u201cconstitution\u201d supposed to be guiding sustainable urban development in the next 20 years. Almost 40,000 participants from all around the world have registered. After the successful adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the Paris agreement, expectations on the next UN cities summit are high. The question however is: will it deliver? Will delegates agree on a meaningful outcome that ultimately provides guidance for national and local governments? Will it keep up to the promise to be the \u201cSDG implementation summit\u201d? In fact, the goals and principles of the SDGs and the Paris agreement will be confronted with a reality check \u2013 since first and foremost much of their substance will have to be implemented by the cities of this world.\nOctober 13, 2016 Comments Off on Habitat III.

{"text": "ABOVE: A vintage cabriolet on a corniche road in Luxembourg. INSET BELOW: Minicars in Montmarte, Parisian parking.\nCar travel in Europe can be a joy or a nightmare, depending on where and when you drive. During August, when countless millions of Europeans pack up their family cars and drive to the beaches or mountains, traffic jams can rob even the most scenic European touring routes of their charm. And at any time of year, driving in a major city like London, Paris, or Rome can be nerve-wracking (or at least unpleasant) to the foreign tourist.\nSpring and fall are the best times for a motoring vacation in Northern and Central Europe. In Southern Europe, winter can also be pleasant if you avoid the Christmas break. If your vacation is tied to the school calendar, try visiting in June, before the summer season reaches its peak.\nMany tourists, especially those from North America, make the mistake of planning car itineraries built around Europe's largest cities. They end up having to cope with nerve-wracking traffic, scarce parking, and unfamiliar regulations--all while trying to catch a glimpse of the sights through a mass of cars, motorscooters, bikes, and tour buses.\nTake the train between major cities. Rent cars for local or regional excursions, or for legs of your trip (e.g., Paris to the Riviera) where you want to stop and enjoy sights along the way.\nVisit a country like Denmark, Norway, or Sweden where even the largest cities are relatively car-friendly and you can leave town for driving excursions with a minimum of hassle.\nABOVE: The Peugeot Traveller van on a European highway. Residents of countries outside the U.S. can save money with short-term tourist leases from Peugeot.\nComparison shop. Check prices at European brokers that specialize in leisure rentals and short-term leasing programs. Check each company's age restrictions if you're under 25 or over 65, and see \"Lease for longer trips\" below.\nPlan carefully. Rent a car for only as long as you'll need it, to avoid early-return penalties. If you're on a budget, avoid drop-off charges by planning a circular itinerary.\nBook ahead. If you live outside Europe, you're likely to get a better deal by making arrangements from abroad.\nLease for longer trips. A short-term car lease can save money on rentals of 21 days or more. Such \"buy back\" or \"purchase-repurchase\" leases are especially useful for students and senior citizens, since age restrictions are minimal.\nBuy a pass. A Rail 'n Drive Pass combines the speed and comfort of train travel with the convenience of a vehicle for local excursions.\nThink small. Fuel is expensive in Europe, streets are narrow in many cities, and small cars are easier to park than large ones. Unless you need a large car or van, stick with a small to midsize car.\nImportant note: If you're picking up a car outside the European Union, you may encounter bureaucratic hassles if you later decide to drop the car off in an EU country. To avoid potential problems, ask for a car that's regisftered in the EU if you plan to drive there.\nPrepare at home. European regulations, driving customs, and road signs can be confusing to foreigners, so use the information resources below to learn the basics ahead of time.\nBe alert. If you're from North America, forget about turning on the cruise control and floating along in the left lane while listening to Santana and slurping coffee from your MegaMug. You could have a panic attack when a BMW comes tearing up behind you, left flasher blinking, at 250 km/h (156 mph) or faster. And if you've never had to enter or exit a traffic circle (a.k.a. rotary or roundabout) in heavy traffic, get ready for a new experience--especially if local laws give priority to traffic coming from the right.\nCarry an International Driving Permit. This passport-like document (sometimes called an International Driver's License) is a translation of your home license. It's required in some countries and optional in others, but it's well worth having to avoid problems if you're stopped by the police or want to rent a car in a foreign country.

{"text": "Just like your furnace and AC unit, your roof can also benefit from routine inspections to ensure that it\u2019s operating at its best. With winter weather quickly approaching, you want to ensure that your shingles and gutters are ready for whatever Mother Nature will throw our way in the next few months. It can be easy to forget about scheduling an annual roof inspection, especially when you have not yet noticed an interior leak or can\u2019t easily spot exterior damage. When was the last time you took a peek in your attic to check for moisture? Don\u2019t wait until you spot damage to schedule your inspection. Here are a few reasons why it\u2019s important to not only have your rooftop and gutter system inspected on a routine basis, but to also hire a professional to inspect your home.\nThroughout the year in the Midwest, our rooftops see a range of weather conditions. Between the heavy rains, high winds, hail, ice and snow, your rooftop needs to be in tip top shape in order to properly protect the structural integrity of your home. High winds and hail can cause shingles to become loose, curled or removed completely leaving your roof vulnerable to moisture. Ice dams and snow can cause a lot of extra weight to hang from your shingles and gutters if moisture cannot find a proper way to drain away from the roof. By ensuring that your shingles and gutters are in good shape every year, especially after a strong summer storm has passed through your neighborhood, you can avoid any major repairs down the road. Even if you notice that you are only missing one shingle here and there, those types of issues can quickly become a larger problem that comes with an expensive price tag.\nEven though getting up on your roof may seem like an easy task, it\u2019s best to leave this household chore to a professional. Not only is it unsafe to walk on your roof, but it becomes especially dangerous if you do not have the proper equipment or know how to safely maneuver once you are up there. Our team at Exterior Remodel and Design is here to help inspect your rooftop in a timely and safe manner. Our team knows exactly what to look for inside and outside of your home when determining if your roof is in need of a little TLC. As roofing experts, we are trained to spot even the smallest discrepancy that could easily go unnoticed and cause interior damage down the road. We will not only inspect your rooftop, but we will also provide an accurate assessment of our observations.\nEven though scheduling a roof inspection when you do not notice any damage may seem like a waste of time and money, but the price is drastically cheaper than replacing an entire roof once a problem has been left unaddressed for a period of time. An annual roof inspection is an investment for your home and can extend the overall lifespan of your shingles and gutters.\nIf you would like to schedule a roof inspection, give our team a call today at (402) 861-0000. You can trust Exterior Remodel & Design for the highest quality installation, repair and inspection.

{"text": "On May 19th, 2017, the 7th International Art Festival of Soong Ching Ling School was held at the Shanghai Grand Theatre. More than 670 students from 20 countries and areas joined this multicultural performance.\nDuring the Art Festival, the students performed in a variety of traditions. Folk music, Kun Opera, Suzhou Ping Tan, Yueju Opera and Chinese folk dance showed traditional Chinese culture while Hawaii Haka and street dance displayed rich world culture. By being rooted in Chinese traditional culture, students are more able to function authentically as global citizens.\nIn addition to the inheritance of Chinese culture, one innovation in the Art Festival this year is that the students presented a stage play \u201cAn Unforgettable Birthday Party\u201d. Grade 1 to 5 students from 15 classes performed in this 52-minute play. They learned about love, giving and receiving through their performance.\nConfucius said that to love others, one should start by loving his or her family.

{"text": "Gail Reid: When Rhoda Janzen is injured in a car accident shortly after her husband of 15 years dumps her for a man, she postpones her sabbatical and returns to the comfort of her parents' California home. Her parents are leaders of the Mennonite church so the worldly Rhoda's return to her Mennonite roots is a distinctly different kind of memoir.\nThis story evokes themes from Elizabeth Gilbert's \"Eat, Pray, Love\" as well as a humorous response to everything reminiscent of David Sedaris and Nora Ephron. What's uniquely different is the Mennonite angle. Few of us have insight into the beliefs and everyday life of this fascinating religious group.\nI don't like to bash a book that many people will, in fact, enjoy. After all, it has been on the bestseller's list for several months. However, the humor is much too caustic for me and sometimes crosses the line to mean spirited. The author is very impressed with her academic credentials and she does have an admirable vocabulary; but, I picked it up the first time that she was a smart cookie.

{"text": "TWO games into the new year and WGC are in something of a crisis.\nTheir second defeat of 2017, this time at league leaders London Colney, has seen Adam Fisher's side concede 11 goals in two losses that effectively end any promotion aspirations from the Spartan South Midlands League Premier this season. They were beaten 5-2 at lowly St Margaretsbury the previous Monday.\nThey now trail long-time leaders and Saturday's victors by 19 points, even though they have three games in hand. WGC are also out of all the cup competitions they entered this season.\nCertainly, manager Fisher is going to have to make a major overhaul of his defence.\nHe welcomed back Martin Standen into central defence for this one, switched newcomer Louis Lee to right-back and preferred Sean Brettell to Jay Welsh in the other full-back position. Lee Robins was restored upfront.\nDespite the ultimately comprehensive London Colney victory, this was a very strange game, that split conveniently into three very differing thirds.\nIn the opening 30 minutes, hosts Colney dominated and overran WGC with a devastating three goal in 16 minute spell.\nThere was just five minutes gone when the leaders struck first.\nEx-WGC man Dave Parkinson, who was a thorn in his former team's side for the 75 minutes he was on the pitch, outpaced Brettell down the right. His over-hit cross to the far post was retrieved by home top scorer Jon Clements, who turned inside Lee and shot home under keeper Jack Metcalfe on his near post.\nOn 14 minutes the lead was doubled, a long ball found home skipper Greg Shaw, he chipped into the middle and Clements netted his second with a stooping header past Metcalfe.\nTwo minutes later, Parkinson scored a fine solo third. Again he outpaced Brettell, slipped inside Yasin Boodhoo's challenge and ended with a finely placed shot beyond Metcalfe into the far corner.\nAt his point it looked as though WGC might be half-a-dozen in arrears by the interval, as they could barely get across the half-way line.\nIt took 25 minutes for them to fashion their first opening, a shooting chance for Josh Bronti, well blocked by Colney defender Gregg Douglas.\nAnd Bronti played a part in the Citizens pulling a fine goal back to reduce arrears on 29 minutes, getting away down the right to pull over a cross that central defender Boodhoo spectacularly volleyed in for his third goal in successive games, amid the defensive mayhem.\nThat sparked an immediate change in WGC's demeanour. Two minutes later, Standen was inches wide with a powerful header past an upright, rising to a Brettell free-kick.\nAnd on 35 minutes, a second WGC goal, again created by a Bronti cross that produced a flashing header from Robins beyond home keeper Gowans, had the Citizens' majority in the 101 crowd on their feet.\nWGC finished the half in total contrast to their performance in the opening 30 minutes, when on the stroke of the interval, a Boodhoo header clipped the post on its way out.\nThe Herns Lane side couldn't wait to get going in the second 45 minutes with the score now 3-2 and in the opening minutes, Manny Melford-Rowe brought a diving save from Gowans.\nBut seven minutes in, it looked as if the WGC revival might be at an end, when Metcalfe took down Colney winger Jack Woods after Clements had made a run across the face of the visitors' defence, unchecked.\nThe under-pressure keeper redeemed himself, pushing away Shaw's spot-kick in fine style, to keep his side in the game.\nIf the match had a turning point, it came just past the hour. On 62 minutes, Bronti was sent scurrying down the middle. He got in a fierce shot, Gowans parried but couldn't hold and Ashley Kersey rammed in the rebound.\nBut WGC players and supporters's joy was short-lived, referee Lungarella consulted an assistant with flag raised and the goal was chalked off for offside.\nThe Citizens looked immediately deflated. Manager Fisher replaced Melford-Rowe, who had a fitness test before the game with new signing Marcus Campbell and Robins with Taishan Griffith.\nBut the final third of the game proved as disastrous for the visitors as the opening half-hour had been.\nJust before being substituted, Parkinson made a strong run down the right and when he crossed low, Clements swept home his hat-trick goal to effectively decide the points.\nThree minutes later as WGC pushed up, Standen found himself stranded on half-way. He couldn't cut out a through ball and Colney's Spencer Mardel raced completely clear to poke the fifth past Metcalfe, with WGC defenders vainly appealing for offside.\nTwo minutes later, home substitute Jay Caines really rubbed it in with a lofted effort from way outside the area that cleared the beleagured Metcalfe to find the far corner and give the hosts a somewhat flattering six goal haul, considering the middle half-hour of the game.\nWGC: Metcalfe, Lee, Boodhoo, Standen, Brettell, Payne, Long (Read 82), Robins (Griffith 67), Bronti, Kersey, Melford-Rowe (Campbell 60).", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T12:23:47Z", "url": "http://welwyngardencityfc.org.uk/wgc-v-london-colney/4593470346", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Home/Residential, Technology/August 1 is World Wide Web Day!\nWeb browsing and many other online activities we take for granted today wouldn't have been possible without the invention of the World Wide Web.\nIt\u2019s difficult to get one\u2019s arms around just how impactful the arrival of \u201cthe internet\u201d was for people all around the world. And it\u2019s amazing to think how relatively young this technology is, considering its extraordinary role in changing how the world communicates.\nWe put \u201cinternet\u201d in quotes because what many people think of as the internet actually refers to a few different things. Often, people confuse \u201cWi-Fi\u201d with the internet, although Wi-Fi refers only to an internet connection being broadcast over radio waves.\nAnother term that gets mixed up with internet is \u201cWorld Wide Web,\u201d but really the World Wide Web (aka \u201cThe Web\u201d) is a global information system that operates over the internet \u2013 much as email or Skype or Netflix do. What makes the Web so interesting and important is that it essentially made the internet a more user-friendly place where people could easily share ideas, photos, baby videos \u2013 you name it.\nSince August 1 is World Wide Web Day, we thought we\u2019d take note of some of the facts and history behind the Web.\nThe invention of the World Wide Web is credited to an English software engineer named Tim Berners-Lee. The son of parents who were among the very first computer scientists, Berners-Lee was working at CERN \u2014 a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland in the 1980s \u2014when he became frustrated by the fact that information on computers was hard to share. Plus, the information was often in different computer languages. There had to be a better way.\nIf all of that sound mostly like gobbledygook to you, that\u2019s OK. The point is, it worked, and worked so well that by the time the mid 1990s rolled around, businesses started to get the point that they needed to be on the World Wide Web just to compete. Everyone else soon followed.\nAdaptation to the Web was aided by the fact that CERN agreed to make the underlying code for the Web available without any royalty fees \u2014 essentially opening up the Web to anyone and everyone and fueling the rapid growth of the internet, the World Wide Web and just about anything else you can think of that requires an online connection.\nDespite the seeming ubiquity of internet access, there are still billions of people around the world who don\u2019t have a connection \u2014 reliable or otherwise. That need is what\u2019s driven Viasat to advance the availability of internet over satellite. Where cables and terrestrial wireless can\u2019t or won\u2019t go, satellite will, and it\u2019s increasingly clear that satellite will be the technology to take the Web to many of the places it couldn\u2019t go before.\nIf you want to know more about the World Wide Web, check out the book \u201cWeaving the Web\u201d by Berners-Lee himself.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T17:58:14Z", "url": "https://corpblog.viasat.com/august-1-is-world-wide-web-day/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "I write this from Ben Gurion airport, the Dan lounge to be exact, a perk left over from my pre-B\u2019nai Abraham frequent flyer days. It\u2019s late Thursday evening, boarding begins in an hour or so, and it\u2019s nice to sit comfortably and relax.\nI\u2019ve been in Israel for almost two full weeks, perhaps my longest stay since student days thirty-five years ago. The visit has been energizing. Robin and I arrived with a wonderful group of thirty from TBA, all adults, all eager to see the land, in some cases for the first time, in others for the first time in a long while. It was a congenial, fun group, and delightfully prompt, even with a few early morning departures.\nSome of what we did was different. For example, no zip lining down the Manara Cliffs this time\u2026though I bet these folks would have been up to it! But there were other, more important differences as well.\nI kept reminding my companions that Israel was complicated\u2026and they saw this for themselves. A number of speakers shared their views with us: a much decorated army colonel, a center right journalist and a center left Tel Aviv University professor among them. We worked hard to learn about and understand the many views on the international and domestic challenges Israel faces, like Iran, the West Bank, economic disparity and women\u2019s rights.\nFriday night Robin and I went to Kibbutz Tzuba, near Jerusalem. Robin directs admissions for a high school semester-in-Israel program and we had Shabbat dinner with \u201cher\u201d kids. That was fun. The rest of the group attended services at a local Reform synagogue and were hosted for dinner by member families. The next morning on the bus, everybody had stories to tell and it appears lots of email addresses were exchanged. We also heard that lots of delicious food got served\u2026though not, it appears, in every house!\nLast Sunday was, to be sure, our most serious day, and perhaps the most memorable. A remarkable young man named Avner, from a group called Breaking the Silence, led us on a tour of Hebron, in the heart of the West Bank. Few Jews go there and the city center, where a small group of right wing settlers have been ensconced for years, is incredibly heavily guarded. It was impossible to avoid seeing the impact of this presence and to say we were all uncomfortable is an understatement.\nLater, we visited a wonderful woman named Barbara who lives in Gush Etzion, surely the least controversial part of the West Bank. While we may not have agreed with everything she said, we could not help but admire her commitment to her community, and especially, her affirmation that if real peace could be achieved, and her moving would make the difference, she would.\nThese two worlds were new to all of us, but helped us understand the Israel of today better.\nI cannot write even an incomplete account of our journey without mentioning dinner on February 12. Somehow or other \u2013 I truly have no idea how! \u2013 the restaurant where we ate dinner learned that it was both Robin and Nancy Bernstein\u2019s birthday. We had a wonderful meal right on Lake Kinneret (aka the Sea of Galilee) when suddenly the lights went off, the boat on which we had earlier briefly cruised pulled away from shore, and in the celebrants\u2019 honor we witnessed an amazing fireworks display. And that was only the beginning.\nNeedless to say, Robin and Nancy asked Ken and me what we have planned for next year!\nAt times it felt like we were on information overload as the experiences and the conversations and the new sights and new people got to be\u2026well, a lot. But we were all sad to leave one another and I know that ties to Israel have been strengthened and all of us have a better grasp of Israel than we did before\u2026and are glad of it. And we are also glad of the strong ties all of us now share.\nSo everybody else left and I (literally) wheeled my suitcase across the street from the Dan Panorama Jerusalem to the Hotel Prima Royale (which for the record is neither). I joined an already in progress rabbinic mission from our Greater Metrowest Federation. For the last three days, ten of us rabbis (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and me) met and toured with academics and tour guides and officials from the World Zionist Organization and the Foreign Ministry, in effect receiving a crash course in Israeli politics and foreign affairs. This was unquestionably a case of information overload, thought it was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had.\nI\u2019ll need some time to process all we learned but perhaps the neatest part of the experience \u2013 and one I didn\u2019t even think about previously \u2013 was being with such a diverse and wonderful group. The ten of us became fast friends, sharing thoughts and dreams, concerns and worries. We found that though we represented a quite diverse ideological spectrum, our lives were more similar than we would have imagined. Happily, the date for a reunion lunch has already been marked.\nSo now it\u2019s time to come home, and I m excited about that\u2026yes, to see Robin, and also because I know it will be warm and I assume our driveway will have been shoveled!

{"text": "I. Causes of Heart Failure: What every physician needs to know.\nHeart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome in which the heart is unable to provide sufficient blood flow to meet the metabolic needs of the body, or is only able to do so with significantly increased intracardiac filling pressure. However, this is a somewhat older definition, and many people now define heart failure as a clinical syndrome where there is structural heart disease and impaired function.\nHeart failure is often referred to as congestive heart failure (CHF). Many experts believe that the term \u201ccongestion\u201d does not uniformly apply to all patients, and the syndrome is often referred to as \u201cheart failure\u201d in more contemporary times.\nHeart failure is most often characterized as systolic, if ejection fraction (EF) is decreased, and diastolic, if ejection fraction is preserved. \u201cDiastolic\u201d heart failure is also often called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) or heart failure with preserved systolic function (HFPSF).\nSystolic heart failure is often due to damage to the heart, such as ischemia or alcohol exposure. Diastolic heart failure is often due to longstanding hypertension or intracardiac infiltration such as with amyloid protein, which \u201cstiffens\u201d both ventricles. It is not usually possible to distinguish systolic from diastolic heart failure based on signs and symptoms alone, as both share substantial clinical features.\nII. Diagnostic Confirmation: Are you sure your patient has Heart Failure?\nHeart failure is diagnosed at the bedside using history and physical findings. There is no absolute laboratory test for the diagnosis of heart failure.\nA characteristic history includes exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and edema. Physical exam would be notable for volume overload (jugular venous distention, dependent edema), S3 gallop, and often pulmonary rales.\nHowever, it is important to note that the absence of rales does not exclude heart failure, as the lymphatic system can provide substantial compensation, particularly in patients with chronic heart failure. Pulmonary congestion is typically evident on chest radiography.\nPlasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) levels are typically elevated, although renal failure and obesity are commonly recognized confounders. The hallmark laboratory exam of heart failure is an echocardiogram.\nThe presence of a decreased EF is sufficient to give a diagnosis of systolic heart failure; other modalities such as gated nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or gated computed tomography (CT) are also able to determine EF.\nDiastolic heart failure is diagnosed in the presence of the clinical syndrome of heart failure with preserved EF. Efforts should be made to determine the etiology of heart failure.\nExertional dyspnea and fatigue are virtually universal. Volume overload is usually found, but in the modern era of powerful loop diuretics, some patients do not manifest fluid overload.\nNocturnal symptoms such as orthopnea and/or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) are also highly suggestive of heart failure. Abdominal discomfort or fullness is also a frequently reported symptom. Patients with well-compensated heart failure may have minimal symptoms and no evidence of volume overload. Characteristics of end-stage heart failure may include cachexia and Cheyne-Stokes respirations.\nApproximately half of patients with heart failure have systolic failure and the other half have diastolic heart failure. Some have features of both types. Heart failure is perhaps more common in men and in those who identify as black racially.\nRisk increases with age. Regardless, the most important risk factors for developing heart failure on a population basis are hypertension, myocardial infarction, and diabetes.\nThe majority of diastolic heart failure is a result of longstanding hypertension, and this phenotype of heart failure is more common in women. Infiltrative diseases, such as amyloidosis and hemochromatosis, also typically lead to diastolic heart failure, often with restrictive physiology.\nPrior chest radiation is another potential cause of diastolic heart failure, and the incidence may increase as prolonged cancer survivorship increases. Once patients are hospitalized with diastolic heart failure, the prognosis is approximately the same as systolic heart failure.\nHypertension and diabetes also increase the risk of systolic heart failure through the increased risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarctions. Thus efforts to minimize coronary artery disease would be anticipated to have substantial impact on risk of developing heart failure.\nThe causes of systolic heart failure are myriad, including coronary artery disease, genetic or familial, viral (including HIV), idiopathic, valvular, inflammatory (myocarditis, sarcoidosis), thyroid disease, tachycardia-mediated (often from previously unrecognized atrial fibrillation), stress-induced (also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy), nutritional deficiency (such as thiamine or selenium), systemic myopathies (such as muscular dystrophies), and peripartum cardiomyopathy.\nAlcohol, cocaine, methamphetamines, anthracyclines, some antirheumatic medications (such as hydroxychloroquine) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are common toxic causes of heart failure, which are typically identified through patient history.\nCommon alternative causes of volume overload include renal failure, liver failure, and hypoalbuminemia. Common alternative causes of exertional breathlessness are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism (PE), and pneumonia. Coronary artery disease also may present with a dyspnea-predominant phenotype, rather than chest pain, as is classically expected.\nEvaluation of the central venous pressure is of the utmost importance.\nProfoundly low cardiac output states may be characterized by hypotension and/or narrow pulse pressure along with cool or mottled skin.\nSinus tachycardia is common but may be compensatory.\nChest x-ray (CXR) and EKG are essential in the evaluation of a patient with suspected heart failure. Beyond providing information supporting the diagnosis of heart failure, these diagnostic tests often provide an alternative diagnosis (atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, lung mass, etc.) that implies heart failure may not be the key diagnosis.\nEchocardiogram is also essential and will provide substantial information about the size, structure, and function of the heart. MRI, which provides detailed information on the myocardium, should be considered.\nMRI can provide strong, noninvasive evidence of etiology in many cases, such as prior infarction, myocarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular noncompaction, stress or \u201cTakotsubo\u201d cardiomyopathy, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, or hemochromatosis, for example. Positron emission tomography (PET) can also be used to diagnose cardiac sarcoidosis.\nEndomyocardial biopsy should be considered in highly select circumstances, such as suspicion of myocarditis. Biopsy also has a role in defining the subtype of amyloid cardiomyopathy (e.g., transthyretin versus amyloid light-chain (AL)). Patients with a family history of cardiomyopathy should be offered the option of referral for genetic counseling and testing.\nBNP (or NT-proBNP) should be considered, particularly if other causes of dyspnea such as COPD are being considered if there is doubt about the diagnosis. Very low levels virtually exclude heart failure, but can be confounded by obesity.\nElevated levels can be seen in renal failure without substantial heart failure, but at least suggest volume overload. Elevated BNP in the absence of renal failure is strongly suggestive of heart failure, but BNP levels are increased with age.\nBasic metabolic parameters including renal and hepatic function should be measured. Renal dysfunction may be a seen as a result of low cardiac output or elevated venous filling pressure.\nHepatic parameters (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) and international normalized ratio (INR) may be elevated as a consequence of hepatic congestion. Serum albumin is helpful in excluding malnutrition as an alternative explanation for peripheral edema.\nMinor elevations in troponin are characteristic of heart failure exacerbation, but typically do not rise and fall as in acute coronary syndrome; myocarditis should be considered if troponin is substantially elevated. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) would also be typically elevated in myocarditis, but are not diagnostic if elevated. Anemia (hemoglobin or hematocrit) and gout (uric acid) and are also frequent comorbidities to consider.\nAdditional testing to establish the etiology of heart failure should be considered and may include: HIV, ferritin (hemochromatosis), thyroid-stimulating hormone, and serum free light chains (amyloid), for example. Testing for specific viruses other than HIV is not routinely performed, but Coxsackie, Epstein-Barr, and varicella zoster could be considered. Exclusion of connective tissue disease with antinuclear antibodies (ANA) is also often performed.\nCXR film (Figure 1) may show cardiomegaly, but the absence does not exclude heart failure. Pulmonary edema is an important finding, but can be confused with pneumonitis or other causes of diffuse infiltrates. Accompanying findings such as pleural effusions may be helpful in interpretation.\nChest x-ray film demonstrating cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.\nAn echocardiogram will provide size; structural detail, including evaluation of valves; and myocardial function, including EF and presence of absence of regional wall motion abnormalities. This is the most important test when considering heart failure as a diagnosis.\nAbdominal ultrasound may demonstrate hepatomegaly and/or ascites, although these findings are often evident on exam and thus are not routinely indicated.\nThe hallmarks of treatment of diastolic heart failure are control of congestion, heart rate in the presence of atrial fibrillation to increase ventricular filling time, and control of systolic blood pressure. The majority of evidence on the treatment of heart failure has been for systolic heart failure, and is thus the focus of the remainder of this section.\nThere are three \u201cto do\u2019s\u201d in the management of heart failure: (1) control congestion, (2) provide neurohormonal antagonists, and (3) consider sudden cardiac death prevention and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Since congestion causes most symptoms, this should be prioritized.\nCongestion control is achieved with sodium and sometimes (if there is hyponatremia) moderate fluid restriction; most patients need loop diuretics. Congestion is managed the same for systolic and diastolic heart failure.\nSecond, neurohormonal antagonists (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and vasodilators in select populations) are critical for the treatment of systolic heart failure and should be initiated. Although it is critical to use the drugs and doses that were found to be effective in landmark clinical trials, very few patients will tolerate initiation of full doses of these medications, and a period of uptitration over several weeks to months should be anticipated.\nThere is no consensus regarding whether beta-blockers or ACEI/ARB should be initiated first, and beta-blockers should be avoided in the setting of cardiogenic shock, severe bradycardia, complete heart block, or bronchospasm. Studies of neurohormonal antagonists for diastolic heart failure have been disappointing, but neurohormonal antagonists are still often used for their antihypertensive effect, and their safety in this population is well-established.\nAlthough there is no mortality benefit, digoxin has been noted to improve symptoms and reduce the risk of hospitalization. Finally, consideration should be given to \u201celectrical therapy,\u201d which consists of CRT (if QRS >130 ms) and sudden cardiac death prevention with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).\nThe risk of sudden cardiac death is much higher with an EF <35%, and in the absence of contraindications such as life expectancy less than 1 year, electrical therapy should be considered. Patients should be receiving optimal medical therapy for at least 3 months before implanting an ICD.\nWearable external defibrillators are sometimes used during the period of medical uptitration to permit reevaluation of EF; a sizable fraction of patients will improve on medical therapy to the point that an implantable ICD is not indicated.\nPatients who are unable to tolerate medical therapy or experience progression despite these therapies suggest a very poor prognosis and may be considered for advanced options, such as mechanical circulatory support (MCS, also known as ventricular assist device or VAD) or heart transplant.\nACEI/ARB and beta-blockers are both initiated at minimal dose, but uptitration of ACEI/ARB is typically prioritized, as full dose can typically be achieved more quickly. Beta-blocker dose is then increased every 1 to 2 weeks to the maximally tolerated dose. Timing of the introduction of aldosterone antagonist is individualized based on need for diuretics and potassium supplementation, and often deferred to prioritize ACEI/ARB and beta-blockers.\nAdministration of diuretics is the hallmark of emergency treatment of heart failure and most patients respond promptly. Inadequate response should precipitate rapid escalation of a diuretic dose.\nA common rule of thumb is to double an ineffective dose. Consideration should be given to vasodilators if systemic blood pressure is adequate (e.g., mean arterial pressure greater than 70 to 75 mm Hg). In the event of hypotension or cardiogenic shock, initiation of inotropes, such as dobutamine and/or dopamine, may be necessary. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is an option and mechanical support such as an intraaortic balloon pump may also be indicated.\nIn addition to evaluation of symptomatic response, physical exam findings that should be monitored while providing treatment for heart failure include frequent evaluation of jugular venous pressure and vital signs, with particular attention to blood pressure and heart rate. Sinus tachycardia is often a compensatory response and improvement is thought to represent a favorable response to treatment.\nSerial examinations should also focus attention on the presence of absence of S3/S4, liver span, presence or absence of ascites, and degree and distribution of edema. Urine output should also be monitored, as this provides the most direct measure of pace of decongestion and also indicates adequate (or not) renal perfusion.\nBasic metabolic panels are typically performed shortly after initiation of therapy (at least daily while hospitalized), to monitor renal function and ensure that diuretics are not causing dangerous perturbations in serum potassium levels. Following initiation of aldosterone antagonists, more frequent monitoring of potassium is indicated.\nA commonly used strategy is 1 week after initiation or dose increase, and then again at 1 month. Once a stable medication regimen has been established, routine intermittent testing in heart failure patients is not typically performed. There is some data to suggest that BNP levels may be used to guide therapy.\nMaintaining patients with heart failure on maximally tolerated doses of neurohormonal antagonists (ACEI/ARB, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists) are critical to minimizing risk of disease progression, symptomatic decompensation, hospitalization, and mortality. Application of CRT when indicated has also been shown to improve outcomes, and should be periodically reconsidered, as patient status or criteria for implant may change over time.\nEducation on salt avoidance, the role of fluid restriction, and self-care including daily weight monitoring are all important to reduce burden of disease and avoid hospitalization. Over time, it is not uncommon for patients with heart failure to become intolerant to maximal doses of medical therapy.\nThe need to decrease the doses of medications is a predictor of adverse outcome, and may be an appropriate time to consider evaluation for advanced options. For patients with end-stage disease, palliative care and/or hospice may be appropriate, and deactivation of ICD may be considered.\nDigoxin is sometimes used in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with insufficient rate control. Typical dose is 62.5 to 250 mcg daily.\nConcurrent anemia: Treatment may improve heart failure symptoms.\nConcurrent arrhythmias: Consider the role that uncontrolled arrhythmias may have on heart failure exacerbation. Improved control of atrial fibrillation or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) may improve symptoms. Many antiarrhythmics are contraindicated in severe heart failure.\nConcurrent chronic kidney disease: Continue ACEI/ARB if possible, but if necessary to discontinue, replace with isosorbide/hydralazine combination. May contribute to anemia. Aldosterone antagonists have a substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia.\nConcurrent diabetes: Avoid thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in all heart failure patients and metformin if there is significant renal dysfunction.\nConcurrent gout: It is likely that diuretic dosing will need to be increased if a gout flareup is treated with steroids.\nConcurrent liver disease: Liver congestion is common and may result in the need to alter dose of medications metabolized by the liver.\nConcurrent prostatic hypertrophy: Alpha blockers should be avoided, as they have been shown to increase mortality in heart failure patients.\nConcurrent sleep apnea: Should be treated aggressively to minimize neurohormonal activation.\nAldosterone antagonists should not be used in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease.\nConsider use of the Seattle Heart Failure Model or the Heart Failure Survival Score for estimating a patient\u2019s prognosis.\nConsider referral to dietitian to augment teaching on importance of low-salt diet.\nWeigh yourself at the same time every day and record the result. Report increases of more than 3 lb in a day or 5 lb in a week to your doctor; however, not all decompensations are preceded by antecedent weight gain.\nAvoid sodium intake and strive to keep less than 2,000 mg daily.\nTake your medications as prescribed every day.\nReport changes in symptoms promptly.\n\u201c2009 Focused update incorporated into the ACC/AHA 2005 guidelines for the diagnosis and management of heart failure in adults: A report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines.

{"text": "Experimental design and architectural firm, D*Haus Company, takes their inspiration for the creation of structures, furniture, and lighting from mathematics, most specifically from Henry Ernest Dudeney, the mathemetician who figured out how to evolve a perfect square into an equilateral triangle.\nTheir D*Haus modular homes demonstrate their belief that ideas \u201ccan help improve and inspire our daily lives\u2026 through flexibility, adaptability and originality.\u201d Available in four different versions, the D*Haus can be delivered in a single kit from which a minimum of eight configurations can be constructed.\nFrom a single D*Static kit of identical parts, eight different houses can be affordably constructed. Dubbed as \u201cone of the most economic and sustainable ways of building prefabricated homes,\u201d the D*Static can be built into as many as five bedrooms in one- or two-story configurations. Each kit is constructed off-site from cross-laminated timber, so that on-site construction can happen in a matter of days. Facade panels are made of highly available and sustainable arctic spruce. Window glazing allows for passive gain of incoming solar energy and outstanding U-values are achieved from super insulation.\nThe upscale D*Lux version for luxury homes will also permit eight different versions of a home to be built from a single kit. Made from high-quality materials while utilizing the same process as in the D*Static model, the D*Lux home is eco-friendly and sustainable while featuring larger living areas, balconies, porches, and standard swimming pools in hot climates.\nFrom the D*Modular kit, an infinite number of houses can be built. With a focus on sustainability, efficiency, and flexibility, the D*Modular home can grow as you grow.\nThe centerpiece of the D*Haus collection is the D*Dynamic, billed as \u201ca house for all seasons.\u201d The D*Dynamic is capable of dynamic response to the environment by \u201ccontrolled adaptation to seasonal, meteorological and astronomical conditions.\u201d Moving inside itself, the D*Dynamic transforms into eight different configurations in response to changes in seasons and time of day. Heavy external walls can unfold into internal walls, permitting glass internal walls to transform into facades, changing the shape and perspective of the building to take advantage of environmental energy sources.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T02:51:28Z", "url": "http://www.jetsongreen.com/2013/03/a-house-for-all-seasons-dhaus-8-in-1-modular-is-a-house-for-all-people.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Hi everyone. Firstly I must apologise for the lack of blog posts in the last few weeks; in fact since 5 March when I posted the last one. I've had a manically busy few weeks having taken on a number of new clients. Also, I am preparing for a photo shoot of my flat in mid April which has been stressing me out somewhat. So I've been furiously upcycling some of my furniture with Annie Sloan paint (separate blog post shortly) and changing lampshades on all my table lamps.\nTable lamps can be so boring and serve no other purpose than to provide a lighting source. Gone are the days when you only had a limited choice of shades, mainly 50 shades of beige or cream!! Now you can buy the most divine shades and make a real statement, a wow factor, even if the lamp base is a bit \"meh\". The reverse is a statement lamp base with a plain shade that doesn't compete. However, beware as you can spend hundreds of pounds on a lamp shade and even thousands of pounds on a lamp base. It's a matter of finding something affordable and you really love.\nThere is a great shop in London called Pooky Lighting which sells affordable and fun lamp bases and shades so I popped in and bought three pairs of lampshades for the bedrooms and kitchen. What a difference they have made to the rooms; the lighting has transformed the spaces from \"meh\" to \"tah-dah\" !!!\nIn the kitchen I changed the shades from plain taupe coloured silk to these gorgeous silk Ikat pleated shades by Pooky Lights. In the sitting room I replaced a pair of beige linen shades in the alcoves with black & white Ikat ones which really draw the eye in.\nAnd finally, I bought a rather expensive but absolutely divine lamp base from Nicholas Haslam designed by Paolo Moschino. It is my piece de resistance but one of those items that you see and just have to have!! It is solid handcarved brass and it was the way it opened up like a flower and had such beautiful flowing lines that made me fall in love with it. The jury is out on whether any of my friends like it !!\nI would love to hear what sort of table lamps you have and would be happy to offer some advice if you are thinking of changing them so do contact me.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T15:03:05Z", "url": "https://www.angelabuntcreative.com/flairfairy/tag/Lighting", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Check out our recipe for a Southern classic, BBQ Shrimp & Grits.\n**To coarse-grind the peppercorns, use a blender or peppermill. The grind is important to the taste of the finished dish.\nPlace the shrimp, Worcestershire, pepper, Creole seasoning, garlic, and 1 tablespoon water in a heavy 10-inch, stainless-steel saut\u00e9 pan. Squeeze the juice from the lemon half over the shrimp and add the rind and pulp to the pan.\nOver high heat, cook the shrimp while gently stirring and occasionally turning the shrimp.\nIf the shrimp are the colossal size, add 2 tablespoons water to the pan. Otherwise, don\u2019t add water.\nReduce the heat to medium-high and continue cooking as you gradually add the cold pieces of butter to the pan. While turning the shrimp occasionally, swirl the butter pieces until they are incorporated into the pan juices, the sauce turns light brown and creamy as it simmers, and the shrimp are just cooked through. This will take about two minutes total if the shrimp are extra-large, and about three minutes total if they\u2019re colossal. Do not overcook the shrimp.\nCombine the grits, chicken stock, heavy cream, a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper in a pot. Bring to a boil and reduce to a slow simmer.\nStir the grits frequently to prevent sticking and burning.\nContinue to cook on a slow simmer making sure to constantly stir the grits if they get to thick before they are tender.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T08:30:16Z", "url": "http://www.neworleansrestaurants.com/new-orleans-recipes/recipes-ralphs-shrimp-grits.php", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "May is a busy month, with various key dates of celebration and recognition. Over the course of the month, i am going to share with you some tools and suggestions. First up, in honour of Maternal Mental Health Week, here is a tool that i put together. After studying both Dialectical Behaviour Therapy as well as more body-based self-compassion modalities, i find this tool can be helpful to help you take control of your emotions. I love acronyms as it makes it so much easy to remember the suggestions. Plus it\u2019s a helpful reminder that we can be in control of our feelings.\nIt can be hard to take time for yourself, especially when we are told to take care of others and that it\u2019s selfish to do kind things for ourselves. This tool can be a great way for you to steal some moments to yourself, in an intentional way. It also can manifest some good feelings that linger. Rainbows are incredible symbols of everyday magic or woo woo, and taking time to notice the joy and beauty in the everyday helps us with our emotional well-being. We deserve to notice these moments, and deserve to take time to pause.\nIt\u2019s important to slow down and catch your breath. We can only see rainbows when we are able to be aware of what\u2019s in front of us. This is also a great way to notice what we need an a given moment. What can you do in this moment to rest and relax? Can you put your feet up and just take in the sights and sounds around you? Linger a bit longer in the shower, add some luxurious hand lotion to your sensory self-care. Have a cat-nap. Maybe treat yourself to a nice mala bracelet with your favourite crystal \u2013 this can be a calming tool and a way to practice some mindful meditation.\nRadical Acceptance is a helpful tool to be able to acknowledge something for what it is. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to truly agree with it, but the acceptance can be a first step to let things go. This stops the pain from turning into suffering, and it allows us to be more present with ourselves in the present. When we don\u2019t accept something, it keeps us stuck. So, try working with this idea and practice saying \u201cit is what it is.\u201d See how that starts to feel in your body. Maybe some parts feel less stuck or tight.\nSetting intentions for a day, a week, or a year can be a guide that sets you with following where your want your life to go. The intention can be a simple word that carries meaning for you, or a mantra/affirmation that holds significance for you. If you don\u2019t already have one, take some time to journal and brainstorm the words and phrases that are meaningful for you. It is a good way of giving ourselves permission to focus on what we really want, and to take ownership of our moods and behaviour. Then work on ways to implement it into your everyday life. Maybe there is a symbol that speaks to you as a guide \u2013 be it a rainbow of hope and luck, a butterfly of resilience, or a lavender flower that helps you feel calm. When you have a symbol that acts as Recalled Anchor (i wrote about it more here) or resource, seeing it in your everyday life is a great way to boost your mood.\nSelf-Compassion is not the same as self-esteem and yet they work well together. To have self-compassion, it implies that we need to treat ourselves with the loving kindness we give others when they need our support. Think of some ways to give yourself self-compassion \u2013 it can be a permission slip to eat some chocolate after a hard day, and to enjoy it without judgement. It can be to not do the dishes and instead watch some marathon TV. It can be a yoga stretch or dance to your favourite music. The compassion comes from reminding yourself that your matter and deserve this break.\nReading is a great way for your brain to take a break from the monkey mind or inner critic. It is especially helpful when we are able to distract ourselves from the everyday worries and thoughts. You can get your dog-eared favourite book, or a new book that you have never read; it can be a fiction novel, self-help book, or a how-to book for something you want to learn. Take time to write in your own journal, free writing or following a guide. If reading is not your thing, no worries. Listen to an audio book or a podcast. This podcast that talks more about everyday magic and woo woo is a great listen! Watch a movie that you have never seen before \u2013 the idea is to let your brain relax and absorb what it is taking in, instead of the constant chatter it typically takes you to.\nResearch has shown links to fresh air, being outdoors and mental health. Our brains are elastic and benefit from the change in scenery as well as air changes. Sensorimotor Psychotherapy and Polyvagal theory also show us that a quick walk outdoors can do a lot to change our mood. Everything is better outside. Think of some simple things you can do \u2013 a walk, sitting on your porch our balcony, a picnic snack during your lunch break for instance. Another benefit to getting outside is that there may be other people that you can connect with \u2013 it helps us feel less alone or isolated after being indoors when feeling down. You don\u2019t need to have a long chat with someone, but a quick hello can be a great break your mind and body needs too.\nIn keeping with Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs, it\u2019s imperative to take care of your basic needs. Research shows that we need to nurture our physical body in order to heal our mental health. Do a quick checklist \u2013 when was the last time you drank some water, had a healthy snack, slept enough, did some exercise for your body? If it\u2019s been 2 hours since your last water break, have a glass right now. And then find ways to allow time for the other ways to take care of your body.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T08:22:52Z", "url": "http://vaniasukola.ca/tag/self-care-toolkit/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Buy stocks now that will stand the test of time and pay you to invest.\nWe love talking about the hot stocks here on the blog but what about the stocks you can buy and know they\u2019ll produce solid returns for decades?\nHow do you find those forever stocks you can buy and just sit back and collect the checks?\nIt\u2019s something every investor needs to know. Gone are the days you could just park your money in huge companies like GE and feel confident that your money will be there when you retire.\nIn this video, I\u2019ll reveal the three factors I look for when buying stocks for the long-term and five stocks to buy right now.\nNow I love to buy deep-value stocks and benefit from that near-term rebound. Perfect example is the Hanesbrands position in our 2019 Stock Market Challenge. I saw rising online sales and strength in the activewear segment ahead of a 52% surge in the shares.\nBut you also need to be investing for the long-term, right? We want to be building a portfolio that benefits from quick wins but one where our stocks are going to withstand the test of time.\nFortunately, there is a way to get both. Get that short-term pop plus the long-term returns that will beat your investing goals, or as I call them, forever stocks.\nThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to be doing today. In this video, I\u2019ll show you the three factors I look for when picking stocks to buy for the long-term. I\u2019ll cover each factor then I\u2019m going to be revealing five stocks to buy right now that I think will produce those double-digit returns over the next 30 years.\nThe first factor I\u2019m looking for in forever stocks is a dividend yield and there are a few reasons for that.\nFirst is that, stocks that pay dividends just tend to do better. Now this graphic is a little jumbled but groups of stocks paying dividends and those with a history of growing their dividends are the blue lines at the top while no-dividend stocks and those cutting their cash payouts are the two bottom lines. The research this was based on has been sliced and diced every way but the simple truth is that dividend-paying companies beat the market.\nOne of the reasons for this is because that dividend payout acts as cash discipline on management. It\u2019s harder to spend on those questionable projects if you know you\u2019ve got to meet that $400 million dividend payment at the end of the quarter.\nThat dividend payment is like having some of your paycheck automatically invested instead of it sitting in your checking account tempting you to spend it on whatever commercial you see next. If you just don\u2019t have the money sitting around, you\u2019re less likely to spend it on stupid crap you don\u2019t need.\nAnother reason I want to be investing in dividend stocks is because it\u2019s always a positive return. This chart shows the percentage of return from dividends and price in each decade. Dividends might be a small part of your return when the market is booming like in the 90s but when the stock market crashes, that dividend return may be all you collect. Thirty years is a lot of bear markets so having those dividend stocks is going to be a lot of protection.\nNow when I\u2019m looking for dividend stocks, I want a company paying a yield of at least 2%. That\u2019s the average dividend yield on the S&P 500 so I like to look for stocks paying maybe a little above average.\nI also want to look at the payout ratio though and this is something we\u2019ve talked about before. The payout ratio is the percentage of profits paid out to cover the dividend. I like to see a payout ratio of 60% or less so I know the company is keeping enough money back for growth as well as making those cash payments.\nSo obviously you know I\u2019m all about dividend stocks but there\u2019s another side of investing, looking at companies with the fastest growth. Think names like Tesla, Netflix and Amazon. This growth investing can be just as profitable or more than dividend investing so I need your opinion. Which do you want to see more videos about, dividend or growth investing. Just scroll down below the video and let me know in the comments.\nAn important note here, any type of investing can get really expensive if you\u2019re buying and selling a lot. That\u2019s why I\u2019m using M1 Finance for our 2019 stock market challenge for a no-fee investing option that saves thousands.\nThe second factor I\u2019m looking for in these long-term stocks to buy is going to take advantage of big macro trends. This means finding companies that will benefit from those large, universal trends like aging populations, food demand, automation.\nWe\u2019re talking the massive, unstoppable forces that will unfold over decades. This kind of long-term investing is the best thing you can do for your portfolio and it\u2019s really how some of these hedge funds managers like Seth Klarman make their billions.\nThis is one of my favorite ways to invest because it makes it so easy. You\u2019re looking at these big trends and thinking, OK which sectors or industries of the economy will benefit? Those forces are going to drive demand for every company in that sector and industries so once you answer that question, you just look for the leaders in the group.\nThe best part is, you don\u2019t have to pick that one best company because all the players in the group will benefit from these massive shifts.\nSome of the biggest macro trends I\u2019m watching include aging populations, so the fact that 10,000 Americans are reaching retirement age everyday and that\u2019s going to affect everything from government services to consumer spending.\nFood demand, global agricultural production just isn\u2019t keeping up with demand, obviously automation and artificial intelligence will bring huge shifts in work and other areas.\nBig data, and especially with the coming 5G networks I think will bring a wave of changes. Finally the shift in economic and political strength to Asia and here we\u2019re not only talking about China which is the big one but also India and other parts of the region.\nThe third factor I\u2019m looking for in long-term stocks is going to be just as important and that\u2019s companies safe from the destruction in those macro trends. Just as a lot of opportunities are created from those massive trends, there\u2019s also going to be that creative destruction that is the hallmark of capitalism.\nWith this one, think of entire industries like newspapers and magazines. Think of once hugely successful companies like Kodak that, while it\u2019s survived, it\u2019s hard to argue that the company is the giant it used to be.\nHere I\u2019m thinking about industries at risk from automation and AI and we\u2019re not just talking about making the industry obsolete but the kind of change that will be hard for companies to keep up with.\nThere will always be a need for banking but the evolution to online banking, peer-to-peer lending and even digital currencies is making it very difficult for banks to keep up. You could have a best-of-breed bank stock but if they aren\u2019t constantly adapting to these changes, it\u2019s not going to last the thirty years.\nI\u2019m also looking at companies at risk to big regulatory concerns and what we\u2019ll just call Death-by-Amazon. So here I want to stay away from pharmacy retail and drug makers, not because I think those industries won\u2019t be around but because these big risks are evolving so quickly that a lot of companies won\u2019t be able to keep up.\nSo those three factors are guiding my long-term investments but of course, I\u2019m still doing that deep fundamental analysis when I pick stocks. I\u2019m looking at cash flows and profitability like we\u2019ve talked about in other videos and finding companies with a distinct advantage over competitors.\nI know it\u2019s a lot but nobody said finding the best stocks for the next 30 years would be easy. Now I\u2019m going to reveal five names that I think could make the cut. Some of these are going to be pretty safe bets while others could be a little more risky.\nOur first stock is an anchor for a lot of portfolios, Campbells Soup, ticker CPB. The $10 billion leader in packaged foods controls 60% of the canned soup market and a strong position in snacks and beverages. That kind of market share and size gives it negotiating power against retailers in shelf-space and pricing.\nManagement has made some missteps over the last couple of years but has also been the victim of some bad economics in food packaging. Food costs have been rising at around 3% annually but companies haven\u2019t been able to pass these increases on to customers so profitability has suffered. Shares have fallen about 45% since mid-2016 but represent some great value right now.\nManagement has already driven $550 million in cost savings and expects another $400 million through 2022 which should rekindle some profitability. They\u2019re also expecting to announce buyers for the international business and Bolthouse Farms Fresh segment by the end of the year. The two segments represent about $2.1 billion in revenue so I\u2019m modeling around $4 billion from buyers that will significantly help to pay down some of that debt that\u2019s acting as an overhang on the shares.\nEarnings are expected 0.8% lower over the next four quarters but the company has a strong history of beating expectations. I\u2019m forecasting $2.55 in earnings per share on stronger profitability which would put the shares around 14-times on a price-to-earnings basis.\nThe shares trade at a price of just 1.1-times sales which is a 40% discount to the five-year average and almost half the two-times average price-to-sales multiple in the industry so some good value here.\nBesides a great valuation, solid dividend and just the strength of the company\u2019s business, I love Campbells here for a potential catalyst. Activist hedge fund Third Point has been battling the company for years to unlock shareholder value and take control from the Dorrance family. The hedge fund owns about 7% of the shares and finally won an agreement last November to add two of its nominees to the board of directors.\nThat means shareholders have a strong voice on the board that is expert in increasing value. The hedge fund has said everything is on the table including a breakup of the company or asset sales to unlock value and investors get paid a 3.9% dividend while they wait.\nSo I like Campbells but you\u2019re thinking, mmmm I just don\u2019t see soup as a growth market that\u2019s going to jump over the next 30 years. What else ya got for me?\nChina Mobile, ticker CHL, hits our list of stocks to buy for the long-term next. Just about every U.S. company has a \u2018china\u2019 plan to break into some part of the world\u2019s second largest economy. Even though the U.S. economy is still about twice as big, China\u2019s economy is adding almost twice the value to its economy every year because it\u2019s growing so fast.\nGetting exposure to that growth through U.S. companies with sales in China just isn\u2019t enough. EVERY SINGLE INVESTOR needs to own some Chinese domestic stocks and China Mobile is one of my top picks.\nThe telecom company controls 61% of the 4G market and 60% of the total wireless market. With 916 million subscribers, it\u2019s the largest telecom in the world and despite this ginormous size already, it\u2019s still posting some astonishing growth. China Mobile also became the country\u2019s largest fixed broadband provider last year, controlling 42% of the market and accounting for 73% of all new broadband customers versus the other two telecoms China Unicom and China Telecom.\nChina is determined to be the leader in 5G, it\u2019s said so publicly and this is one of the first tech evolutions where it really has a chance to set the pace and it\u2019s going to do it. That\u2019s going to open up a lot of opportunity for telecoms and the broader economy. IoT smart connections among corporate clients increased 154% in the first half of last year to 384 million, that\u2019s already more than the entire population of the United States.\nBehind all this growth is also one of the strongest balance sheets I\u2019ve seen with $70 billion in cash, that\u2019s more than 30% of the company\u2019s stock market value. For comparison, Apple\u2019s cash stock pile is less than 10% of its market value and China Mobile is generating over $7.6 billion in free cash flow every year.\nShares pay a 3.9% dividend yield and the company pays out 48% of profits to the dividend which is solid but still obviously leaves lots of money for growth. At a price-to-sales ratio of two-times which is just under the 2.15-times average over the last five years, the shares aren\u2019t a bargain here but the long-term potential is undisputed.\nThere is one major drawback to China Mobile, the controlling ownership by the Chinese government. As the controlling shareholder and regulator of all three domestic telecom operators, the government is a limiting force on how powerful any one company can become. In fact, over the last decade, it\u2019s swapped out the CEOs of the companies twice to try distributing management experience and knowledge. The upside to all of this is that the Chinese market will continue to grow and the government wouldn\u2019t consider letting anyone else play beyond the three established companies so you basically have an implicit guarantee for China Mobile.\nConAgra Foods, ticker CAG, is one I added to our 2019 Dividend Portfolio in February. The company is a U.S. powerhouse in prepared meals where it\u2019s the second-largest in the industry. It has a 40% market share in canned tomatoes and more than a fifth of the meat snacks market with Slim Jim. The company has some solid brands in that relatively safer consumer staples sector so we\u2019re talking dividends as well as a recession-proof industry.\nManagement fumbled big time with last year\u2019s Pinnacle acquisition and had to lower the profit outlook by 20% late last year. The problems were centered around Pinnacle\u2019s distribution business so a little harder to read but management has been very transparent since December about its plans going forward. I think they\u2019re being overly conservative on estimates for a 5% sales decline and margin loss on the Pinnacle assets so the next surprise could be on the upside when things come out better than expected.\nDespite the missteps, the Pinnacle deal still brought a lot of opportunity to the company with a position in the faster-growing frozen foods space. Consumer data is showing millennials are adopting frozen meals at a higher rate than previous generations and it\u2019s hard to imagine a tech shift that could put this industry in jeopardy.\nShares of ConAgra pay a 3.9% dividend which management has affirmed with its new 2019 outlook and trade for just 9.9-times trailing earnings, that\u2019s a 41% discount to the price multiple where it was trading in November. Cash flow is still solid and management is expecting $215 million in cost savings through 2022 on the acquisition. The average analyst price target is 50% higher than the current price and even the lowest price target is 8% higher.\nNext we have the Vanguard Real Estate ETF, ticker VNQ, which is probably my favorite exchange traded fund and another in our 2019 challenge portfolio. It holds shares of 187 real estate companies spread across all the property types and across the United States.\nEveryone in the community knows I\u2019m a huge believer in real estate. I got my first professional job as a commercial property analyst while in college, I\u2019ve managed my own rental properties and have seen real estate create more fortunes than any other asset. Real estate is truly a generational wealth-builder and will always be in demand.\nThe fund pays a 4.2% dividend yield and has returned 14.7% annually over the last decade. Beyond the solid cash yield and return, this is a great opportunity to take a little risk out of the stock market and have it in a real physical asset like property.\nThe fund has been under pressure over the last couple of years because of those rising interest rates. Obviously with the leverage used in real estate, any time you have rising rates, that\u2019s going to weigh on returns but the Fed has signaled no more rate hikes this year and that could unleash a lot of value in real estate.\nWe saw the real estate fund in blue here outperforming stocks through 2017 when rates started heading higher. Looking more recently with that market crash last year and we\u2019re seeing real estate outperform again.\nNow I know I said I wanted to stay away from pharmaceutical stocks because of that potential for regulatory problems over drug prices but I think Cardinal Health, ticker CAH, deserves a spot on the list. The $15 billion leader in medical supplies and pharmaceutical distribution to hospitals and pharmacies is diversified enough that I think it can withstand some of that regulatory risk.\nThe biggest reason I\u2019d overlook that risk of problems with drug pricing is the company\u2019s position in one of the biggest and surest demographic trends, the aging population. The very middle of the Baby Boomer generation, those born in 1955, turn 64 years old this year. That still puts a tidal wave of people over the next two decades that will be increasing the demand for healthcare.\nBetween AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, these three companies control 90% of the pharmaceutical wholesale market in the country. Even if we do see true enthusiasm for drug price controls from the government, which is a long-shot to start, then I think it\u2019s likely the industry can negotiate a compromise that still maintains solid profits while moderating price increases.\nManagement has identified over $300 million in cost savings it can drive this year and next which could rocket free cash flow. Shares pay a 3.8% dividend yield and the payout has grown at an 8% annualized clip over the last five years.\nAnalysts are only expecting 2.4% earnings growth to $5.10 per share over the next year but the company has a history of thrashing expectations. Over the last two years, management has surprised on the upside by 14% over expectations with even stronger results lately. Even the estimate though puts the shares at 10-times earnings so definitely some value in this one.\nFinding stocks to buy now isn\u2019t the only question you need to ask as investor. It\u2019s just as important to find the investments that will not only grow your money but the companies that will be around when you retire. Use a few basic screens and analysis to find these forever stocks to invest your money and have the confidence that it will be there when you need it.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T20:22:51Z", "url": "https://mystockmarketbasics.com/stocks-to-buy-now-hold-forever/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Chief Servant Adama Barrow just concluded his two-week long meet the people\u2019s tour where he made several promises. Reading various media reports I got to understand that these promises form part of 42 projects that are identified under his National Development Plan.\nSince the days of Jawara and then Yaya Jammeh we have these presidential countrywide tours where numerous promises are made. In most cases these promises are not fulfilled but get repeated at every tour.\nThis trend has to stop. But if only citizens begin to actively identify these promises in order to track their implementation.\nCitizens in each and every village, town, ward, district or region must begin to list these promises made to them so that after the tour they start the process of following up with the relevant Government institutions as well as their National Assembly Member and Local Government Chairperson, Governor and Mayor to ensure that the promises that the Chief Servant gave them are fulfilled.\nThis is the only way we will end the usual practice of empty promises imposed on citizens by politicians. This is the only way we will make our presidents honest and effective. This is the only way citizens will ensure that no politicians and public officers take them for a ride.\nTherefore, to start that process, I have gone through various media reports to capture some of the promises made by the Chief Servant Adam Barrow and some of his ministers during the tour. I urge you to also go back to those reports to identify which promise was made to your village or town or ward or district or region. We must not let Adama Barrow treat us as how DK Jawara and Yaya Jammeh treated us.\n11. To build fish processing factories and storage facilities in Tanji and Brufut that would create more than 20, 000 jobs. Work to begin 2019.\n15. To make Jarra and Kiang the first to benefit from national electricity roadmap.\n19. Minster of Education Claudiana Cole promised Kombo North a new and accessible senior secondary school for the district if the people can provide land.\n26. A digital register that would register all pregnant women in the country to enable health workers to monitor, respond and send alerts to them.\nWhat was promised to your village or town or region? Find out and start tracking the fulfilment of the promises. Promises, when made, are to be kept and not broken!\nCSOs and NAMs and other stakeholder must also follow up on these promises. Let us help Barrow fulfil his promises!\nAdamas\u2019 track record has so far failed the apt title of \u201cchief servant\u201d after merely one and a half year in office. He is gradually turning into a tyrant, warning would-be protesters about severe consequences Jammeh-style, and demeaning Gambian political activists abroad (I have a problem with the term diasporans, whatever that means). Don\u2019t shy away from the term a dictator in the making, Madi.\nWe are witnessing glaring similarities between Adama and the past FAILED presidents of the republic. That should be a call for more vigilance and scrutiny of all aspects and branches of an administration that is evidently taking us downhill. Nevertheless, expecting any different results from Adama and Ousainou, from that of Dawda and Yaya will be pure insanity.\nMadi keep up the unflinching loyalty to your people and the truth.\nI say jerre jeff, njaraama, abaaraka.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T12:33:01Z", "url": "https://www.jollofnews.com/2018/08/06/building-the-new-gambia-with-madi-jobarteh-tracking-barrows-promises/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

In the first half of this year alone we have seen some major announcements from Google AdWords that have shaken up the world of ecommerce and paid advertising in 2016.\nDuring the Google Performance Summit held earlier this year the search giant introduced new upgrades, features, designs and product types to its AdWords and Analytics platforms. We take a look at the four that caught our attention in relation to paid advertising.\nHigh on Google\u2019s list of things to do for 2017 is the redesign of its AdWords user interface. This is because many people find the current AdWords dashboard to be quite tricky when it comes to finding the data and insights you need.\nThe new interface is designed to bring the most important features together to allow a quick overview of the campaign. This will allow all parties to better communicate account insights and facts and redirect your attention to optimising elements that have the most impact.\nPay-per-Click helps you target your ads to customers in certain countries, regions or cities \u2013 or within a set distance from your business or shop. Your business gets found by people on Google precisely when they\u2019re searching for the things that you offer.\nIn February this year Google announced that it was doing away with right side ads in a bid to bring uniformity to the Google experience across devices. With this came the introduction of expanded text ads. What this means for advertisers is that headlines are now much bigger as in two 30-character headlines bigger. This is a step up from the single headline with just 25 characters.\nThis has huge implications for advertisers. Google has already reported a 25% increase in click through rates for advertisers as a result of the change.

So, they keep questioning our unity,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNeither Anna Hazare nor me claimed that we were going to unite our two campaigns. But we\u2019ll keep coming together whenever needed just like we have planned for June 3,\u201d he said.\nRamdev said there was no rift between him and Hazare, and that their \u201cfrequencies matched\u201d.\nHe said just and equitable institutions needed to be put in place of corrupt institutions. For this, he would keep a fast along with Hazare at Jantar Mantar on June 3.\nDuring the press meet, Ramdev also announced his itinerary for the thrid part of his Bharat Swabhiman Yatra. He said the journey would start May 1 and end June 3 with the fast at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi.\n\u201cDuring the \u2018yatra,\u2019 people in power will try to malign me, which is expected. But when that happens, I request the media to also hear our side of the story so that the complete picture can come out in the public,\u201d he said.\nAfter a gap of six months portals of famous Himalayan shrine Kedarnath today reopened for pilgrims. The temple, situated in Rudraprayag district at a height of 3,584 meter, was reopened at 0715 hours in the morning according to \u2018mahurat\u2019, sources said.\nThe \u2018mahurat\u2019 was decided on Mahashivrati at Ukhimath area on February 20. The head priest of the temple, Rawal, performed the \u2018Abhishek\u2019 after openeing of the doors, sources said. Thousands of pilgrims flocked the temple after opening of the doors.\nThe Chardhams, comprising the shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri in Garhwal Himalayas reopen for pilgrims in April-May every year after remaining closed for nearly six months during winters as the area remain snow-bound during the period.

It is the duty of media\u201d, he said.

I am a die-hard fan of Sachin\u2026he is a pride\u2026jewel of India. But I am not happy that he is a Rajya Sabha member\u2026.he should have been the way he is,\u201d Dutt said.\nWhen asked if being a parliamentarian will be too demanding for Rekha and Sachin, Bachchan said, \u201cIt is their personal decision\u2026leave it to them\u201d.

As planned, on April 27-28, the satellite propulsion system was used in four orbital manoeuvres to raise the height of the orbit of RISAT-1 to 536 km,\u201d ISRO said in a statement here.\nThe satellite is now in its final orbital configuration and in good health. In the coming days, various elements of the C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar will be tested and calibrated as a prelude to payload operations, it said.\n\u201cAs compared to the optical remote sensing satellites that depend upon sunlight, the Synthetic Aperture Radar of RISAT-1 transmits its own radar pulses (at 5.35 GHz) to study the objects on Earth. This facilitates (i) cloud penetration and (ii) imaging even without sunlight. For RISAT-1, imaging sessions around both 6 AM and 6 PM have been chosen,\u201d it said.\nThe 1,858 kg RISAT-1, whose images will facilitate agriculture and disaster management, was launched on board the PSLV-C19 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, around 90 km from Chennai.\nThe Amnesty International has appealed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to take steps for immediate release of all protesters arrested in connection with the anti-Koodankulam Nuclear plant agitation and drop \u201cfalse\u201d charges against them.\nAmnesty International members also referred to S.P.Udhayakumar, PMANE convenor\u2019s charge that the Indian authorities had \u201cfailed\u201d to respond satisfactorily to several site and safety concerns raised by an independent group of experts.\nThey expressed \u201cdismay\u201d that officials belonging to the Home Ministry searched Udhayakumar\u2019s home and that police had \u201charassed\u201d shop-keepers who were in solidarity with the protesters.\n\u201cThe charges against the protesters constitute a deliberate attempt by the authorities to silence them despite the fact that the protests had been peaceful,\u201d the letter to the Prime Minister said.\nAmnesty International members who have signed the letter include senior functionary Peter Cattan of Switzerland. A copy of the letter was released to the press here today.\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh Saturday hinted at an impending hike in fuel prices saying that there is need for such an exercise to balance the effects of the spiralling oil import bill.\n\u201cWith imports accounting for about 80 percent of our crude supplies, the spiralling prices of crude in the international market have put a severe strain on our import bill,\u201d Singh said in a speech while inaugurating a refinery here.\n\u201cWe also need to rationalize prices and at the same time ensure that the poor and needy are shielded from the effects of such a rationalization,\u201d he said.\nThe prime minister\u2019s comments came in the wake of demands by oil marketing companies (OMCs) which say they either be allowed to raise petrol prices or the government should compensate them for the underrecoveries. The OMCs say their inability to raise prices from Dec 16, 2011 to March 31, 2012 has resulted in total under-recovery of Rs.2,287 crore.\n\u201cThe challenges we face on the energy front are formidable. We need adequate supplies of energy at affordable prices. Domestic sources of crude oil and gas are inadequate to meet the growing demands of our rapidly expanding economy,\u201d he said.\nIndia also needed to conserve energy and there was \u201cno room for inefficient and wasteful usage of fuel\u201d, said the prime minister.\nThe 60 Years of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s reign will be celebrated in Britain with Rajasthani touch.\nThe 11-member Jaipur Maharaja Brass Band will perform in London June 2 and 3 rubbing shoulders with famous artists like Elton John in presence of heads of several states and world renowned personalities.\n\u201cThe organising committee of these events examined our previous international performances over the past ten years and selected the Jaipur Maharaja Brass Band to perform at London,\u201d the band\u2019s group leader Amrit Hussain said.\n\u201cIt is a very big event and we are unable to express our happiness in words. We expect to enthrall the audience and our aim is to give a taste of Indian music to the international audience with Indian and Rajasthani traditional music with a mix of Western instruments,\u201d he added.\nThe band will use a mix of traditional Indian and Western instruments to perform popular Bollywood, jazz, pop and self-composed music, making it the first group from India to perform at such an event, Hussain claimed.\nHe said over the past nine years, the band has performed at about 600 concerts in 40 countries. It has participated in prestigious music festivals like Sziget (Hungary), Paleo (Switzerland), and Pori Jazz Fest (Finland).\nOriginating from Jaipur, the city of the maharajas, the band consists of seven to eight musicians, a female traditional Rajasthani dancer and a juggler or fire eater. They play a range of traditional brass instruments, including trumpets, trombones, tubas, clarinets, tabla, base drum and saxophones and perform traditional dances.\nAmrit said that roots of the Indian brass band music go deep into the subcontinent\u2019s colonial past.\n\u201cIntroduced in the middle of the 18th century by the British, thousands of brass bands play at carnivals, national or religious festivals and local marriage celebrations across the country. In Rajasthan alone, there are over 2,000 brass bands performing regularly,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe have tried to include in our team the best performers out of the 2,000-odd brass bands,\u201d he added.\nIn a move to curb corruption in government offices, Jharkhand Chief Minister Arjun Munda has given his consent to an ordinance to set up special courts which will have the power to seize/attach properties of corrupt officials.\n\u201cChief Minister Munda has given his approval to set up \u2018Jharkhand special court ordinance 2012\u2032. The ordinance has been sent to the governor for notification,\u201d an official of the Chief Minister\u2019s Office (CMO) told IANS Saturday.\nThe special courts will issue notices within 30 days of the petition against the tainted officers.\nTo fight corruption in government offices, Jharkhand has already formulated the Right to Services Act and the Electronic Delivery Services Act.\nIndia\u2019s nominee, Justice Dalveer Bhandari, a sitting judge of the Supreme Court, has been elected to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the first time an Indian has managed to get this key international post in over two decades.\nBhandari secured 122 votes in the United Nations General Assembly against 58 for his Filipino rival, Syed Akbaruddin, the spokesperson of the external affairs, said here.\nIn simultaneous elections Friday at the UN headquarters in New York, Bhandari also secured an absolute majority in the Security Council.\nIn the election to the ICJ, a primary judicial organ of the United Nations, commonly referred to as the World Court, Bhandari was locked in a fierce contest with Justice Florentino P. Feliciano of the Philippines.\nBhadari takes the place of Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh of Jordan who resigned from the Asia-Pacific region seat at the end of 2011.\nAn eminent legal luminary, Bhandari will serve the remainder of the term 2012-18. India was last represented at the ICJ more than two decades ago.\nThe 64-year-old Justice Bhandari has variegated experience in international law and is well-versed with the working of the UN. Bhandari has been on India\u2019s apex court since 2005 and has served in the higher Indian judiciary for over two decades. He will retire in September this year. He served as the chairperson of the Delhi Centre of the International Law Association for several years.\nBhandari is also a member of leading international academic and legal bodies and is closely associated with a large number of committees dealing with various aspects of international law such as: human rights, biotechnology, sustainable development, securities regulation, trade, nuclear weapons, non-proliferation and contemporary international law and space.\nAcknowledging his outstanding contribution, the Northwestern University School of Law, Chicago, US while celebrating its 150 Years (1859-2009) selected Bhandari as one of its 16 most illustrious and distinguished alumni.\nIn New Delhi, the Supreme Court Thursday had refused to quash Bhandari\u2019s nomination as a judge for the ICJ.\nEstablished in June 1945 by the charter of the United Nations, in The Hague, Netherlands, ICJ\u2019s role is to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorised United Nations organs and specialised agencies.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T04:38:44Z", "url": "http://biharprabhanews.blogspot.com/2012/04/bihar-news-latest-news-from-bihar-news_28.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "In western society, large-scale campaigns have been widely used to address social and environmental crises. In recent years, mass media and media convergence have produced within the realm of this phenomenon, a new interactive space in which publics are invited to participate and called upon as citizens. A significant corpus of academic research has studied these occasions through the themes of media rituals, celebrity diplomacy, global policy and \u201ccompassion fatigue\u201d. This research uses the 2005 Live 8 campaign as a case study combining perspectives on media events, Jacques Ellul\u2019s writings on propaganda and a rhetorical analysis in order to understand the techniques, which made Live 8 successful at mobilizing masses all around the world. The present study speaks to thought and action in relation to mobilization within a mediated environment for a global humanitarian crisis.

{"text": "This house replaced an old building that had suffered greatly over the years. It contains a number of highly efficient features in a relatively traditional package. Walls that are 12 inches thick with cellulose insulation produces a remarkably energy-efficient shell, for example.\nThe goal was to design a large house that still fit into the context of the \u201cvillage \u201c community. The varied roofs provided volume, while keeping the style harmonious with the rest of the neighborhood.\nWe designed the kitchen to include a breakfast nook \u201cbump out,\u201d allowing for lots of light in both the kitchen and eating area.\nSince the kitchen is the heart of the home, we expanded the space to include an informal sitting area and fireplace, as well as a connected screened-in porch. The open design creates specific areas that work together \u2014 and accentuates the kitchen as the center of social activity.\nA traditional, formal living room is located at the front of the house. The bay windows here are echoed in the breakfast nook.\nLocated in the heart of Munjoy Hill, this house was renovated from top to bottom and esentially reframed from the inside. The interior was opened up and reconfigured.\nThe original staircase had a beautiful curving design that was common when the house was built. However, the original floorplan hid the stairway and buried it into a dark hallway.\nThe fence marks the line between the public and private parts of the yard. It is also where the house transitions from the original exterior design to a more mordern look.\nThe major challenge of this building was its long, narrow shape. We carefully considered the creative placement of travel paths between the front and back of the house.\nThis is the entrance to the master bedroom, located at the rear of the second floor.\nThis house was completely renovated and updated with all new systems throughout, while maintaining the original character of the house. The entry and kitchen were opened up and expanded.\nThe kitchen and the entry to the house were opened up and expanded.\nThe new kitchen is flooded with lots of natural light.\nWe reconfigured the kitchen to create two large openings that connect it to the living space in the middle of the house. The result is a more open feeling and more natural light.\nThe challenge was to take a very plain, boxy two-unit apartment building and transform it into something visually interesting, while working within very specific spatial confines. The introduction of a \u201ctower\u201d helped to break up the ordinary lines of the building, without breaking zoning laws. The tower also houses a beautiful spiral staircase, which dramatically changed the interior as well.\nThere was only one balcony in the original plan, but now each unit has its own private balcony. Subtle angles and clean lines add a modern twist to the entire building.\nThe rooftop deck is an addition that offers views of Munjoy HIll and Cousins Island \u2014 and another space to entertain and socialize.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T02:33:29Z", "url": "http://prospectdesign.me/building_work.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Western Sahara is on the Atlantic coast of north-west Africa, between Morocco to the north and Mauritania to the south and east and Algeria to the north-east.\nThe area of Western Sahara is 266,000 sq km of which 180,000 sq km (68%) is occupied by Morocco and 86,000 sq km (32%) is controlled by SADR, the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic.\nIn the eighties Morocco divided the territory with a 1,800 km wall or berm made of sand, stone, landmines and barbed wire. The wall is watched over by radars, artillery, and air force, and is protected by 160,000 armed soldiers. Another 920 km of walls have been built inside the occupied area.\nWestern Sahara is rich in mineral resources, including phosphate mineral rock which Australia imports contrary to international law. Western Sahara has one of the best fishing grounds in the world. Currently its off-shore oil resources are being explored.\nMorocco invaded Western Sahara in 1975 when Spain abandoned its former colony. Mauritania seized part of the land, but soon made peace with the Polisario Front, the Saharawi people\u2019s political organisation, which continued the fight against Morocco.\nMany Saharawis fled the tanks and aerial bombardments of napalm and cluster bombs of the Moroccan invaders and set up refugee camps near Tindouf in south-west Algeria where more than 165,000 of them now live supported by the UN Food Program and other humanitarian aid.\nThose who remained in their homeland have constantly faced arrest, imprisonment, death and \u201cdisappearance\u201d at the hands of Moroccan occupying forces. Their escape is blocked by a 2,400km wall dividing Western Sahara into the coastal zone occupied by Morocco and the interior part held by the Polisario Front.\nIn 1975 the International Court of Justice held that Western Sahara was not terra nullius at the time of its colonisation by Spain and that neither Morocco nor Mauritania had sovereignty over it at that time.\nThe war between Morocco and the Polisario continued until an UN-African Union brokered a ceasefire in 1991.\nThe UN has arrangements in place for a referendum of self-determination of the Saharawi people but Morocco refused to allow the referendum to be held.\nWhile life is scarcely viable in the harsh Hamada desert where the refugees live, as there are no means for self sufficiency, the Saharawis living in occupied Western Sahara suffer the terrible oppression already noted.\nMINURSO was established to organise a referendum for self-determination of the Saharawi people in 1992 as part of peace process between Morocco and Polisario.\nBy 1996 the peace process was in stalemate.\nIn 1997, James Baker (George H. Bush\u2019s Secretary of State) became a UN envoy and drew up a new plan for the referendum, the Framework agreement on the Status of Western Sahara. Morocco refused to co-operate.\nIn 2003 Baker made a new plan, known as Baker Plan II \u2013 Peace plan for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. This was accepted by the UN and the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Morocco still refuses to allow UN sponsored referendum to take place.\nSince May 2005, there has been an increase in this oppression. Peaceful demonstrations have been brutally put down. Many Saharawis have been arrested and imprisoned. Some have been tortured and some have \u201cdisappeared\u201d. Women and children have been assaulted in their own homes and their property stolen by Moroccan police and soldiers. Outsiders, including parliamentarians from the European Union, Spain and Norway have been refused entry to Western Sahara. So have human rights bodies from Norway and elsewhere.\nThe Saharawis have their own democratically elected government, the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), with men and women ministers and parliamentarians. Its officials run the camps. SADR is recognised as the legitimate government of Western Sahara by at least 80 countries, most recently by the Republic of South Africa and Kenya. It is a member of the African Union.\nIn May 2005 in preparation for the full recovery of all of the Western Sahara territory SADR announced the commencement of a licensing initiative to enable international oil and gas companies to participate in the exploration of its offshore territory.\nThis licensing initiative is open to all competent and qualified companies and has been arranged in accordance with the UN legal opinion regarding commercial activities in Western Sahara.\nSADR believes that development of its significant natural resources will play an important part in developing a self-reliant, democratic and progressive nation in Western Sahara.\nThe present situation cannot continue. The oppression of the Saharawis in occupied Western Sahara must stop. The refugees in the camps must feel safe to return to their own country after the referendum to be ruled by a government that they elect directly.\nThe UN, the African Union, the European Union and nations individually must act to ensure that Morocco no longer precludes the referendum on self-determination for the Saharawi people from taking place.\nThe Saharawi people must be allowed to determine their own future through a free and fair UN sponsored referendum.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T14:33:22Z", "url": "http://awsa.org.au/background/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "These days, Harbour View Hospital is full of activity. But it wasn\u2019t always that way.\nIn early 2016, Harbour View \u2013 a long-term care and rehabilitation facility in Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia \u2013 came to the realization that change was needed to enhance quality of care.\nAt that time, it was felt that staff were working in silos and that interprofessional collaboration between staff could be improved.\nThe facility\u2019s diverse client population is served by an equally diverse multidisciplinary team that includes nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, recreation, social work, orthotics, hearing and speech, dietary, and others.\nBased on the perceived need to address problems with internal communication, Harbour View used funds from an innovation nursing grant to work on improving inter-professional collaboration on its rehabilitation unit.\nPart of the grant work included conducting a survey of all the clients in the rehab program. The survey asked clients what they felt could be improved at Harbour View.\nThe results were, in a word, surprising.\nResident Dennis Westin, centre, with niece Jen Boutilier and her partner Brittany Jones, enjoy some quality family time at Harbour View with their beloved pets.\n\u201cAll along, our focus had been on what we thought was an inter-professional role issue, so we were expecting feedback on that,\u201d says Angela Stairs, Director for Rehabilitation Services for the Nova Scotia Health Authority Eastern Zone.\nHowever, the overwhelming message was that clients wanted their families and loved ones to be more involved in their care.\n\u201cThe issue did end up being about communication \u2013 not between professions, but with clients and families,\u201d Angela explains. Families wanted more information on the day-to-day routine and treatment plans for their loved ones, and recommended that they be given more notice when clients were to be discharged. Clients and families alike also wanted flexible visiting hours.\nArmed with this information, one of Harbour View\u2019s first tasks was to do a full walk-about of the facility to identify areas for improvement in client-centred care. \u201cWe discovered right away that we had some challenges,\u201d says Lorna O\u2019Grady, manager of resident care for Harbour View site.\nThe building has a single entrance that splits off into two hallways: one leads to the long term care side of the facility, and the other to rehabilitation/restorative care. No signs were posted on the long term care side indicating what the visiting hours were, whereas the rehab side had signs posted at the building entrance saying that visitors were allowed in the rehab unit between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.\nIn March 2016, CFHI launched a pan-Canadian family presence e-collaborative initiative. The e-collaborative built on the work of the Better Together campaign and was designed to encourage organizations to examine and modify their family visiting policies.\nHarbour View began its participation in CFHI\u2019s 11-month e-collaborative in May 2016, along with 11 other sites from across Canada. Particularly valuable, according to Angela, were the regularly scheduled affinity calls that provided opportunities for all the organizations in the e-collaborative to share best practices and talk about solutions to common challenges.\nAlmost right away, Harbour View began to make some changes. They designed a new client and family information booklet and implemented revised visiting guidelines to include 24/7 visiting hours for families and loved ones. Education sessions and focus groups were delivered by former clients to give staff, families and clients an opportunity to ask questions and suggest improvements.\nAngela and Lorna admit that change is not always easy. There were some concerns expressed by clients, families and staff about issues such as privacy breaches and interruptions to treatment. \u201cSome worried that the floodgates would open and that families would be there all night, all day, potentially compromising the delivery of care,\u201d Angela explains.\nHowever, almost immediately it became clear that having family members present was helpful for everyone.

{"text": "Mahatmaji started another spiritual movement known as the temple entry movement and he wanted to give this facility to everyone irrespective caste distinction. The temple worship is another kind of spiritual cultural movement for the benefit of the ordinary class of people. He himself installed the deity of Sri Radha Krishna at Noakhali when he was there and that is also very significant. The theistic temples all over India are actually the different centres as are the churches and mosques all over the world.\nThese sacred centres were meant for diffusing spiritual education and by this process of spiritual culture the disturbed mind could be trained up in concentration for higher duties which every human being must do. By such education in practice can help man in realizing the existence of God without whose sanction, according to Mahatma Gandhi, \"not a blade of grass moves.\"\nA part of this movement is the harijana movement. The harijana means the God's man or the godly man as distinguished from the satanic devils. How a man of satanic principles can be turned in to a God's man is enunciated in the Bhagavad-gita. The way of karma-yoga i.e. doing everything for God's sake should be the principles of life.\nThe activities of the general public may not be stopped but may diverted in the manner stated in the Bhagavad-gita. By doing so any one in the world can be turned into a God's man. Thus the harijana movement started by Mahatma Gandhi should not be taken absolutely for the benefit of the bhangis and ___ so to say but it should be utilized for all who have the mentality of the bhangis etc.\nBy all the above process Mahatma Gandhi wanted to establish a greater human society. His idea of a casteless society could only be given a shape under the guidance of the principles of Bhagavad-gita. There are men of different mentalities according to quality and work. There are different modes of nature. These natural modes work everywhere in the world and different propensities develop by the psychological modes of nature.\nThe caste system is nothing but a classification of men according to such modes of nature. It is not therefore bound up within the walls of India but this is current all over the world may be under different names. This scientific and natural division of men should be accepted and people should be given chance to become harijana with equal facilities for all. The Bhagavad-gita gives a clear idea of doing this work and the Gandhi Memorial Fund should be utilized mainly for this purpose.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T10:21:46Z", "url": "http://www.letters.iskcontruth.com/2012/12/srila-prabhupada-letter-of-july-5-1949.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Should I stop seeing my councillor?\nHi Sam. I'm in a bit of a dilemma. So basically I'm going through a tough time , I'm especially worried about my Dad who suffers from a mental illness. I have my mum at home but I see a councillor at school and when I talk about things and my dad it makes me feel good to get it off my chest and tell someone how i feel. But the thing is she is a bit judgmental. She always focuses on how my Dad is feeling and not my feelings, and she talks about him, but she has never even met him so she doesn't really know much. Some of the things that she says make me feel like she is judging him and it makes me really uncomfortable. The school recommends that I go and see her regularly, and I do need someone to talk to but I don't think she is right for me. Do you have any advice?\nIt can be hard when we feel family members are being judged by anyone, especially someone who is meant to be helping us. Finding someone to talk to who can make us feel comfortable to share our issues with can really make a difference.\nCounselling sessions are for you to talk about the things that concern you and should not focus on others. Your feelings are important and should be the main focus of each session.\nSometimes it can be hard to connect with a counsellor and this may be one of those times. It is okay to tell her how you feel and give her a chance to repair the relationship between you. Most counsellors will openly accept this feedback and try to make things work for you.\nIf you find you still cannot work with her then try talking to the school about how you feel. You have the right to get things off your chest and to feel heard. Not getting on well with this counsellor doesn\u0092t mean you should stop counselling entirely.\nOne way that may make you feel comfortable is to talk to your doctor about counselling, as most surgeries have a counsellor for patients to use. Your doctor can refer you for talking therapy that is free on the NHS, although this will only be available if the doctor thinks it will help.\nOften talking to people of the same age can help. The ChildLine message boards have posts from people who are experiencing similar things. You may even want to discuss your feelings with a ChildLine counsellor.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T21:33:26Z", "url": "https://www.childline.org.uk/get-support/ask-sam/bullying-abuse-and-safety-asksam/should-i-stop-seeing-my-councillor/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "As we continue this series, beBATONROUGE chooses to share Raymond A. Jetson\u2019s \u201cWhat I\u2019m Reading\u201d interview. Jetson is the Chief Executive Catalyst of MetroMorphosis. In this role, he uses his extensive network and reservoir of social capital \u2013 as a former legislator, pastor and other executive roles in state agencies, to deploy resources to advance the strategies of the organization. Mr. Jetson is an experienced leader and an important \u201cconnector\u201d for intersectional collaboration between community members, stakeholders and systems.\nDuring the interview we discussed two of MetroMorphosis\u2018s initiatives, the Urban Congress for the African-American Male and the Urban Leadership Development Initiative. I\u2019ve provided a description of both initiatives for context. Urban Congress is a coalition created to understand the challenges that impact the quality of life for Black boys and men and then leverage the communities to transform their lives, their families, and surrounding neighborhoods. The Urban Leadership Development Initiative a year-long program teaches select individuals how to identify opportunities, develop innovative solutions, and build coalitions designed to foster positive, long-term change.\nFirst of all, if you don\u2019t know your history, then you don\u2019t know your future.\nI see you chose two books, \u201cThe Biography of Maynard Jackson\u201d by Robert Holmes and \u201cThe Practice of Adaptive Leadership\u201d by Alexander Grashow and Ronald Heifetz. Can you tell me a bit about the Maynard Jackson book?\nIt\u2019s about Maynard Jackson, the first African-American mayor of Atlanta, and he literally changed the trajectory of the city. He changed the economics of the city and African-American life in Atlanta. When faced with the airport building project that is now Hartsfield-Jackson airport, Jackson stood firm and insisted that there be equal distribution of the revenues associated with the project. Jackson insisted upon African-American business participation, along with African-American labor participation in every area of the world. Atlanta is now a city populated by African-Americans who have generational wealth, and that was in large part because of the leadership of Maynard Jackson.\nHow does this influence your life?\nIt helps me to understand that the right kind of leadership being practiced impacts others. You know, Maynard Jackson didn\u2019t get rich off the airport, but he was a catalyst and made things happen. The book also helps me to understand that real leadership is about that which lives on after you.\nThat airport will forever be Hartsfield-Jackson. Even though there are some who will not have a clue who the \u201cJackson\u201d is in that airport name, Maynard Jackson made a deposit in this Earth. There are young people, especially African-Americans, who will grow up in Atlanta and will inherit a generational wealth. They won\u2019t understand how the lives of their families changed. And so for me, it\u2019s about understanding the need for catalysts, and to sow into the lives of others. That\u2019s the critical ingredient in leadership.\nSo it seems that this book and your other book, \u201cThe Practice of Adaptive Leadership\u201d, overlap.\nYes, yes they do. This [\u201cThe Practice of Adaptive Leadership\u201d] is kind of the theory, the textbook. Maynard Jackson, in my opinion, is what it looks like. So as I read Mr. Holmes\u2019 biography of Maynard Jackson, I saw the principles of adaptive leadership being demonstrated in what Jackson was doing. In our work with Metromorphosis, we have the Urban Leadership Development Initiative\u2014where we have a group of urban leaders, and we spend a lot of time talking about the theory and \u201cThe Practice of Adaptive Leadership\u201d and \u201cMaynard Jackson\u201d is what it looks like.\nOkay. So you apply these principles to the Urban Leadership Development Initiative, and even to the Urban Congress on African-American males?\nI mean one of the goals of Urban Congress is to develop generational wealth and those things that are the result of catalytic actions. So these are just two pieces of literature that impact me in the same way, but with their very different reasons you do that.\nHow would you sell these books to others?\nFirst of all, if you don\u2019t know your history, then you don\u2019t know your future. Maynard Jackson is somebody that every African-American, especially those who espouse to make their community better, should take the time to read. Because here is a man who was the first African-American mayor in a southern city. That was a time of change.\nOne of my favorite people in the world, Marshall Ganz from the Kennedy School at Harvard, says that real leadership is about moving people forward in the face of uncertainty.\nMaynard Jackson stepped into a very uncertain time and was able to mobilize the city in spite of his opposition to deal with some real difficult challenges and \u201cThe Practice of Adaptive Leadership\u201d is about mobilizing others to attack on tough challenges and still thrive. Atlanta is a thriving city today because of Maynard Jackson.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T00:17:41Z", "url": "https://bebatonrouge.com/2019/04/10/what-im-reading-with-raymond-jetson/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Okonomiyaki is a casual, fun dish that's quite popular with foreign visitors to Japan. It's basically a savory pancake made with seafood, pork, cabbage and other vegetables, cooked on a flat grill and dressed with mayonnaise and tangy sauce. The \"okonomi\" part of the name means \"what you like,\" and customers can choose their own favorite ingredients to add to their pancakes. Many shops have customers cook their own okonomiyaki at the table.\nThis is a dish with very distinct regional variations. In Osaka-style okonomiyaki, all the component ingredients are mixed together in a bowl of batter, then spread out on the grill for cooking. The Hiroshima version is more complicated and takes longer to prepare, as the chef (not the customer) assembles distinct layers of toppings, vegetables, noodles, fried egg and pancake base into the final product.\nFinally, there's a version called monjayaki, which is similar to Osaka style but with a thinner, runnier batter. Monjayaki is generally found only in the Tokyo area, particularly in the Tokyo Bay neighborhood of Tsukishima, which is home to dozens of monjayaki restaurants clustered together in one small zone.\nIf you're in a cook-it-yourself shop, once you've decided on your main ingredient (e.g. pork, shrimp or squid) and your optional fillings, the waiter will turn on the grill at your table, brush on some oil, and deliver a bowl with the batter and ingredients. Mix these together and pour the mixture onto the grill (once it's hot enough), then use a spatula to turn over your pancake when it's ready.\nNote that this might take a bit longer than you would expect; ask your waiter for advice if you're not sure, or watch what other diners are doing. If there's an option for the waiter or chef to cook your okonomiyaki, you might want to take them up on their offer unless you're feeling adventurous.\nIf you're in a Hiroshima-style shop, the ordering process is a bit different - in addition to choosing ingredients like shrimp and squid, you'll generally have an option of either \"soba\" noodles (actually thin ramen-style wheat noodles) or thicker udon noodles. There may also be an option for no noodles at all. The chef will prepare your pancake and serve it on the grill in front of you. Cut the pancake into bite-size rectangles, and add extra sauce, mayonnaise and other condiments to taste as you eat.\nThe metal grill in an okonomiyaki restaurant is called a teppan, and menus will feature other foods prepared on the teppan grill, such as yakisoba (stir-fried ramen-style noodles with vegetables and sauce) and grilled seafood, vegetables and meat. Many shops have one large teppan grill with a counter surrounding it (a good place to watch the chefs in action), while others have separate grills at each table.\nOften okonomiyaki restaurants will also prepare items individually on the teppanyaki grill.\nPlease turn (up/down) the flame.\nPlease turn off the burner.\nDo you think this is done yet?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T00:40:41Z", "url": "https://www.bento.com/rf_ok.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "\ufeffI want you to bookmark this blog post and pull it out on another day when you need encouragement in public speaking and persistence, because it is a tale that will make your speaking troubles look small.\nKevin O'Neal of The Indianapolis Star reported a remarkable story today about special education teacher Mary French, who got to give her high school valedictorian speech...this week, 42 years after her graduation from Arkansas's Foreman High School. French, who is black, attended the all-black half of the high school until the two merged during her years there. But when she graduated in 1968 with the highest grade-point average in the school, it was determined that she hadn't attended for all four years--since some of them were spent in the segregated side of Foreman, across town. A white girl in her class gave the valedictory address instead.\nOver the years, French has returned to Foreman -- a town of about 1,100 just a few miles from where Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas come together -- and each time, she has felt disappointment when walking past a display honoring the school's valedictorians. French, now 60, shared her story with her colleagues at Fall Creek Valley Middle School, a Northeastside school where she has taught special education for 20 years. \"We heard that story, and our jaws hit the floor,\" Kathy Luessow, principal at Fall Creek Valley Middle School, said Wednesday. \"We asked how that could happen, and she said that was a different time.\"\nWe know this is only the beginning of a long journey. We understand as we go to college, we still will be confronted with obstacles that will certainly deter us. But remember, all things are possible if we believe....Let's travel. Let's start our own businesses. Let's become teachers. Let's become lawyers, doctors or whatever we desire. We should commend ourselves that we can be whatever we want to be.\nYou can read the valedictory speech she wrote, in full, here. Yes, the words read poignantly today, in light of the story--her \"all things are possible if we believe\" theme turned out to be true. But more than that, this is an excellent valediction, with simple but stirring language, a hopeful view of the future, a focus on students and teachers, and fitting, rather than overdone, rhetorical flourishes.\nIf someone knows of video out there of this late-in-coming valediction, please leave a link to it in the comments. I'm so delighted to share this wonderful story with you, and welcome your reactions. Please do pass this on to a friend or colleague and share this inspiring tale.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T04:11:49Z", "url": "http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2010/10/segregation-silenced-this-valedictorian.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Java might be the grandaddy of them all, but there are new kids on the block. Let's see what makes Scala and Kotlin great, frustrating, and how they compare to Java.\nSince the arrival and maturity of Kotlin, JVM-based languages face quite a challenge, most particularly Scala. You must have heard a lot about Kotlin by now, especially the perks and treats it brings to the Java table. But then there is Scala, a powerful and concise Java alternative. Scala vs Kotlin? Which one is better? Or maybe it's Kotlin vs. Java or Java vs. Scala?\nScala and Kotlin aim to better Java in their own different ways.\nTo those of you planning to shift from Java to either Kotlin or Scala (can't imagine it the other way around), I am going to paint a \"what's what\" scenario so you can decide better for yourself.\nLet's look at Kotlin first.\nKotlin was developed by JetBrains and reached the market in Feb. 2012 as an open source language. Up until now, Kotlin has had two released versions, with Kotlin 1.2 being the most stable version, released Nov. 28, 2017.\nThe language grew in popularity on Android because of its perfect compatibility with Java 6, which is mainly the present version of Java on Android. Not just that, Kotlin offers some features that are only in Java 8, and are thus not available to Android developers on Java 6.\nIn the closet full of 'All that is good about Kotlin,' the two most prominent qualities of Kotlin entail seamless and flawless interoperability with Java. You can call Java code from Kotlin and vice versa without any hiccups or frowns, not to mention the in-built null safety feature. Not seeing a NullPointerException is every Android programmer\u2019s dream.\nAndroid app development is completely transformed into a blissful, non-NPE experience. If you want some detail as to how the null safety works, check it out here.\nThat is also one of the 'why's' for Google adopting Kotlin on Android as an officially supported language.\nApart from that, take a look at some of the strengths Kotlin has to offer.\nAny Java competitor has to be an FP language. Kotlin lacks a little on the higher-kinded types and type safety, but nonetheless, it offers all the features of an OOP style language with an FP approach.\nThis is my favorite part. Java is great, but the boilerplate code it makes you write is just frustrating and error-prone. Coding in Kotlin is very short, concise, and to the point. Get the job done with fewer lines of code than in Java. The less you have to write, the less often you make errors and expose yourself to bugs. Everyone knows that, right?\nOne way Kotlin reduces the amount of code is by limiting the use of findViewById.\nKotlin allows views to be accessed from the layout XML, just like you would properties. Instead of using findViewById every time, all you have to do is follow this example.\nAlthough Kotlin is a younger language than Scala, it has the support of two great companies: the formidable Google and the amazing JetBrains, who are responsible for many other IDEs, including the IntelliJ IDE for Android. So there is no doubt about great tooling support there. To all the people who thought of Kotlin as some trend, you could not be more wrong.\nKotlin is already on Android and it is definitely here to stay, grow, and evolve.\nBut with strength comes some weakness as well.\nPattern matching is not strong in Kotlin. It doesn\u2019t fully support it.\n...that would be a no. But it's no frowner. You can still do a pretty fine pattern matching job by intelligently using the when clause. But we all know that intelligence takes a little more effort and skills than your average Joe.\nIf your applications are already long, then the extra runtime size of 800KB could be a problem for you. You might experience a dwindling number of downloads because of the bigger size of an application.\nNothing is ever all good. With the concise approach Kotlin offers, there is a little problem. With so much going on in so little code, it becomes a little hard to read and understand at first. It might even feel overwhelming to a beginner.\nAlthough Google has joined hands with JetBrains to offer support for Kotlin, it is pivotal to know that Google does not endorse it. Even when you use Kotlin in Android, the autocorrect occurs slower than it does for Java.\nAs I already mentioned, Kotlin is younger than Scala and, needless to say, Java.\nSince Kotlin is younger than Scala, it has fewer libraries, blog posts, and tutorials.\nThe online support community is quite small. The lack of blog posts, tutorials, and user documentation might become a problem for you, but as trends suggest, this might be filled up soon as more and more people and companies are adopting Kotlin.\nBefore you make up your mind, let's hop over to Scala.\nScala surfaced to the general public in the year 2004. Developed by Martin Odersky, Scala was released on the Java platform as a general-purpose programming language. The name Scala is not some whimsical notion, it is an abbreviation of \"scalable\": a language that is scalable according to the needs of its users.\nBeing released in 2004 sure gave Scala the advantage of maturing more over time and taking the spotlight from Kotlin.\nScala has some common features with Kotlin like conciseness of code, higher-order functions, FP functionality with an OOP style, and interoperability with Java (though not as good as Kotlin). Other than that, here is what Scala is about.\nPattern matching in Scala is no joke. Scala uses the match statement for this purpose, which is a powerful version of Java's switch statement. It allows you to match on any type of data, lists, and even your own types. If you haven't already tried it, I suggest you play around with it a little.\nScala is a little complex, but it has a very flexible code syntax. The proficient use of functional programming features makes the code extensible and hierarchical to the very best level.\nScala has been here for more than a decade. Since it is a powerful Java alternative, it has huge support community. We're talking about YouTube tutorials, blog posts, forums, and let's not forget the official support and user documentation. Anything you find yourself struggling with, you can pretty much find the answer to it.\nScala does not restrict you from overloading operators. You can play with operator-looking functions and define limitlessly. But you need to be careful with this feature. Still, if you can do this right, your code readability will increase. If not, you might end up making your code difficult to understand.\nEverything is about speed in the world of coding. A slow program is a big turn-off. When it comes to industry-grade projects, Scala's compile time turns into minutes as compared to Kotlin, which tries to compile as fast as Java, which is in seconds.\nScala is not binary compatible with a few versions. Let's say you compiled with Scala 2.1. The same will not compile with Scala 2.11.\nThat could be nothing, or it could be your biggest nightmare if you have to work across different versions and update them. Especially if you have production-scale projects.\nScala attempts a good take on managing null safety, but it's just not as effective. The Scala equivalent for null safety is the Option keyword. Using this, there is a considerable chance you might get an NPE at the back door.\nScala and Kotlin are in quite a tug of war. Scala has the edge over Kotlin in some ways, but Kotlin is just as formidable in others. The main differences \u2014 where the two languages set themselves apart \u2014 is that Kotlin is more like a better version of Java, while Scala is an entirely different kind of Java, so to speak.\nWhile Scala has a bit of a learning curve, it offers unparalleled support for advanced functional programming. Kotlin, on the other hand, is super easy to learn and fun to code in.\nBut does that mean something is wrong with Java? I mean why change from Java in the first place?\nJava is old. Really old. Like, great-grandpa old. And while popular, its popularity actually works against it. Java use is everywhere, which makes it impossible for teams using Java to change their fundamentals, even knowing that Java is facing a lot of technical criticism as well.\nNo matter the greatness, Java has too much redundancy and lengthy boilerplate code. Kotlin and Scala just happen to be better at what Java was intended for.\nChoosing the language primarily depends on the use you need it for. Scala is a good fit for projects with a need for a mix of functional and OOP style programming languages. For places where you need to handle large amounts of data or complex modeling reliant on mathematics, Scala would be best.\nHowever, if you just wanted Java to be less frustrating \u2014 but still be Java \u2014 then there is nothing better than Kotlin out there. Using Kotlin for Android app development will be the best thing that ever happened to you. Kotlin is like a Java cousin with better looks and who doesn\u2019t talk gibberish. So choose wisely and may the code-Force be with you.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T12:37:37Z", "url": "https://dzone.com/articles/kotlin-vs-scala-vs-java?fromrel=true", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

It said the herdsmen, who stormed the community, burnt down houses, destroyed crops and killed people. The church, therefore, urged the relevant authorities to stop the killings in the Benue valley.\nRev.Lorapuu said the Diocese had been active in providing food and relief materials to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP\u2019s) since the onset of hostilities in the state and wondered why it could be marked as a target of attacks. \u201cThe attack on the priests is an attack on everything that we ever stood for and believed in,\u201d says Lorapuu. Meanwhile, concerted efforts to get reaction from the Benue Police Command failed as its Public Relations Officer, ASP Moses Yamu, was not forthcoming with remarks. Rev. Fr. Gor had before the attack written on Facebook; \u201cLiving in fear. The fulani herdsmen are still around us in Mbalom. They refuse to go. They still go grazing around us. No weapons to defend ourselves\u201d. Herdsmen in the early hours of the morning attacked a Catholic Church and parishioners who went for 5.30 a.m. mass.

{"text": "Teaching Creation Thursday ~ Make a Fossilized Footprint!\nThis is taken from a lesson in the Investigating the Possibilities series by Master Books that will be on the market soon. It is in the Water and Weather book by Tom DeRosa and Carolyn Reeves.\nA fun activity to teach students more about how footprints, casts, and molds formed during the Great Flood.\nSmooth out about \u00bd to \u00be cup of playdough in a large paper plate. Use a roller or PVC pipe to roll over the clay until it covers the bottom of the plate. Now turn the clay over so the smooth side is up.\nRecruit a volunteer with a fairly small foot. Rub the student\u2019s foot with petroleum jelly. The student should carefully press his foot into the clay as if walking, and then clean the petroleum jelly and clay off his foot.\nTake some more clay (about \u00bd to \u00be cup) and roll it into a tube or \u201csnake\u201d that is about an inch in diameter and long enough to go around the clay in the paper plate. Place the tube around the edge of the clay and press it into the bottom piece of clay to make a seal. Squeeze and flatten the tube to make a wall around the footprint impression to make a bowl that can hold the liquid plaster.\nNow measure out 2 cups of Plaster of Paris into a disposable container. Measure 1 cup of water, and pour it slowly into the plaster, stirring and mixing continually. If the mixture is still dry, add more water a little at a time until it is like pudding. When mixed well, pour about half the plaster over the impression in the clay. Lift your plate with two hands a few cm high and let it plop down on the table. Do this a few more times. This will spread the plaster and bring air bubbles up to the surface.\nAllow the plaster to harden. It should harden in an hour or more. After it has hardened, carefully remove the plaster from the clay and observe the impression of the footprint. Look at the clay as well as the plaster.\n1. Describe the impression in the clay.\n2. Describe how the bottom of the Plaster of Paris looks.\nWhile your plaster is still wet, put some of it in a small meat tray. Rub the leaf with petroleum jelly. Quickly, but gently, place a leaf on top of the plaster and cover with plastic wrap. Use a block to gently press the leaf into the plaster. (Do not push down to bottom of the tray.) After it has thoroughly hardened, remove the leaf. Compare the leaf to the leaf mold.\nNot all fossils are remains of once-living plants and animals. Trace fossils are fossils where nothing is left except a footprint or an impression of where the organisms had been. The impression of the footprint in the clay represents this kind of fossil.\nSome fossils have been made by something like a stem with flowers, or leaves, or maybe a shell that left their impression in wet sediment. If something is pressed into wet sediment and becomes a fossil, the impression left behind is called a mold. If part of the actual organism gets trapped in the sediment or a new layer of sediment fills in the mold and hardens, that is known as the cast.\nThe vast majority of fossils are organisms without a backbone that once lived in an ocean. These include trilobites, crinoids, ammonites, and corals. Within this group, the most commonly found fossils are casts and molds of animals with hard shells, such as clams and brachiopods.\nYou might think that a few footprints wouldn\u2019t leave much information, but it actually tells paleontologists a lot more than you would think--things like the kind of animal that made the print, how heavy it was, if it was limping, or if it was running or walking.\nThe animal\u2019s weight can be estimated by comparing the depth of the footprint made with other footprints. The more the animal weighs the deeper the print. A lighter-weight animal will make a more shallow print. The distance between footprints is another important clue as to how large the animal was. Large animals take bigger steps than smaller animals.\nPaleontologists can often make a positive identification of an animal based just on the footprint. Sometimes a footprint cannot be positively identified, but can still be put into a category of the type of animal. Dinosaurs, for example, might be classified as theropods (certain dinosaurs that stand on 2 feet) or sauropods (large dinosaurs that stand on 4 feet).\nFootprints are only preserved under special conditions that occur before the prints can be eroded or washed away. Because these conditions must occur quickly after the prints have been made, it\u2019s surprising that actually billions of footprints have been preserved in rocks.\nGrand Canyon were laid down rapidly as a result of a catastrophic worldwide flood.\nwater, but often preferred to walk across the bottom of a tank of water in sand.\nhave been produced underwater rather than in desert conditions.\nThis is a part of a lesson about on how fossil footprints and other molds and casts can form. These kinds of fossils are very common, but they only form in rocks under rare conditions. The conditions that were present during and after the Genesis Flood would have been just right for forming fossils. Unless the prints were quickly covered up by new layers of sediment, they would have been washed away or eroded. The Flood would have provided many other ideal conditions for forming fossils.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T15:08:30Z", "url": "http://www.creationconversations.com/profiles/blogs/teaching-creation-thursday-make-a-fossilized-footprint", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Roger Federer of Switzerland and Bill Gates shake hands at the Match For Africa 4 exhibition match at KeyArena on April 29, 2017 in Seattle, Washington.\nWhen I was in my 20s and early 30s, my whole life was focused on work. I didn\u2019t take vacations or weekends off. I was always the first in the office and the last to leave. These days, I\u2019m better at balancing the work that I love to do with my foundation and taking time off to spend with family and friends.\nMy parents first taught me bridge, but I really started to enjoy it after playing with Warren Buffett. It takes a mix of strategy and teamwork to do well. We always find time to play a few games when we\u2019re together.\nThis civilization-building board game is a favorite in my family. Melinda, our kids, and I have spent many hours sitting around the table trading resources, building roads, and strategizing to be the first to reach 10 victory points.\nI have played tennis my whole life. This year, I got to play a match with Roger Federer to help raise money for his foundation. I wouldn\u2019t say it was the most relaxing tennis game I\u2019ve ever played, but it was a whole lot of fun.\nIt may not be too surprising that one of my favorite ways to relax is to keep learning. On average, I try to read a book a week, and I always bring a whole tote bag of them on vacation.\nIn 1993, Melinda and I visited Tanzania, Kenya, and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). That trip changed our lives and inspired us to start our foundation and get involved in philanthropy sooner than we planned. I know it\u2019s not possible for everyone to travel halfway around the world, so I\u2019ve started sharing VR videos on my Gates Notes blog of what I\u2019m seeing and learning.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T11:52:07Z", "url": "http://time.com/5066309/bill-gates-favorite-hobbies-relaxing/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "1. Why choose shutters? Shutters bring style & sophistication to any window & are equally at home in both traditional & modern interiors. They last longer than curtains, as fabrics begin to break down as soon as they are exposed to sunlight, require periodic washing & harbour dust mites. Shutters offer a level of light control unmatched by any blind, as the louvres within each panel can be independently adjusted to temper the degree of light entering the room. If the sun is in your eye, you can simply close the louvres on one panel & let the light flood into the room though the others. On dark days, the panels can be folded back to expose the window & maximise the light.\n2. Why choose Made for Shade? We're the Midlands' longest established, most trusted shutter company & have been fitting shutters since 1999, so we know shutters inside out. Experience has taught us that clients generally want three things - the best product, at the best price, with the best service. (John Ruskin famously said that this combination was not achievable & that one of the three had to give - We prove otherwise!). Additionally, for your added peace of mind, we're full members of the Guild of Master Craftsmen (membership number A121256) - your guarantee of a top-quality product & installation.\n3. How does the quality of your shutters compare to that of your competitors? Our shutters are manufactured by the world-leader in shutter production, utilising a combination of state of the art manufacturing & hand-crafted finishing touches. The wood used for our hardwood shutters is stored for six months before kiln drying to allow the wood to settle before being treated. UNLIKE the majority of shutter manufacturers our wood is kiln dried twice in a computer controlled drying facility. The wood is specifically dried to take into account the climate of the country to which the shutters will be exported. This is very important as these shutters are manufactured for installation in climates as varied as Alaska & Australia. By utilising these methods, frame warping is greatly reduced. UNLIKE many other manufacturers we engineer our stiles (the vertical, side bars of the shutter panels), rather than producing these as solid profiles. We cut the wood into strips which are then bonded back together in opposing layers for greater strength. This has the effect of breaking the capillaries that run through the wood, through which moisture travels. This, together with the strength of the bonding agent, ensures our panels are unlikely to warp & will give customers years of enjoyment. UNLIKE many other manufacturers we use mortise & tenon joints between the cross rails and the side stiles. These are far stronger than dowel joints & minimise movement between profiles. Movement can result in cracking of the paint or stain finish, which will spoil the aesthetic appearance of the shutters. Again, just in case there is some movement, we engineer the panels with an additional grooved overlap that ensures any movement is handled by this expansion joint. UNLIKE many other manufacturers, we use a high quality, proprietary paint system developed specifically for our shutters. Cheaper shutters use cheaper paints & stains and have fewer coats. We apply six coats of paint or stain, the final layer of which is a clear lacquer with a UV additive to ensure that the shutters are less susceptible to fading and yellowing. UNLIKE other manufacturers we don't compromise on the thickness of our louvres as we believe thinner louvres, although less costly to produce, are much more susceptible to warping. UNLIKE other manufacturers, we use the best quality, marine-grade stainless steel staples to attach our tilt rods to our shutters. In addition, the tips of the staples are coated in a bonding agent to make sure they remain secure for years to come. UNLIKE many other manufacturers, we supply our shutters with a large choice of frames rather than attaching them to battens. Not only does this give you the choice of framing your window by selecting a frame design to co-ordinate with your decor, but it also offers a practical solution for awkward windows (inward opening, etc). UNLIKE many other manufacturers, we assemble our shutters prior to shipping to ensure that all the components fit together perfectly. Once photographed, the shutters are disassembled & packed into custom made packaging to ensure they arrive in perfect condition. When shipping by airfreight, we double pack the shutters for additional security. All this means we are able to provide a three-year warranty on all shutters built within our published specifications. There are inferior quality shutters available on the market, but why would you pay more to get less?\n4. Which areas do you cover? We're based in Sutton Coldfield & cover the West Midlands, East Midlands, Staffordshire, Warwickshire & Herefordshire regions. We also cover the 'M1 corridor' (the area between the M1 & the M40 between London & Birmingham).\n5. Do you actually make the shutters? Like 99% of UK shutter companies, the answer is 'no'. Made for Shade is the Midlands agent for our manufacturer S:Craft (based near Winchester), who are the shutter market leaders in terms of quality, choice & product innovation. Our expertise is in designing, surveying, specifying & installing shutters, not making them. This enables us to offer a far greater choice of materials, colours, louvre widths & framing options & guarantees clients a constant timeframe from ordering to installation. That said, we have joinery workshop facilities for customising special shutters & have been regular visitors to the factory where the shutters are manufactured. This means we can talk in detail about the production process & answer any questions you may have.\n6. Who will measure & fit my shutters? Made for Shade is a family business & as such, we don't employ sales people or believe in pressure selling. We operate a he / she who surveys also fits policy whenever possible, to maintain continuity throughout the order process. Acurate dimensions will be taken at the time of the design consultation to save disturbing you further. Our aim is to make the process of buying shutters a pleasure from start to finish & our testimonials certainly bare this out as you may have already seen.\n7. How long do I have to wait? Standard delivery time is between six & eight weeks. Special shapes take an additional two weeks, as CAD drawings need to be created & signed off before manufacture can commence. Custom coloured shutters also take an additional two weeks. However, if you need your shutters fitted sooner, we also offer an express service, which reduces the waiting time to between three & four weeks, but naturally costs a little more.\n8. How long do they take to fit? This really depends upon the size & quantity of the shutters & what they're being fitted to (wooden window frames are quicker to fit to than plastered reveals), however most jobs are completed within half a day. Naturally, we can give you an accurate time frame before you place your order.\n9. How are they fitted? All Made for Shade shutters are fitted using a three-sided or four-sided perimeter frame, from which the panels are then hinged. Frames can be fitted inside the recess, outside the recess or around the front edge of the recess, depending on how & where you want your panels to fold when open. Needless to say, there are different frame profiles for every eventuality. (The latter option is perfect for uneven recesses, as the run-out is hidden behind the frame moulding). Whichever framing option you choose, all screw-heads will be either hidden with insert strips or cap covers & in the case of stained finishes, screws will be fitted using brass or silver mounting cups. For wider installations such as patio doors & room dividers, tracking systems are used as they give constant support to the panels as they move. All panels are fitted within their frames using hinges with removable pins, which are perfect when it comes to decorating, as the panels can be simply removed & re-fitted in a matter of minutes.\n10. How & when do I pay? Payment is made in two parts, 50% when the order is placed & the remaining 50% on completion of installation. Payment can be made by cash, cheque, debit card or credit card (all major cards accepted).\n11. What are shutters made from? Made for Shade offer seven different shutter materials. The most economical option is Craftwood, which is a Polymer coated MDF product available in the six best selling white / cream shades & comes in a choice of four louvre widths. It's perfect for small to average sized installations & looked just like a wooden, painted shutter when fitted. We then have a variety of real timbers including Larchwood, Basswood & Cedarwood, each of which have their own unique grain patterns & characteristics. Using lighter weight timbers allows us to hinge more panels together to achieve greater widths with a single, conventional bi-folding shutter. Real timbers can have painted or stained finishes, but our Western Red Cedarwood can also be oiled to give it a beautifully natural finish, which brings out the individually different grain structure in each profile to give a truly rustic charm.\n12. How much light do they cut out? There are no technical figures to quote here but we estimate that a shutter will cut out 90 - 95% of incoming light. Whilst there are no gaps to let in direct light, there will always be light glow around the edges of the panels, between the louvres & between the louvre edges where they meet the stile uprights. If actual blackout is required for bedrooms, we have the perfect solution whereby a cellular pleated blackout blind is built into the shutter frame & positioned behind the panels. The blind is raised / lowered by a simple cord mechanism & cannot be seen through the panels. The blinds are available in several, equally effective colours, the most popular being white.\n13. Can they be fitted to any window? It's a rare day when we come across a window to which we can't fit shutters, but \"never say never\" as the saying goes. We need to ensure that the shutter will not inhibit the opening operation of the window & that we have suitably substantial fixing points to bare the weight, but this is all taken care of during the survey.\n14. What if my window is out of square? This is usually no problem as most windows vary in width & height across the window. If you want your shutters fitted inside the recess, the tolerance gap between the outside edge of the shutter frame & the recess itself, will usually be filled with decorating caulk as this can be painted to match the walls or window frame when dry. It takes approximately half an hour to caulk an average sizes shutter to a high standard, but makes all the difference in the world to the final result. If the window it drastically out of square, we would fill the gaps by scribing insert strips (finished in the same colour as the shutters) to the desired shape & then caulking around them as described earlier. Alternatively, we have framing options which can either be surface mounted outside the recess or fitted to the front edge of the recess with a lip feature that disguises / hides the recess variance. It's simply a case of using the right frame for the right job, which is where our expertise comes into play.\n15. What about shaped windows? No problem. We design & fit round shutters, arched shutters & angled shutters in various materials with either painted or stained finishes. The great thing about shaped shutters is that unlike blinds or curtains, they maintain the true shape of the window rather than \"squaring it off\" & the panels will still hinge open to give access to the window.\n16. What about high-level windows? If shutters are fitted to an out-of-reach window, the tilting of the louvers can be done by remote control (both battery & solar powered units are available). Alternatively, if the shutter is simply to dress the window, the louvers can be simply set in the desired position & left.\n17. How do I clean them? The easiest way is with either a feather duster or using a vacuum upholstery brush (the one with the bristles on). Marks can be removed using a damp cloth with, if necessary, a suitable soap solution.\n18. What if they get damaged? We offer a full repair service whereby, for example, damaged louvers can simply be removed & replaced with new ones.\n19. Does fitting make a mess? This depends on what we're fitting to as drilling into plaster / brick creates dust which drilling into wood doesn't. Whatever the case, we will always dust sheet the fitting area first & clean up thoroughly when we've finished. Installers also wear slippers in carpeted rooms. We are always mindful that we are in your home. We therefore treat your home as we would our own, with respect.\n20. What's the most popular colour? About 75% of our orders are for a white painted finished & there are good reasons for this. (1) White reflects light in a way no other colour will. This means light within the room is maximised as it reflects off the louvres (tip ~ using the medium 64mm or larger 89mm wide louvres also creates more light as the gaps between each louvre increase with louvre size & larger louvre surfaces reflect more light. Food for thought if you have a North facing room with a big tree outside!) (2) White never dates & always looks fresh. (3) White offers endless colour possibilities when it's time to decorate, as white will work with any colour. (4) White will always be relevant as there will always be something else white in the room (window frames, doors, radiators, coving, ceilings, etc). (5) Shutters are an investment in your home & will appeal to prospective, aspirational home buyers if you decide to move on. Buyers can always visualise working their design schemes around white shutters, as it gives them an open book decoratively speaking in addition to the wow factor.\n21. Are they guaranteed? Absolutely! All Made for Shade shutters are guarantee for a minimum of 3 years. This includes all aspect of the shutters (colour fastness & joinery) as well as the installation itself.\n22. Are they suitable for bathrooms & swimming pool areas? This really depends on the level of moisture within the air. In a large, well-ventilated bathroom with no shower, a conventional painted or stain finished shutter will be fine. However, in high moisture rooms such as shower rooms, wet-rooms & swimming pools, we have a purpose made waterproof product called Permawood, which an ABS coated hardwood. Permawood shutters are fitted with marine-grade stainless steel hinges to resist moisture & prevent rusting.\n23. How do I measure? To obtain an initial estimate, firstly decide whether you want your shutters to be fitted inside of outside the recess. Remember if they're fitted inside the recess, the panels will only fold back as far as the recess returns will allow (usually 90 degrees). If they're fitted outside the recess, the panels will fold back onto the walls (provided there is sufficient space for them to do so of course). For inside recess shutters, measure the width & drop in 3 places & tell us the largest dimension in each case. For outside recess shutters, take the same measurements & add 150mm to the recess width to allow for the overlap. If your window has a sill, add 75mm to the recess height or 150mm if it doesn't have a sill, to allow for the overlap. If you're looking to buy Caf\u00e9 Style shutters (to cover the lower part of the window only), take the width dimension in the same way, but then measure from the sill up to where you'd like the top of the shutters to be. For inside recess shutters or outside recess shutters where the window has a sill, that's the height you need to give. For outside recess, Caf\u00e9 Style shutters where the window has no sill, add 75mm to the recorded height. Naturally, we will take accurate dimensions at the point of survey but following this procedure will ensure there are no nasty surprises price-wise!\n24. What are \"Solid\" shutters? These are simply shutters, which have solid panels rather than louvred panels. They were originally fitted into period homes, folding back into purpose made side-recesses when the owners were in residence. When the owners were overseas, the shutters were closed for privacy & security as part of the \"closing up\" of the house. These days, we tend to only install solid shutters when either a greater degree of darkness is required or when replacing original solid shutters in period properties. Naturally, the amount of light entering the room can't be adjusted in the way it can with louvred shutters.\n25. Can I measure & fit my own shutters? Yes. We can measure & fit your shutters for you, we can measure but you can fit or you can measure & fit yourself. It really comes down to the complexity of the particular job & the surface to which the shutters will be fixed. If you're self-measuring, we suggest you e-mail a photograph of the window prior to finalising your order so we can try to spot any potential problems & help you overcome them.\n26. Do operate a 'price promise' pledge? Whilst our aim is to provide shutters at the most competitive price & we constantly monitor the market to check price levels, there may be times when, due to a limited or special promotion, a competitor's price is lower. In such an eventuality, we guarantee to price match any like-for-like, written quotation.\nIf you have a question other than those above, please either call us on 0121-352-0747 or e-mail it to us via our contact page & we'll answer your question by return.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T04:51:19Z", "url": "https://www.madeforshade.co.uk/faqs/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Reasons why You Ought To Compare Online Fax Services No matter the type of product or services you are in need of, it is usually important to make a comparison before you buy any. This is also true when it comes to online faxing. Before you decide to use any online fax services, you should, make your comparison. It is advisable to compare as these services will require to be paid for every month. Any person or company that is planning to use the online faxing services will benefit if they compare the different providers. This is because in most cases, there is always a slight difference in the rates and plans offered by the online fax service providers. It is therefore important to do examine closely the different services that they each offer. Selecting the right online fax provider would benefit any company for a long period of time. Many people mainly consider the prices that the providers charge per month. It is not only the affordable services that you should put your interest on but also the quality of services provided. You should focus mainly on the quality of service you will be offered. The good news is that some online fax providers will offer you some free days for trial. This gives their customers an opportunity to determine whether the services are what they expected or not.\nOnline fax involves using the mail and web system to check and send faxes. Following the fact that everything is done online, you will not need to have a fax machine and even a fax phone line. You won\u2019t also experience the situation of messy inks all over your working place as everything will be paperless.\nThere are several reasons as to why online faxing have become widely known. First, it has been prove to very cheap compared to other means of faxing. It is also safe enough and portable. Additionally mobile phones and laptops can stand for the fax machine making it so convenient. For business owners, customers will be able to reach your business easily as the faxes will be available all the time. You must first sign up with an fax provider before you start using the online services. It is through the accounts that you will be given that you will be able to send and receive faxes. Beginners should use the various online comparison sites available in the in the internet. It is in such sites that you will be able to access the necessary information regarding the most suitable fax service for you.

{"text": "Traditionally, quantum theory has been viewed as a \"difficult\" topic, mainly because of the symbolic-mathematical content. For example, Francl notes that two semesters of calculus is usually required for physical chemistry (1), and this is certainly true for quantum theory. The traditional approach emphases the use of mathematical equations, derivations and calculations. How do we deal with non-chemistry majors who have a weak background in mathematics, but wish to study p-chem? Similarly, how do we deal with chemistry majors who have a weak background in mathematics?\nInterestingly, the last 20-30 years has witnessed a paradigm shift in the practice of quantum chemistry. Leading up to the 1970s, quantum chemistry was monopolized by theoretical chemists, who were as much mathematicians as chemists. One had to be conversant with the mathematical methodology in order to perform a quantum calculation. More recently, the amazing increases in computing power have lead to graphical user interfaces, which has enabled a new group ofcomputational chemists. These computational chemists are interested only in the significance of the computed results, not in the details of the mathematical methods used. However, the same paradigm shift in the teaching of quantum chemistry has not occurred yet: students are still required to be competent mathematicians.\nThe \"new calculus\" in mathematics education (eg, 2) advocates the \"rule of four\" (numerical, graphical, symbolic and verbal descriptions) to deepen students' conceptual understanding (eg, 3). This \"new calculus\" acknowledges that a predominantly symbolic approach to mathematics is suitable for some, but not all, students. The greater emphasis on graphical and verbal descriptions of a \"problem\" enables students to focus on the qualitative results. The numerical approach can refer either to approximate numerical solutions (cf modern computational chemistry software) or to specific numerical examples of more general symbolic equations.\nThis paper describes the use of spreadsheets to generate approximate numerical solutions and visual (graphical) descriptions as a method of avoiding or minimizing symbolic manipulations, mathematical derivations and numerical computation. The aim here is to teach the qualitative results that arise from quantum theory, but with less \"math\". The specific example of the one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation and some aspects of the educational pedagogy of spreadsheet usage are discussed.\nElectrons (and atoms?) exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.\nStudents are usually first introduced to quantum theory through the wavefunctions for the 1-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Exact solutions are derived for the particle-in-a-box (the Kuhn model (4)) and the simple harmonic oscillator model. The shapes of the potentials for these models are shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Potential functions for the particle-in-a-box model (left) and the simple harmonic oscillator model (right).\nwhere Hn(x) is the Hermite polynomial of order n. The novice learner sees the differences between Equation 1 and Equation 2 and concludes that every potential is treated as a special case!\nPotentials such has the triangular and stepped-valley models, shown in Figure 2, have no closed-form (ie analytic) wavefunction solutions. Similarly, the quantized energies cannot be given by any analytic equation. Here, the novice learner concludes incorrectly either that quantum mechanics does not apply, or that many systems are not quantized!\nFigure 2. Simple piecewise-continuous potential functions for which the wavefunction does not have any closed form: a triangular potential (left) and a stepped-valley potential (right).\nIn p-chem classes at Deakin University, the derivative is explained as the \"slope of a function\". The 2nd order differential Schr\u00f6dinger equation for an electron-in-a-box (the Kuhn model (4)) is explained as \"finding the slope of a slope\". The 1st order Euler method for generating numerical solutions is explained. No calculus is required as the Euler method can be derived from the definition of average slope. More-able students can construct an appropriate spreadsheet (to find numerical solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation), but mostly, spreadsheet quantum_well.xls<http://www.deakin.edu.au/~lim/KFLim/papers/2003_Spreadsheet_CCEN/quantum_well.xls>, implementing the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, is provided as a \"black box\" to weaker students. (The pros and cons of black box methods are discussed below.) Using the spreadsheet quantum_well.xls, students test how the shape of a trial \"wavefunction\" changes as the energy is varied (Figure 3). A copy of the instructions to students for this exercise can be found at<http://www.deakin.edu.au/~lim/KFLim/papers/2003_Spreadsheet_CCEN/Asgnt_1_6.pdf>. The wavefunction solutions are classed as \"valid\" or \"invalid\" depending on whether the boundary conditions are satisfied as energy is varied (the shooting method (6)).\nFigure 3. Approximate trial wavefunctions for the triangular potential (Figure 2), arranged from high energy (top) to low energy (bottom). Shaded domains are the forbidden region: V(x) < E.\nStudents discover that energy determines the wavelength of the wavefunction, and that valid solutions require that only special (\"allowed\") wavelengths will fit the dimension of the potential (Figure 3). It is observed that, as wavelength decreases, the number of nodes (the zeroes or roots of the wavefunction) increases with energy. An extension of this exercise using a skipping rope easily verifies that it is more difficult (higher energy) to swing the rope with nodes present than without any nodes (lower energy). Since the sign of the wavefunction changes across a node, the qualitative shape of the wavefunction can be generated from the nodal pattern. (One strategy in de Bono's Lateral Thinking (7) is to concentrate on what is not present - ie the nodes or zeroes - in order to obtain what should be present - the wavefunction.) Wavefunctions can then be generated from nodal patterns in 2-dimensions and 3-dimensions.\nFor example, the molecular orbitals for cyclopentadienyl have, in increasing order of energy, no nodes, one node and two nodes respectively (Figure 4). Similarly, the rotational wavefunctions can be generated by considering nodal patterns on the surface of a sphere. Much of Schr\u00f6dinger's original work was based on Hamilton's mathematical description of standing waves on a planet completely covered by ocean (ie water waves on a spherical surface). Note that these \"spherical waves\" correspond to combinations of the spherical harmonic functions, and can be obtained from the symmetry - \"topology\" - of the nodal patterns on the surface of a sphere.\nFigure 4. molecular orbitals for cyclopentadienyl. Shading of the circles in the centre panels represent the sign (direction) of the pz orbitals. The pzorbitals change sign across nodal planes, which are shown as blue lines.\nOn further exploration with the spreadsheet quantum_well.xls, students discover that the shapes of the allowed one-dimensional wavefunctions are similar (Figure 5), even for different potential models: ie, the lowest-energy wavefunctions all have one \"bump\", with no nodes.\nFigure 5. Lowest-energy approximate wavefunctions for the particle-in-a-box (top panel), simple harmonic oscillator (2nd panel), triangular (3rd panel) and stepped-valley (bottom panel) potentials of Figure 1 andFigure 2. Shaded domains are the forbidden region: V(x) < E.\nthe use of a series of square wells separated by barriers (extended Kronig-Penney model) illustrates that interactions between wells split energy levels. As the number of wells increases, the (single-well) energy splits into a quasi-continuous band of energies, giving rise to the band theory for conductors and semi-conductors.\nAlthough there has been a substantial history in the use of spreadsheet and graphical applications in education (eg 9,10), the author believes that full utilization of the technology, especially in chemical education, has not been realized.\nThe aim of this paper is to teach the qualitative results that arise from applying mathematics to physical and chemical systems, but without the mathematical rigor: \"teaching maths with minimal maths\". The \"new calculus\" advocates the \"rule of four\" (numerical, graphical, symbolic and verbal descriptions) to deepen students' conceptual understanding (2). Students who have a weak background in mathematics do not have the knowledge of calculus required for the usual symbolic algebra approach to physical chemistry. This case study illustrates how a combination of numerical, graphical and verbal descriptions can be used to overcome the lack of symbolic knowledge or ability.\nThe Logical-Mathematical intelligence is only one of multiple \"intelligences\" (11). By changing the emphasis away from mathematical calculus, the numerical-experimental activity, can also cater to those students who favor Spatial or Bodily-Kinesthetic intelligences. A combination of this spreadsheet approach with the traditional calculus-based approach will enable more students (and students of more types of \"intelligences\") to study quantum theory.\nThis paper has focused on the use of spreadsheets but, in principle, the simulations can be done using symbolic mathematical packages such as Mathematica, Maple or MathCAD. This would only be feasible for students who already have a strong mathematical background. This author prefers the use of spreadsheets for weaker students for the following reasons. The symbolic mathematical packages depend on the use of a symbolic, quasi-programming language, which can present an additional learning obstacle for many students (12). Furthermore, the access to symbolic mathematical packages is usually more limited than that of spreadsheets, which are widely available in home, business and community settings. The \"worldware\" (13,14) (also called \"application-software\" (15)) nature of spreadsheets means that students will have greater opportunities to use and become familiar with spreadsheets than with (eg) symbolic mathematical packages, leading to greater utility and expertise: Software that isn't designed for instruction can still be good for learning (13). (A \"straw poll\" of physical chemistry faculty suggests that significantly more faculty use spreadsheets in teaching and learning activities than symbolic mathematical packages (16).\nWhile weaker students will use the spreadsheets, discussed in this paper, as \"black boxes\", more able students can construct similar, appropriate spreadsheets (eg17-19). Instructors will need to be careful in deciding to use the \"black box\" approach or to require students construct their own. If successfully completed, the latter approach will promote deeper learning (19), but the greater complexity of the task (12) may mean that some students cannot complete the task, resulting in frustration and lack of learning.\nThe key feature of using spreadsheets is that students do \"numerical experiments\". (There is an interesting discussion of the use of numerical experiments in (20-22). Numerical experiments (eg 23) were also a key part of the development of chaos theory (20).) By playing with \"what-if\" scenarios, students can test the validity of their concepts and ideas: the success of using spreadsheets in this way is supported by cognitive constructivist models of learning (15,24,25). The use of spreadsheets is intended to give students a qualitative appreciation of quantum theory, and does not serve as a pre-requisite to more advanced studies in quantum theory, for which a reasonable knowledge of mathematics is required.\nThis paper is an expanded version of case studies to be published by LTSN Maths, Stats & OR Network <http://ltsn.mathstore.ac.uk/mathsteam> and by LTSN Physical Sciences <http://www.physsci.ltsn.ac.uk>.\nKFL thanks Ms Jeanne Lee ( ) (Australian Catholic University) for encouraging and helpful discussions, Dr Paul Yates<http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/ch/staff/pcy/pcy.html> (Keele University, UK) for suggestions to improve the spreadsheet quantum_well.xls, and Associate Professor (Emeritus) Ian Johnston <http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/johnston.html> (Uniserve\u00b7Science, University of Sydney, Australia) <http://www.usyd.edu.au/su/SCH/> for a seminar on MUPPET (the Maryland University Project in Physics and Educational Technology) <http://www.physics.umd.edu/rgroups/ripe/computer.html> which introduced KFL to the possibilities of numerical experiments in teaching and learning.\nAll URLs checked on 7 March 2003.\nFrancl, M., Survival Guide for Physical Chemistry; Physics Curriculum and Instruction: Lakeville (MN), 2001.\nPreparing for a New Calculus; Solow, A.

The 1966\u201367 diptych, from the \u201cCalifornia Dreaming\u201d series, is a portrait of the late art philanthropist and photographer Betty Freeman in front of her Los Angeles home.\nThe artist has had five other sales in excess of $5 million, all over the last 10 years.\nThis number appears to be somewhat of a sweet spot for Hockney, as none of those lots topped $5.5 million. The first sale at that price point came in 2006 at Sotheby\u2019s London, for the iconic 1966 swimming pool painting, The Splash.\nDavid Hockney, The Splash (1966).

{"text": "The Stroke Blog: We Want to Go with Oh to Paris!\nBefore we get started, did you miss our big announcement last Friday?\nParis is a city for the senses. And it takes our mantra eat, see, and do, to a whole new level. The tastes - melt-in-your-mouth baguettes and rich French wines. The smells - Parisian perfumeries and subways. The sights - panoramic views from the Eiffel Tower and Arc du Triomphe, shimmering stained glass at Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle, some of the best street fashion in the world. And countless things to do - burlesque shows at the Moulin Rouge, Seine river cruises, Parisian plages, Luxembourg Gardens, shopping the Champs d'Elysees, getting lost in the Louvre. In a lifetime you couldn't begin to scratch the surface of all this city has to offer. And that's why we love it.\n1. HEAR THE FOUNTAINS AT VERSAILLES. Yes, hear. You might think of Versailles as a feast for the eyes, but from April to October the fountains of Versailles come alive to the sound of classical music. We'll wander through the palace with throngs of fellow tourists, feed the ducks at the Hameau de la Reine, and ride a bike built for two around the gardens to enjoy the musical show. We'll have a lot of ground to cover - the gardens alone measure 8 square kilometers!\n2. PAY OUR RESPECTS AT P\u00c9RE LACHAISE CEMETERY. P\u00e9re Lachaise is Paris' biggest cemetery, and an art history student's dream. It's the final resting place of Chopin, Parisian architect Baron Haussmann, playwright Moli\u00e8re, Victor Hugo, musician Jim Morrison, Marcel Proust, Delacroix, the poet Guilliame Apollinaire, Oscar Wilde, Modigliani, and Gertrude Stein, to name a few. It's also home to many heartbreakingly beautiful sepulchres, funerary monuments, sculptures, and mausolea. Affectionately called la cit\u00e9 des morts (city of the dead) by locals, this cemetery feels anything but. And we can't wait to show it to you.\n3. PLAY AT DISNEYLAND PARIS. Conjure up an image of Paris and it may not include amusement park rides and Mickey Mouse. But we believe that even big kids need to play once in awhile. When we Go with Oh to Paris we'll experience the magic of Disneyland - Jess' first time to a Disney theme park. Spinning tea cups, costumed characters, Space Mountain, and Fantasyland. We'll see the world through a child's eyes, if only for a day. It's a small world, after all.\n4. DINE IN THE DARK. Although French food can arguably be appreciated with the eyes as much as the mouth, in Paris we'll opt for a quirky culinary experience and go dining in the dark. At other eat-in-the-dark restaurants diners and staff are given night goggles, but not here. Restaurant Dans Le Noir is the real deal. Diners and wait staff rely on their sense of smell and touch to navigate the restaurant and identify what's on their plate. We think it will make for a clumsy, messy, and fun evening. Imagine the before and after shots!\n5. SEE A WORKING GUILLOTINE. Formerly working, of course. In a tiny bar in Paris' Latin Quarter a bit of Parisian history is being preserved. La Caveau des Oubliettes (roughly translated as Cave of the Forgotten) is located in a genuine 12th century prison that held prisoners awaiting the guillotine. Serving up drinks in a simultaneously chilling and warm atmosphere, only at La Caveau can you sit next to a live jazz and blues band and a 1792 working guillotine at the same time. We'll drink up (pun intended) a little piece of Paris' history, and chat up some locals about what to see when we inevitably return to the city. Because Paris - this big, beautiful, sensory delight of a city - has a way of always drawing visitors back.\nHelp us Go with Oh to Paris! Send a tweet or email (they're pre-loaded with messages - easy!) or create a Facebook post to let Go with Oh know we're the best bloggers for the job. Not only do we have a great story to share, but Go with Oh wants to help you get the most out of what Europe has to offer. And we live that motto everyday.\nWith Go with Oh there's something for everyone. Get in on the fun! Tweet your best Berlin travel tips to @GowithOh for a chance to win a $50 Amazon gift card. You can also enter to win one of four fantastic travel prizes - Samsonite luggage, an iPad, a Panasonic camera, or \u20ac500 worth of holiday accomodation - on their Facebook site.\nWe've also created the #GowithOh tag on Pinterest! Head on over to check out our #GowithOh board for great travel ideas, and tweet us if we've missed your favourite.\nDine in the Dark, thats a new concept for me. Seems like the type of gimmickry you'd expect from the trendoids in Berlin, not the French.\nMaybe it would heighten my weaker than normal sense of smell. How about the French waiters? They might operate with more impunity as they're anonymous now. Did I tiptoe around enough lazy stereotypes already.\nI was curious about the waiters...I'll report back and let you know!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T10:43:56Z", "url": "http://www.mike-jess.com/2012/04/we-want-to-go-with-oh-to-paris.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Psoriasis, a chronic, recurrent inflammatory skin disorder. The most common type, called plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris), is characterized by slightly elevated reddish patches or papules (solid elevations) covered with silvery white scales. In most cases, the lesions tend to be symmetrically distributed on the elbows and knees, scalp, chest, and buttocks. The lesions may remain small and solitary or coalesce into large plaques that often form geometrical patterns with a central area of normal skin. In many cases the nails become thickened, irregularly laminated, and brittle. In addition to plaque psoriasis, there are four other types of psoriasis, including guttate, pustular, inverse (or flexular), and erythrodermic.\nPsoriasis is an immune-mediated (or autoimmune) disorder that occurs when immune cells known as T lymphocytes, or T cells, attack healthy skin cells in both the nonvascular horny outer layer of the skin and its deeper vascular layer. This attack causes the life span of the skin cells to shorten to about 3 to 5 days (skin cells normally live about 20 to 28 days) and forces the cells to reproduce more rapidly than normal. Psoriasis occurs in both sexes with equal frequency, being most prevalent between the ages of 10 and 30. It is most often seen in northern climates. An estimated 2 to 3 percent of the U.S. population is affected by psoriasis. In contrast, between 0.05 and 0.3 percent of Asians experience the condition. In European countries the incidence of psoriasis is highly variable, affecting anywhere from less than 1 percent to more than 6 percent of populations.\nThe onset of psoriasis is usually gradual but occasionally explosive. Precipitating factors may include injury to the skin, acute infection, and psychological upsets. Ordinarily, the lesions become less severe and sometimes disappear during the summer, possibly owing to the effect of sunlight. The severe complications of psoriasis are extensive sloughing of the outer layer of the skin, with resulting inflammation, and psoriatic arthritis. Generally, however, individuals with psoriasis are in relatively good health. The variability in the progression and severity of the disorder has led researchers to suspect that the underlying causes of psoriasis are the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.\nThere is no permanent cure for psoriasis, but there are a variety of treatments aimed at relieving the associated skin symptoms. Topical treatments for psoriasis come in different forms (e.g., creams and gels) and generally provide relief from inflammation and scaling. Some, such as retinoids (derivatives of vitamin A) and synthetic forms of vitamin D, work by slowing skin cell reproduction, whereas others, such as corticosteroids, coal-tar ointment, and salicylic acid, work by reducing inflammation. Psoriasis can also be treated with phototherapy, in which the skin is exposed to ultraviolet light. While phototherapy can be highly effective, it does have side effects, including pain, irregular pigmentation, and scarring. In addition, long-term treatments are associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.\nOral medications are available to treat psoriasis but are often used as a last resort, because the drugs that are most effective in treating psoriasis suppress the immune system, making patients susceptible to a multitude of infections and illnesses that can be life-threatening. Oral drugs that are used to reduce inflammation include methotrexate, cyclosporine, and azathioprine. Oral drugs called biologics (because they are made from human or animal proteins) modulate the immune system by attacking immune cells that are working improperly. Several biologics have been approved for psoriasis, including infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), and guselkumab (Tremfya).", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T22:36:43Z", "url": "https://www.britannica.com/science/psoriasis", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

They would approximate the disjunctions with the specific ingenuity of beings destined to evolve beyond good and bad, within the framework of the world allowed this side of Olympus. In the end it was about escaping the context, a sort of excusable inconsequence on the basis of the ideal of happiness, in the pursuit of which anything could be useful, even the reductions of sense.

The Price in which these homes are being listed has risen this month to $325,929 from January\u2019s price of $295,498. With the supply of homes still so low it\u2019s continuing to make it difficult for people to purchase a home in the Menifee area as well as other surrounding communities in the valley.\nNow taking a look at what is selling in Menifee, we haven\u2019t seen as many homes close escrow in January. We have dropped off 17 homes last month in comparison to December\u2019s numbers. The average price in which they are actually selling for has remained within $1000. The amount of time they are remaining on the market is maintaining its average.\nWith the debt relief act continuing until December 31, 2013 many homeowners are taking advantage of the benefits by doing a short sale instead of going through the foreclosure process. I have a lot of experience working with these types of situations and I know they can be a long process but if this is something you or someone you know is considering please call and I will be happy to answer any questions and get the ball rolling.

{"text": "Having seen 2016 revelation Kelvin Herrera melt under injury/ineffectiveness in logging a horrid 4.25 ERA, the Kansas City Royals were forced to look elsewhere during last season in order to find some stability at closer. They might have found a big solution in former failed-starter-turned-ace-reliever Mike Minor who was simply phenomenal in pitching to a 2.55 ERA and logging a closer-like 10.20 in relief. While it took the Royals until last September to hand the closer role to Minor, the lefty successfully nailed down all six attempts to give the team optimism there heading into the winter. Finally healthy after years of serious injury (including missing all of 2015 due to Tommy John), Minor appears to be just the latest example of a guy whose stuff translates better in the bullpen. Now that he was able to rely almost solely on his potent fastball as a reliever last season, Minor saw a big jump in velocity in going from just 91.7 in 2014 (his last previous stint in the majors), all the way up to 94.9 a year ago. Hence the major increase in strikeouts and the resulting three-year deal worth $28 million the Texas Rangers handed to Minor this past December. While Minor showed he can be an excellent reliever a year ago, the Rangers are going to first try him out as a starter in 2018 spring training. While Minor had some eye-opening success as a starter with the Atlanta Braves back in 2013 (13 wins, 3.21 ERA, 1.09 WHIP), that was many seasons/injuries ago. If Minor were trying to convert back to a starter in the National League, perhaps we would be more intrigued. As a result, only look here if Minor makes a push for saves in the Rangers bullpen at some point during the season.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T14:14:29Z", "url": "http://www.thefantasysportsboss.com/2017/12/2017-fantasy-baseball-hot-stove-signing.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Interviews of each woman's birth experience were transcribed and analyzed using Colaizzi's descriptive, phenomenological method.\nResults: The findings were clustered into five themes: preparing for childbirth, mistrust, feeling rushed, being fearful, and sacrificing.\nClinical implications: The results from this study contribute to the understanding of psychosocial stressors that are associated with childbirth complicated by unplanned cesarean birth. This study lends evidence to our practice by providing information about how important anticipatory guidance is for expectant women because the possibility of cesarean birth in today's environment is not remote.

{"text": "A first-summer male RED-FOOTED FALCON has been present north of Stoke-on-Trent (Staffs) since it was first identified on 9th July. It is favouring a horse paddock to the north of the entrance road to the former Chatterley Whitfield Colliery site just off of the roundabout on the A527 Biddulph Road at SJ 882 534 (SatNav ST6 8UW) and has been particularly confiding throughout its stay. Sadly, visiting photographers began artificially feeding the bird from about 12th (for photography reasons) which had the effect of making the bird almost 'hand tame', consequently attracting the wrong sort of 'admirer' and culminating in the attempted kidnap of the bird on 20 July. Despite the two perpetrators being identified and disturbed, they returned for a second attempt on 22nd. As a result of these illegal actions, it is now ESSENTIAL that no photographers attempt to entice the bird with food - no Crickets, no Locusts, NOTHING WHATSOEVER - and all visitors kindly adhere to the on-site instructions. Staffordshire Police were alerted and are now making regular patrols to the site, with Burslem's local police station offering a local Wildlife Liason Officer in attendance intermittently. Staffordshire birdwatchers are also on a rotational wardening system. Due to the nature of the perpetrators however, it is inadvisable for any birdwatcher to confront them but to telephone 0300 123 4455 immediately of a problem or 999 should they capture the bird.\nPeter Hines has very kindly supplied this superb video sequence of the bird - click here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyTWekc8vp8 - showing clearly how capable the bird is at finding natural food on site, of which there is ample.\nWe certainly do not wish to discourage birdwatchers from visiting, the bird being much better protected that you do - it is just that artificial feeding could prove detrimental to the bird's safety and survival. I visited the site on its second day (prior to any feeding) and as you can see from my array of shots below, it performs particularly admirably without any unnecessary encouragement.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T16:13:02Z", "url": "http://uk400clubrarebirdalert.blogspot.com/2015/07/a-particularly-confiding-red-footed.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Menstrual like cramps started Friday mid-morning, but I didn\u2019t think too much of it. By afternoon, I noticed they were still there and out of curiosity more than anything thought I\u2019d see if there was a pattern. There was! Extremely timeable, but very short and could barely feel them.\nAfter several hours of monitoring, nothing was picking up and I started to worry it was prodromal, but in my Hypnobabies birth visualizations that I had been doing I would go to sleep and get the real party started in the morning, so I kept faith, turned on my birthing day tracks and attempted to get some sleep\u2026 but I was way too excited though for that just in case! Morning brought nothing more though.\nSo instead, I headed into the chiro and just took it very very easy at home just in case and just enjoyed having such a calm and relaxing morning.\nAfter arriving, she agreed that it was hard to tell if we were still practicing or just in a very very early time. I convinced myself that maybe it just LOOKED that way because I was using my hypnosis, but the timings and lengths just weren\u2019t promising. After about an hour, I started to get real antsy and wanted to be downstairs. Out of nowhere I vomited. Ok! NOT in practice!!\nThings picked up beautifully from there. I could just sense that my waves were getting longer, but sensation wise, couldn\u2019t really tell in comparison thanks to my hypnosis. Each wave felt powerful and intense but never painful. I could tell I was hanging longer at the top of the waves but just let myself go to center (a Hypnobabies hypnosis technique), vocalize through it and reminded myself to smile at the end.\nI was very vocal through each wave which felt good and helped me direct my hypno-anesthesia. I couldn\u2019t stand having the headphones in so asked to put my Hypnobabies tracks on out loud on repeat, which was great. I easily went back and forth from center to off but kept in center the majority of the time.\nTime seemed to both linger, yet rush. My husband (now) has told me that I didn\u2019t sound comfortable, but I truly only felt slight discomfort and just very very strong pressure. My birthing day affirmations played loudly in my head reminding myself that each wave was easy, comfortable and bringing me one step closer to holding my baby.\nWe had beautiful progress of pushing for the next 45 minutes. Hubby kept my Hypnobabies \u201cpushing baby out\u201d track on repeat which SO helped me in the moments that I just wasn\u2019t sure if I could do it anymore. This was the only time that I felt more than pressure, but knew we were so close! Hearing that I was just stretching (that was honestly the hardest part for me, I could barely feel the waves at this point, but I felt the stretching!) or reminding me where to put my hypno-anesthesia kept bringing me back into the moment rather than letting my emotions take over. I never doubted my hypnosis here but was by all means wondering why my body wasn\u2019t stretching more and just desperately praying that it would!!\nAfter 45 minutes I knew I needed to change positions, they recommended the side lie which helped for a few pushes, but I\u2019d visualized birthing on my knees, so I knew I needed to make one final change and within one more push he was out!!!!\nI couldn\u2019t even catch him because I was already crying and then just in such shock/joy that they had to tell me to turn over to get him. There was a second-degree tear in the final moments (kiddo decided he wanted to wave at us all as he arrived) and it ended up they just believed I had a very very tight perineum, which is why the pushing was long but the Dr (there because of VBAC) kept praising my control through the whole thing.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T16:39:34Z", "url": "https://www.hypnobabies.com/leannas-hypnobabies-hospital-vbac-success/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "The 7th was spent in preparing my despatches for Adelaide. On the 8th I sent in a dray to Port Lincoln, with Mr. Scott\u2019s luggage, and those things that were to be sent to Adelaide, comprising all the specimens of geology and botany we had collected, a rough chart of our route, and the despatches and letters which I had written. The boat was not ready at the time appointed, and Mr. Scott returned to the tents. In the evening, however, he again went to the settlement, and about ten, P.M., he, and the man who was to manage the boat, went on board to sail for Adelaide. I had been taken very ill during the day, and was unable to accompany him to the place of embarkation. The following is a copy of my despatch to the Governor, and to the Chairman of the Northern Expedition Committee, embodying my reasons for going to the westward.\n\u201cSir, \u2014 Having fallen back upon Port Lincoln for supplies, an opportunity has occurred to me of writing a brief and hurried report of our proceedings. I have, therefore, the honour to acquaint you, for the information of His Excellency, the Governor, and the colonists interested in the Northern Expedition, with the result of my examination of the country north of Spencer\u2019s Gulf, and of the further steps I contemplate taking to endeavour to carry out the wishes of the Committee, and accomplish the object for which the expedition was fitted out.\n\u201cUpon leaving our depot, near Mount Arden, the low, arid, and sandy nature of the country between the hills and Lake Torrens, compelled us to follow close under the continuation of Flinders range. Here our progress was necessarily very slow, from the rugged nature of the country, the scarcity of water, and the great difficulty both of finding and obtaining access to it. As we advanced, the hills inclined considerably to the eastward, gradually becoming less elevated, until, in latitude 29 degrees 20 minutes S., they ceased altogether, and we found ourselves in a very low and level country, consisting of large stony plains, varied occasionally by sand; and the whole having evidently been subject to recent and extensive inundation. These plains are destitute of water, grass, and timber, and have only a few salsolaceous plants growing upon them; whilst their surface, whether stony or sandy, is quite smooth and even, as if washed so by the action of the water. Throughout this level tract of country were interspersed, in various directions, many small flat-topped elevations, varying in height from 50 to 300 feet, and almost invariably exhibiting precipitous banks. These elevations are composed almost wholly of a chalky substance, coated over on the upper surface by stones, or a sandy soil, and present the appearance of having formed a table land that has been washed to pieces by the violent action of water, and of which these fragments now only remain. Upon forcing a way through this dreary region, in three different directions, I found that the whole of the low country round the termination of Flinders range, was completely surrounded by Lake Torrens, which, commencing not far from the head of Spencer\u2019s Gulf, takes a circuitous course of fully 400 miles, of an apparent breadth of from twenty to thirty miles, following the sweep of Flinders range, and almost encircling it in the form of a horse shoe.\n\u201cThe greater part of the vast area contained in the bed of this immense lake, is certainly dry on the surface, and consists of a mixture of sand and mud, of so soft and yielding a character, as to render perfectly ineffective all attempts either to cross it, or reach the edge of the water, which appears to exist at a distance of some miles from the outer margin. On one occasion only was I able to taste of its waters; in a small arm of the lake near the most north-westerly part of it, which I visited, and here the water was as salt as the sea. The lake on its eastern and southern sides, is bounded by a high sandy ridge, with salsolae and some brushwood growing upon it, but without any other vegetation. The other shores presented, as far as I could judge, a very similar appearance; and when I ascended several of the heights in Flinders range \u2014 from which the views were very extensive, and the opposite shores of the lake seemed to be distinctly visible \u2014 no rise or hill of any kind could ever be perceived, either to the west, the north, on the east; the whole region around appeared to be one vast, low, and dreary waste. One very high and prominent summit in this range, I have named Mount Serle; it is situated in 30 degrees 30 minutes south latitude, and about 139 degrees 10 minutes east longitude, and is the first point from which I obtained a view of Lake Torrens to the eastward of Flinders range, and discovered that I was hemmed in on every side by a barrier it was impossible to pass. I had now no alternative left me, but to conduct my party back to Mount Arden, and then decide what steps I should adopt to carry out the objects of the expedition. It was evident, that to avoid Lake Torrens, and the low desert by which it is surrounded, I must go very far either to the east or to the west before again attempting to penetrate to the north.\n\u201cFirst \u2014 To move my party to the southward, to endeavour to procure supplies from the nearest stations north of Adelaide, and then, by crossing to the Darling, to trace that river up until I found high land leading to the north-west.\n\u201cSecondly \u2014 To cross over to Streaky Bay, send from thence to Port Lincoln for supplies, and then follow the line of coast to the westward, until I met with a tract of country practicable to the north. To the first of these plans were many objections; amongst the principal ones, were, the very unfavourable accounts given both by Captain Sturt, and Major Mitchell, of the country to the west of the Darling River \u2014 the fact of Captain Sturt\u2019s having found the waters of that river salt during a continued ride of many days \u2014 the numerous tribes of natives likely to be met with, and the very small party I should have with me; lastly, the course of the river itself, which trending so much to the eastward, would take us from, rather than towards the centre of this Continent. On the other hand, by crossing to the westward, I should have to encounter a country which I knew to be all but destitute of water, and to consist, for a very great distance, of barren sandy ridges and low lands, covered by an almost impenetrable scrub, at a season, too, when but little rain could be expected, and the heat would, in all probability, be intense; still, of the two, the latter appeared to me the least objectionable, as we should at least be going towards the point we wished to reach, and through a country as yet quite unknown.\n\u201cAfter mature and anxious consideration, therefore, I decided upon adopting it, hoping that my decision may meet with the approbation of the Committee.\n\u201cPrevious to our arrival at Mount Arden, we experienced very showery weather for some days, (otherwise we could not have attempted a passage to the westward); and as there were no longer any apprehensions of water being found on the route to Streaky Bay, I sent two of my teams across upon our old tracks, in charge of my overseer, whilst I conducted the third myself, in company with Mr. Scott, direct to Port Lincoln, to procure the supplies we required. In crossing from Mount Arden, towards Port Lincoln, we travelled generally through a low barren country, densely covered by brush, among which were scattered, at considerable intervals, a few small patches of grass, with here and there some rocky elevations; in the latter, we were usually able to procure water for ourselves and horses, until we arrived at the districts already explored, in traversing which we passed (to the N. E. of Port Lincoln) some rich, well watered valleys, bounded by a considerable extent of grassy hills, well adopted for sheep or cattle, arriving at Port Lincoln on the 3rd of October. As a line of route from Adelaide for the emigration of stock, the course we followed, though it cannot be called a good one, is perfectly practicable in the winter season; and I have no doubt, when the country becomes better known, the present track might be considerably improved upon, and both grass and water obtained in greater abundance.\n\u201cI regret extremely to acquaint you, that on the morning of the 9th September, one of the police horses (called \u201cGrey Paddy\u201d) kindly lent to the Expedition by His Excellency the Governor, was found with his leg broken, apparently from the kick of another horse during the night, and I was obliged to order him to be shot in consequence. With this exception, no serious accident has occurred, and the whole of the party are in the enjoyment of good health and spirits. As the Expedition will still be absent, in all probability, upwards of five months, I have availed myself of a kind offer from Dr. Harvey, to send his boat over to Adelaide, and have sent Mr. Scott to receive any instructions his Excellency the Governor, or the Committee, may wish to give relative to our future proceedings; and immediately Mr. S. returns, I shall hurry up to Streaky Bay with the supplies, and at once move on to the westward, my overseer being now engaged in preparing for our forcing a passage through the scrub, to the north-west of Streaky Bay, as soon as we arrive there with the remainder of the party.\nFrom the 9th to the 22nd of October, I was occupied a good deal at the camp, having only one man and a native boy to attend to the tent, the horses and the sheep, so that I was in a great measure confined at home, occasionally only making short excursions to the town to superintend the preparation of a large supply of horse-shoes, or visiting the stations of some of the nearest country settlers. I had lately bought a kangaroo dog, from the captain of an American whaler, and in these rambles had frequent opportunities of trying my new purchase, both after emus and kangaroos, but he was quite useless for hunting either, and did little credit to the honesty of the person who sold him to me, and who had asked and received a high price, in consideration of the animal being, as he assured me, of a better description than ordinary. Of the natives of the district I saw nothing whatever; the death of young Hawson, and the subsequent scouring of the country by police, had driven them away from the occupied parts, and forced them to the fastnesses of the hills, or to the scrubs; I was, however, enabled by the kindness of Mr. Schurman, a German Missionary, stationed at Port Lincoln, to obtain a limited collection of words and phrases in the dialect of the district, and which I hoped might be of some use to me hereafter. Mr. Schurman has since published a copious vocabulary and grammar, of the language in use in this part of Australia.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T16:16:08Z", "url": "http://australianexplorers.com.au/australian-explorers/edward-john-eyre/eyre-vol-1-ch-9/982-october-7?tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;layout=default", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Southeastern New England is covered by a narrow coastal plain, while the western and northern regions are dominated by the rolling hills and worn-down peaks of the northern end of the Appalachian Mountains.\nWith the Atlantic fall line lying so close to the coast, numerous industrial cities were able to take advantage of water power along the numerous rivers, such as the Connecticut River, which bisects the region from north to south.\nThe region is particularly known for its beautiful fall foliage. Take a look at the beautiful New England scenery in the video below.\nEach state is principally subdivided into small incorporated municipalities, which are known as towns. These are often governed by town meetings.

{"text": "More than 1 in 12 of Greensboro\u2019s renter households were subject to eviction judgments in 2016, one of the highest rates of any large U.S. city. The city\u2019s affordability challenges, though, are by no means unique. As seen in other places, stagnant incomes for poorer households haven\u2019t kept up with steadily escalating rents, contributing to high evictions in areas all across the country. To make matters worse, a tornado ripped through the city in April, displacing many residents.\nA recently launched Princeton University database compiled from 83 million court records dating back to 2000 provides the first-ever national look at evictions. The Eviction Lab project is led by Matthew Desmond, whose recent Pulitzer Prize-winning book Evicted sparked a national dialogue on the issue.\nWhat the Rise in Renting Means for Cities The Unintended Consequences of Smoke-Free Public Housing Newly Elected Democratic Socialists Bring New Ideas on Affordable Housing Can Paying for the Poor to Have Lawyers Actually Save a City Money? With Child Homelessness on the Rise, What Can Schools Do?\nData reveal that high rates of evictions aren\u2019t just confined to expensive housing markets or high-poverty cities. In Hampton, Va., for example, 1 in 10 renters faced a court-ordered eviction. And in Tulsa, Okla., and Killeen, Texas, the rate was 1 in 13. \u201cBefore these data, we really didn\u2019t know just how widespread evictions were,\u201d says Megan Hatch, who researches the issue at Cleveland State University.\nThe highest eviction rates were generally found in jurisdictions throughout the Southeast -- and not just in urban areas. Some rural and exurban places across the U.S. also experience elevated rates of eviction. Areas with high concentrations of African-Americans reported particularly high totals.\nBrett Byerly, who heads the Greensboro Housing Coalition, a group providing housing counseling and support services, says an estimated 80 percent of the organization\u2019s clients are black and most are women, mirroring disparities elsewhere. Governing\u2019s calculations of Eviction Lab\u2019s 2016 data for larger counties suggest eviction rates are strongly correlated with African-American populations, more so than poverty levels and rent burdens.\nNationally, Eviction Lab estimates suggest 2.3 percent of renters experienced a court-ordered eviction in 2016. But that\u2019s a significant undercount. More than twice as many evictions were filed that never led to a judgment. Other instances when tenants left after receiving notice or were paid to do so also aren\u2019t captured in court records. Desmond\u2019s research has found such informal evictions accounted for nearly half the total in Milwaukee.\nMost of the time, tenants threatened with eviction don\u2019t show up to court hearings. In Guilford County, where Greensboro is located, only about a quarter appeared in court, according to Sills\u2019 research. A big reason for this is that on top of potentially being evicted, Greensboro tenants appearing in court face the possibility of a cash judgment against them.\nAshley Gromis, an Eviction Lab researcher, says she was surprised to see many cases popping up in court systems with the same landlords and tenants at the same addresses. This suggests court filings are being used as a debt collection tool, with tenants likely repeatedly paying for a landlord\u2019s court fee on top of any late fees.\nLandlords further hold the upper hand in terms of legal representation. A 2004 study of Phoenix-area courts reported attorneys represented landlords in 87 percent of eviction cases, while not a single tenant had legal counsel. Some nonprofit groups provide free legal assistance, but there aren\u2019t enough of them. There\u2019s just one such legal aid firm serving Greensboro\u2019s low-income renters and the rest of the state.\nByerly of the Greensboro Housing Coalition says it\u2019s particularly difficult to find housing for those with an eviction on their record. That\u2019s because landlords are screening prospective tenants with third-party companies that collect court data. California expanded a state law a few years ago that seals many of these eviction cases from the general public to help protect renters.\nAs in a lot of cities, Greensboro\u2019s top evictor is the local public housing authority. Part of that\u2019s due to the population such authorities serve and their large housing inventory. Sills says public housing residents are also subject to more inspections and stricter rules than people in private developments. Many worry the problem could worsen with a new federal mandate prohibiting smoking inside public housing and outdoor areas within 25 feet of buildings.\nStates\u2019 landlord-tenant laws vary widely. Cleveland State\u2019s Hatch reviewed all policies around rules such as how many days\u2019 notice landlords must give before increasing rent or how long they have to wait before starting eviction proceedings for delinquent renters. Northeastern states, along with California and a few others, maintain the most pro-renter laws. North Carolina and other parts of the South and Midwest tended to favor landlords, according to Hatch\u2019s research.\nAt the local level, New York last year became the first city to guarantee all low-income residents threatened with eviction the right to legal counsel. Other cities are establishing legal aid funds. A Harvard Law Review study found that renters assigned legal representation were significantly more likely to retain their residences following litigation than those without an attorney.\nAnother approach that\u2019s gaining momentum is \u201cjust cause\u201d provisions. To evict a tenant, landlords must provide a reason specifically permitted by a local ordinance. The requirement could also help avoid, say, large-scale evictions when a new owner acquires an apartment building. Housing advocates also suggest preventing evictions makes financial sense for cities given the high cost of providing services to those without a place to live. Some are pursuing eviction diversion programs, such as a mediation service Denver recently piloted.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T12:03:48Z", "url": "https://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/gov-eviction-epidemic.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "From these definitions, you\u2019d assume that designing a website only encompasses pictures, text, and the layout of the pages of a website. Which technically is true. However, in today\u2019s world of search engine marketing (SEM), a pretty website is worthless if nobody finds it.\nYou need to do additional work to make the site optimized for ranking purposes and to drive traffic to it. Many make this a task to complete after the website design is complete. While that is certainly an option, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the best one.\nSlapping a website on the internet isn\u2019t enough for your online presence. You need to have the right keywords embedded into the site in order to start building your organic SEO. So why not do the required keyword research upfront during the design phase?\nWeb designers and SEO experts are sometimes at odds with their priorities. The goal of designers is to produce an aesthetically appealing site that communicates to visitors that they put great effort into the final product. SEO is not their priority. SEOs, however, tend to include code that is easily crawled, indexed, and understood by a search engine spider. It\u2019s focused on keywords but can be difficult to navigate and doesn\u2019t do a good job of lead conversion.\nSo what you need is a balancing act when it comes to creating a web design that is SEO-rich. Getting that result requires using a process to accomplish both goals (attractive and functional design AND keyword-rich optimization).\nBesides, even if the keyword stuffing did rank you higher and drive traffic to your site, do you really think that visitors would stay there long if they didn\u2019t find useful information?\nAn appropriate amount of time and effort should be allotted to keyword research. Choosing the right keywords for your business is crucial. Words or phrases that your target audience might include in queries to find your product or service need to be included in your web content strategically in a natural, relevant flow of content.\nWebsites need to be designed for use on multiple devices: laptops, tablets and mobile. Over 70% of internet searching is done via smart phones and that number will continue to grow. If your website isn\u2019t designed to be mobile-friendly, it will be penalized, not only by the search engines but by prospective customers. Google rewards mobile-friendly websites with higher organic SEO rankings. Users will not stay long if they can\u2019t navigate easily or see what they want on the site.\nIf you design the website from the get-go to automatically adjust for optimal display on all devices, you won\u2019t have to worry about it later on.\nThese are behind-the-scene items in the HTML code that can boost SEO for the website. Remember, great design is to help the people who make it to your site, but the code is to help the search engines get them there.\nThe header tags include an overall summary of the page for search engines to use for ranking without having to read the rest of the page content. Including keywords in the headers will further optimize the site and make the content more organized and easier to read and understand.\nA title tag is an HTML element that specifies the title of a web page. They are what appears in search results as a clickable link to the site. They should contain the primary keyword phrase, ideally at the beginning for best SEO results.\nSearch engines cannot scan images for keywords, so it\u2019s important to add a title for them and include alt text that incorporates keywords.\nNeed a Website that Will Get You Leads?\nIf you don\u2019t have a website at all, we can design you one that meets your specific business needs, includes SEO to get your ranked highly and will promote lead conversion. If you already have a website, let us run a complimentary SEO Report against it to show you how it ranks.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T22:37:09Z", "url": "https://kalamazoo.seoforgrowth.com/how-to-build-seo-into-web-design-to-attract-customers/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Does he have children or relatives somewhere?\nAnd for as long as he had practically been a familiar albeit unfriendly hermit to the people in my hometown, I wondered, Who took care of his needs, and how did he survive?\nTen years old, and I already possessed a very curious mind. It would be to my advantage when I am older and wanted to write about drama and life, but back then it just gave me headaches and wild imaginations.\nThe questions of Old Man Red\u2019s survival and continued existence was of paramount concern to me, admittedly not because I cared about him all that much since I didn\u2019t know him, but more because I was naturally curious and mysteries had always attracted me.\nAlone, but is he lonely? Did he know what people were saying about him behind his back? Did he know of the persistent whispers around him when he made his rare visits to town and when people he encountered quite obviously made a wide detour around him, but stayed near enough to stare and gawk, not to mention gossip?

Recognized as a technical master of this medium, Candida H\u00f6fer rhymes the vastness of \u201creal\u201d architectural spaces with those provided by the mechanical apparatus itself to create stark portraits of (mostly uninhabited) spaces generally devoid of any vestige of the personal or anecdotal. H\u00f6fer\u2019s \"Colored Wood\", 2017, is no exception in its technical virtuosity \u2013 the artist having framed the background and foreground in such claustrophobic proximity as to have effectively collapsed the distinction between the two. And yet this is a rare piece in H\u00f6fer\u2019s oeuvre as it captures not a sweeping interior view, but rather an intimate detail thereof. The \u201ccolored wood\u201d that is the work\u2019s putative referent appears vertically across the plane of the print, building a syntax of painterly strokes: light blues, crimsons, a pea green, and finally, 70s-era glossy burnt umber wood. Between these vertical bands, a hazy reticulation unites the visual field. And here, the light seems to emerge from within the flat pictorial space rather than from somewhere outside the frame. At further remove, there is the faint outline of a window, and beside it, perhaps a table or graphic emblem, though it is impossible to say for sure. This is because all of H\u00f6fer\u2019s usual grammar of spatial recession has been inverted in this work, giving us a penetrating exploration of the infinite layers of real and illusory depth that comprise the inscrutable photographic surface.\nC-print, image size: 38 x 39.7 cm, paper size: 56 x 57.7 cm, edition: 100 + 30 A.P., numbered and signed on the back, \u20ac 890.00 plus shipping.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T22:50:34Z", "url": "https://www.textezurkunst.de/artist-editions/colored-wood/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "My father in law Charlie was prescribed Clopidogrel on May 2, 2014.\nHe was in turn taken to Pittsburgh hospital in July 30, 2014 with bleeding on the brain, as diagnosed by a neurosurgeon. The doctor placed him in hospice because he could not fix the issue. Charlie died on February 13, 2015. The cause of death listed on his death certificate is subdural hemorrhage.\nThe only lawsuits I have seen relating to this issue are for Plavix, not Clopidogrel which is the generic brand. Are there any lawyers taking Clopidogrel lawsuits? What would I have to do to bring a case for this? Thank you.\nClopidogrel bisulfate, or its generic brand name Plavix, is manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The drug was approved in 1997 for prevention of blood clots and to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\nWhile the manufacturer claimed Plavix worked better than aspirin, recent studies have shown that Plavix carries no significant benefit over the much cheaper aspirin.\nThere are currently several class actions in litigation. It appears they are not accepting victims in class actions against Bristol-Myers Squibb regarding the side effects of Clopidogrel bisulfate.\nGo online and search on class actions for Clopidogrel bisulfate. You will find a good number of law firms representing victims of the side effects of Clopidogrel bisulfate in class actions and product liability claims. Feel free to contact those firms for further information.\nMy father passed away June 2016. A TIA incident brought us to our nearest hospital. There, the nurse recommended Plavix. Not even three months later he had a massive brain hemorrhage. He died from plavix being in his system before he passed away a week later.\nI read that if he took aspirin with it, which I believe he did for the headache, it increases the chance of bleeding even further. They never went over that, at least not with me in the room.\nThis stuff really shouldn\u2019t be on the market, it does not help anyone no mater how great the thought is. It\u2019s only a great way to kill your family. Hospitals have Total lack of understanding of the use of this drug. Do not take this stuff lightly.\nI don\u2019t know if I can sue them and the hospital since its been two/three years, but if its possible I will. Even if it doesn\u2019t bring back my dad. I want to fight them so at least he wouldn\u2019t have died in vain, for my family and for others.\nI had a heart attack in April 2017 and was put on a generic of Plavix. I was supposed to take it for a whole year but 2 months ago I got a letter in the mail stating the generic for Plavix (the pill I was taking) was on recall. Now I am looking for a lawyer to tell me what I should do because the whole time I was taking this medicine it wasn\u2019t helping me. I\u2019m still having trouble breathing and I have this rash all over my body. I don\u2019t know what to do but I\u2019m about to contact a lawyer.\nI am so sorry about your husband\u2019s death. Thank you very much for giving out this very important information about \u2018the court ruling\u2019. Only after I read your write up I understood why, not a single law firm is willing to go after these drug manufactures, and why they are dropping the cases.\nWith all the death and side effect incidents with this drug, FDA is claiming that \u2018enough\u2019 victims or doctors are not reporting the adverse effect to FDA so they could not recall it! The \u2018number of victims\u2019 report is their base for recall! Did you get a chance to report it to FDA? You could do it online FDA.GOV. Or call 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332) and speak to a person.\nMy husband was bruising all over his body, cardiologists said that is the side effect of clopidogrel and got a bleeding stroke in April of 2016, followed by seizures and complications from that. Fortunately, he is still alive, could not drive, quality of life completely changed, 72 year old need to be taken care of like a seven year old. Now that FDA has the authority over this drug, there is something we could do, thus our loss will not be in vein.\nWe need to write to the FDA administrator, with cc to the white house, the justice department who did the ruling, the house appropriation committee chair who is funding the FDA, the senators and the congressmen/women of our states. There are a lot of victims not able to do anything about it legally, however, collectively we could do a lot about it. If I could save one family from going through the suffering, I will be happy. Please communicate with me if you could.\nMy husband died as a result of taking Plavix following a TIA he had in January of 2012. For 6 months he took Plavix and when it came off patent in May, 2012 he was given the generic called Clopidogrel for 3 more years.\nMany of the side effects of Plavix, or the generic drug, presented in my husband, but were attributed to his existing disease, NASH \u2013 nonalcoholic cirrhosis of the liver.\nDuring the time he was on this medication he had nose bleeds, bleeding in his mouth, and constant bruising. When he had a cerebral hemorrhage and a gastro-intestinal bleed, doctors could not figure out what was happening.\nAfter his death in December of 2015, I proceeded to do some research on my own. Major side effects from these drugs are cerebral hemorrhages, gastro-intestinal bleeds, nose bleeds, gum bleeds, blood bruising and bone marrow disorder.\nIt was this last side effect that ultimately killed my husband. He developed a bone marrow disorder which led to AML leukemia. He died from this leukemia.\nIn my research I have read so many accounts of people who had been prescribed Plavix and were later diagnosed with AML leukemia. Obviously, not a coincidence. It would appear to be a direct result of taking these drugs.\nDue to the ruling by the Supreme Court Justices which stated that all generic drugs and their manufacturers, some 80% of all drugs consumed in the United States, are exempt from liability for side effects, mislabeling, or virtually any other negative reactions caused by their drugs.\nIn short, the Court ruled that the FDA has ultimate authority over pharmaceuticals in the US, and if the FDA says a drug is safe, that takes precedent over actual facts, real victims and any and all adverse reactions.\nIn other words, if the FDA says something is safe, it does not matter if that decision is wrong or the result of misrepresentation, fraud or deception on the part of the world\u2019s pharmaceutical companies.\nThere is no way to sue the FDA for being wrong and costing millions of unsuspecting Americans their lives. That result leaves millions of Americans unprotected from an industry responsible for innumerable preventable deaths in the US from use of these drugs and their side effects.\nMy husband died and there is no recourse. However, if he was holding a hot cup of coffee from McDonald\u2019s, we could have litigated this!\nPharmaceutical companies and our government, in the eyes of the Supreme Court, are putting profits before people. This decision has to be reversed.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T06:43:54Z", "url": "https://www.injuryclaimcoach.com/questions/lawsuit-for-the-generic-clopidogrel.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Toiling to resolve their populist tendencies with artiness, \u2018Resistance Is Futile\u2019 might be the most emotionally honest Manic Street Preachers album yet.\nIt\u2019s perhaps fitting for a band as multi-faceted in their identity and approach as the Manic Street Preachers that the title of their 13th album, Resistance Is Futile, should have such an ambiguous meaning. In the context of the political upheaval of the last few years, is it a call to arms to confront changing times, or is it an acceptance of defeat in the face of it? There hasn\u2019t even been any hard clues as to the band\u2019s intentions going forwards, with songwriter and chief spokesperson / propagandist Nicky Wire describing Resistance Is Futile as \u201ceither a new era or the end\u201d.\nOf course, the Manics have been in this kind of sentimental territory before with 2010\u2019s Postcards From A Young Man, which was billed by Wire as \u201cone last shot at mass communication\u201d, but this is a band that\u2019s always reserved the right to contradict itself. The It\u2019s possible to see Resistance Is Futile as the third creative re-grouping of the Manics\u2019 career, after the disappearance of their talismanic songwriter Richey Edwards forged the defiant Everything Must Go and the prospect of irrelevance sparked the glorious re-birth of 2007\u2019s Send Away The Tigers.\nBut where those two triumphs were born out of tragedy and necessity, Resistance Is Futile comes off the back of a very successful and creatively fertile period for the Manics. After the consecutive glories of 2013\u2019s pastoral, folk-influenced Rewind The Film and the fearless, European artiness of 2014\u2019s Futurology, two very different records, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any external compulsion for Wire\u2019s existential attitude this time around, other than the long-term future the Manics see for themselves. Perhaps it\u2019s the 20th anniversary The Holy Bible and Everything Must Go tours (not to mention the pretty hilarious Wales Euro 2016 anthem\u2026) that\u2019s brought this on, but it now seems to be a question of what the Manics want from themselves, all now a year away from their fifties, as opposed to what others might expect of them.\nBoth musically and thematically, Resistance Is Futile seems to be attempting to reconcile two contradictory versions of the Manics that they\u2019ve flitted between in various stages of their long career: the one looking optimistically towards the future, of rousing anthems and fearless rhetoric, which brought us Everything Must Go and Send Away The Tigers, and the pensive and melancholic Manics, the regret-filled and self-doubting Manics that recorded This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours and Rewind The Film. It wrestles to resolve their populist tendencies with their artful ones, to address the turmoil of the outside world and their place within it, and does so pretty successfully, barring a handful of ideas that don\u2019t really work.\nAs such, Resistance Is Futile is arguably the most honest Manics album, though far from being their best. The album\u2019s mood is set immediately with the lush, string-swept \u2018People Give In\u2019. Beset with worry, insecurity and a sense of all things being transitory, James Dean Bradfield exuding empathy with simple truths like \u201cpeople get tired / people get old\u201d, it\u2019s the Manics at their most humanistic \u2013 downcast, yet defiant and stoic.\nExceptional lead single \u2018International Blue\u2019, dedicated to post-war French artist Yves Klein, is a precision-targeted exocet missile of FM rock, anthemic in the same way as \u2018Motorcycle Emptiness\u2019 and peacocking with autumnal joy. It\u2019s a bit of an outlier for the record in general, as it\u2019s by far the most radio-friendly moment, but there\u2019s other moments of panorama too. The reflective \u2018Distant Colours\u2019 is a sullen beauty, bemoaning the loss of ideology and certainties in the modern world and blown up to the \u201cwidescreen melancholia\u201d that Wire feels encapsulates the album as a whole. The Manics, who\u2019ve always been switched-on, have seen an awful lot of social, political and pop music change in their time, find themselves in a great position to critique the state of the world in 2018, even though we\u2019re dimensions away from the punk and nihilist attitude of Generation Terrorists.\nThe same sentiment is echoed later in the glorious \u2018Hold Me Like A Heaven\u2019, with Bradfield sounding bewildered and pained when he looks at atomised, alienated Britain in 2018 beset with cultural nostalgia (\u201call the ties that bind have come undone\u2026 what is the future of the future?\u201d). Nicky Wire delivers a very personal moment on \u2018Liverpool Revisited\u2019, echoing the sentiments of 1998 song \u2018S.Y.M.M.\u2019 regarding the Hillsborough disaster, only this time applauding the courage and stamina of the victims\u2019 families. Wire takes the microphone himself on muted album closer \u2018The Left Behind\u2019, taking a phrase popularised during the Brexit referendum and turning it into a rumination on the Manics\u2019 current state.\nThe musical polarisation between classicism and futurism is perhaps illustrated best by comparing two of Resistance Is Futile\u2019s best tracks. The machine throb underpinning \u2018Sequels Of Forgotten Wars\u2019 is a continuation of Futurology\u2019s pan-European outlook, while the orchestrated, detailed pop of \u2018Dylan & Caitlin\u2019, a duet sung with Welsh chanteuse The Anchoress, tells the story of the Thomases\u2019 alcohol-fuelled romance. It fits into a great lineage of Manics duets (\u2018Little Baby Nothing\u2019 and \u2018Your Love Alone Is Not Enough\u2019 being the very best, obvs) and is the kind of thing that only they can do and make it work.\nHowever, there are a small handful of moments on Resistance Is Futile that aren\u2019t as resonant as the majority of the tracks. The low-key \u2018Vivian\u2019, concerning photographer Vivian Maier, is intelligent but lacks the musical heft to register proper impact with the listener. The back-to-back \u2018In Eternity\u2019, which turns potentially interesting European art-rock influences into a bit of a slog, and the clumsy rocker \u2018Broken Algorithms\u2019 threaten to derail the album entirely near the end, before the expansive \u2018A Song For The Sadness\u2019 picks things up just as they\u2019re petering out. But they\u2019re minor complaints in the context of an album that stands up wonderfully to repeated listens, just like its immediate predecessor Futurology.\nListen to Resistance Is Futile by Manic Street Preachers here via Spotify, and tell us what you think below!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T14:07:14Z", "url": "https://www.thestudentplaylist.com/review-manic-street-preachers-resistance-is-futile/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "LightSquared and former FCC chief engineer Edmond Thomas on Wednesday said the GPS test devices that were used by the National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing Executive Committee (PNT EXCOM) to test its new network were rigged by \u201cmanufacturers of GPS receivers and government end users to produce bogus results.\u201d The company said that devices from GPS manufacturers, which have claimed LightSquared\u2019s network interferes with GPS communications, were \u201ccherry picked\u201d in secret and that independent authorities were not allowed to partake or oversee the tests or test results. In addition, LightSquared said the tests focused on obsolete technology that is only used in \u201cniche market devices\u201d and that are \u201cleast able to withstand potential interference\u201d from wireless networks. Read on for more.\nAfter a list of the test devices was released to LightSquared, the company found that the only mass market device that reportedly failed the government\u2019s tests actually \u201cperformed flawlessly during Technical Working Group\u201d testing. The government also reportedly tested LightSquared\u2019s network at a power level that is 32-times greater than the level at which it will actually operate.\nLightSquared is relying on FCC approval to solidify a contract with Sprint to help build out the carrier\u2019s 4G LTE network. Sprint most recently gave LightSquared an additional 30 days to gain FCC approval, but the government has said none of LightSquared\u2019s proposed fixes will help it gain approval.\n\u201cTransparency is the only way taxpayers can be assured that the testing process is not manipulated to benefit one particular set of self interests,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cLightSquared is confident that a fair process will allow the company to move forward with its plan to deliver wireless broadband to hundreds of millions of consumers.\u201d LightSquared\u2019s full press release follows below.\nRESTON, Va., January 18, 2012 \u2013 LightSquared said today that the process used to test GPS devices by Air Force Space Command on behalf of the Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee (PNT EXCOM) was rigged by manufacturers of GPS receivers and government end users to produce bogus results, and revealed details of the testing to document its accusations.\nPNT EXCOM advises and coordinates among U.S. government agencies on GPS matters and is comprised of representatives from those agencies with GPS expertise. LightSquared has called on the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to objectively re-evaluate this initial round of testing and also to evaluate mitigation proposals the company has proposed. Additionally, the company has called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the NTIA to conduct the second round of tests on high-precision devices at an independent laboratory to ensure objectivity and transparency.\nIn a call with reporters, Jeff Carlisle, LightSquared\u2019s Executive Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Public Policy; and Geoff Stearn, LightSquared\u2019s Vice President for Spectrum Development; outlined how GPS industry insiders and government end users manipulated the latest round of tests to generate biased results. Also on the call was Edmond Thomas, former chief engineer at the FCC who explained how fair and accurate testing should be conducted.\n1. Testing was shrouded in secrecy, no transparency. The GPS manufacturers cherry-picked the devices in secret without any independent oversight authority in place or input from LightSquared. The GPS manufacturers and the government end users put non-disclosure agreements in place for the PNT EXCOM\u2019s tests, preventing any input by an independent authority or from LightSquared before the tests began. This secrecy made it impossible for independent experts to properly oversee or challenge the process and results, thereby leaving taxpayers who paid for the testing no option but to take the PNT EXCOM\u2019s word for it.\n2. The testing protocol deliberately focused on obsolete and niche market devices that were least able to withstand potential interference. When LightSquared finally obtained a list of the devices tested, after all testing in this first phase of tests had been completed, it was able to determine that the testing included many discontinued or niche market devices with poor filters or no filters. The units tested represent less than one percent of the contemporary universe of GPS devices. In fact, the only mass market device alleged to \u201cfail\u201d during this round of testing performed flawlessly during the Technical Working Group testing, which used best practice protocols agreed to by all parties, thus raising doubts about the integrity of PNT EXCOM\u2019s process.\n3. The testing standard does not reflect reality. To guarantee favorable results, the PNT EXCOM selected an extremely conservative definition of failure \u2013 one dB of interference. Independent experts agree that a one dB threshold can only be detected in laboratory settings and has no impact on GPS positional accuracy or user experience. In fact, GPS devices are designed with the ability to withstand eight dB or more of loss of sensitivity due to man-caused and natural interference. By setting the definition of interference at one dB, the testing was rigged to ensure that most receivers would fail. It should be noted that PNT EXCOM and others have justified the one dB threshold by citing an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard. However, that standard explicitly states that it does not apply to general purpose GPS receivers.\nGPS and government end users should have opened the process for transparent review, chosen a representative sample of devices that reflect the scope of general purpose GPS receivers in the marketplace today, applied best practice standards to the testing protocol, and \u2013 most importantly, the tests should have been conducted by an independent laboratory rather than by the GPS manufacturers themselves, since they had a large incentive to ensure that the tested receivers would not pass the testing.\nWhy did the government choose to ignore LightSquared\u2019s proposed power levels?\nWhy did the government choose a power level 32 times greater than the level at which LightSquared will operate?\nWhy did the test protocol select the 1dB degradation to noise as the interference standard, since it does not apply to general purpose GPS receivers and GPS units are typically designed with an 8dB level of tolerance?\nWho determined what acceptable interference is for the current round of testing?\nWhy was the testing conducted using outdated/discontinued devices rather than a representative sample of what is currently in the market?\nIsn\u2019t it a violation of conflict of interest laws for representatives of GPS manufacturers to sit on the PNT advisory board and play a central role in its consideration of LightSquared when those companies are actively lobbying on the same issue?\nIs it fair that taxpayers funded a testing regime they cannot review?\nLightSquared has agreed to meet every technical guideline requested by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), FCC and NTIA and will continue to work in collaboration with the federal government to resolve the GPS interference issues. The secretive behavior of the PNT EXCOM indicates a co-opted process. The inappropriate influence of the private sector on their decision-making has been brought to the attention of NASA\u2019s Inspector General in a separate conflict of interest complaint filed by LightSquared.\nLightSquared is asking for fair and transparent oversight of the testing process by the FCC and NTIA, much like the agencies provided in the first round of testing that was openly agreed to by all parties. Transparency is the only way taxpayers can be assured that the testing process is not manipulated to benefit one particular set of self interests. LightSquared is confident that a fair process will allow the company to move forward with its plan to deliver wireless broadband to hundreds of millions of consumers.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T16:04:40Z", "url": "https://bgr.com/2012/01/18/lightsquared-and-former-fcc-chief-engineer-say-gps-tests-were-rigged/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "This entry was posted on November 17, 2014 by PLADInc.\nIndialantic, FL -- PLAD, INC. recently showcased its revolutionary Portable Lift Assist Device at this year\u2019s EMS World Expo in Nashville, TN.\n\u201cWe recently launched our new Portable Lift Assist Device at EMLRC's ClinCon 2014 with overwhelming support and positive feedback,\u201d stated Bobby Clark, Chief Executive Officer of PLAD, Inc. \u201cWe were excited to demonstrate the PLAD again at the EMS World Expo to key decision makers in our industry.\"\n\u201cThe product speaks for itself and will be showcased at an amazing event,\" stated Matthew Nicoletti, Managing Partner of PLAD, Inc.\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reported that approximately 81,000 firefighters in the United States were injured during 2002 at a cost of $3\u20138 billion. Most injuries to firefighters occur on the fireground, and many of these injuries are musculoskeletal-related. The musculoskeletal system\u2019s primary functions include supporting the body, allowing motion and protecting vital organs. Sprains and strains, including those of the low back and abdominal regions, account for most of the musculoskeletal injuries in firefighters. And back injuries represent the vast majority of these injuries. Further, low back injury is the most common injury related to early retirement from the fire service.\nThe high rate of low back injuries can be attributed to the high-risk activities that firefighters are expected to perform, such lift assists. These tasks are often accomplished while the body\u2019s posture is ergonomically unsound or on unstable ground.\nTo purchase a Portable Lift Assist Device (P.L.A.D), please visit: www.pladinc.com. To view the P.L.A.D. in action, visit http://youtu.be/QxrqmwW_Vzs and http://youtu.be/AHX3sXqtGrA.\nIn professions such as firefighting, nursing, and first responders back injuries are a common problem when performing lift assists on individuals while on the job. Statistics show that in these professions, especially within the field of Emergency Medical Services, the rate of back injuries is very high with an increasing percentage of those back injuries being career ending. These back injures not only impact these individuals\u2019 lives, but there is a large resource and monetary impact from Workman\u2019s compensation claims that can cripple municipalities. Prior to the PLAD, there has not been a solution to lift assists that takes the possibility of back injuries out of the equation.\nFirefighter Mike Pannucci was finishing up medic school when he was tasked with a final project that required him to provide a solution to a current problem the industry faces and present that solution to the class. From his experience as a firefighter, he knew exactly what he wanted to base his project around and that would be the growing number of back injuries associated with lift assists. From this class, this assignment, the PLAD was conceived.\nLooking for assistance to help design and fabricate a device that could safely lift an individual, Mike turned to longtime friend and designer, Bobby Clark. Together, the two worked successfully on finding the right balance between a device that was extremely portable and could easily be deployed to safely and comfortably lift a person to a seated position. They went through several iterations of the PLAD until the final product that is available today got their final stamp of approval.\nPLAD's main mission is to eliminate the possibility of back injuries from performing lift assists. By creating a lifting device that is light weight and extremely portable, countless other benefits were also created in the process. In the case of firefighters, multiple teams of two no longer are required to assist in a lift where the individual weights over a certain amount. A team of two can easily deploy the PLAD and safely lift an extremely heavy individual without compromising themselves thus freeing up additional resources, which otherwise would be needed for a team lift. Commonly, when performing lift assists, it can be time consuming just trying to figure out the approach to lift the individual. With the PLAD, that guess work is a non-factor because the PLAD can be deployed within a couple of minutes, which greatly shortens the time the fallen individual is in a compromising position.\nNow that you are aware of the PLAD, the most portable lift assist device available, can you afford to send your team out in the field to perform a lift assist with the possibility of one of them injuring their backs? Would you perform that lift assist yourself?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T16:01:56Z", "url": "http://pladinc.com/blog/plad-inc-showcases-portable-lift-assist-device-at-ems-world-expo/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Small update of the BYOM modelling framework in Matlab.\n25 and 27 August: another update of BYOM (sorry, found some small errors again). Additionally, an updated version of the DEBtox1 package (also demonstrating the improved population growth rate calculation). Updates of GUTS1 and DEBkiss1 packages. And ... a totally new package: DEBkiss_tox1, which is DEBkiss turned into a TKTD model. 29 August: update of the GUTS2 and DEBkiss2 package as well. All packages now have a walk through.\n21 August: update of BYOM. Corrected a few errors and added some new functionality that will be demonstrated in future packages.\n30 June 2015: update of BYOM. Corrected some errors and included a few extra options.\n17 April 2015: update of DEBtoxM flavours Surv, GUTS and DEBtox. The DEB3 flavour is no longer offered.\n3 April 2015: major update of BYOM. Some alternative optimisation methods are included, plus the possibility to fit parameters on log-scale. And ... the possibility to publish the code in Matlab (see the walkthrough of the BYOM code). Also a new version of the manual is provided.\n18 February 2015: update of BYOM and the GUTS2 package. Main change is to avoid warnings with newer versions on Matlab (due to different way of dealing with interpolations), and the option to plot in black-and-white with different symbols (as in the DEBtoxM flavours).\n2 January 2015: tiny 2.02 update for BYOM, and extended the BYOM manual, and gave a seperate entry on the BYOM download page.\n17 December 2014: New version of the BYOM files to version 2.0. Major change is the possibility to have more than one data set per stage, and a brand new simulation engine. As of version 1.5, cleaner and simpler BYOM scripts. New packages for GUTS, DEBtox and some nice examples for the simulator! (Version 2.01 also has a small update to the manual).\n29 November 2014: New version of the BYOM files. Major change is the removal of the calculation and plotting from the basic script into an engine script, which takes away a lot of complexity from the user.\n1 May 2014. New version 1.5 of BYOM files posted over here. Also, a new package general package for DEBkiss.\n29 Jan. 2013.

{"text": "With its beautiful beaches, it's no wonder so many tourists flock to Long Beach Island every summer and why so many never want to leave. I certainly understand the feeling, I've lived on Long Beach Island for over 20 years after spending my summers here as a child and it's why I love helping people buy or sell Long Beach Island NJ real estate.\nMy name is Laura Dunlap and for years I have helped people buy or sell homes right here in Long Beach Island. Those who know Long Beach Island know that each neighborhood has its own distinct personality. To help people find the right home here, an agent has to know the area just as much as she know her clients. And I make it my mission to get to know the people I work with as well as I know Long Beach Island, the place I know and have been calling home for most of my life. It is my in-depth knowledge of the Long Beach Island communities that makes me more than just a real estate agent, but a partner in helping people buy the house of their dreams or sell their existing property quickly and for the right price. For each of my clients, I promise to work hard, stay in touch, keep them informed, offer honest advice through the entire process, and negotiate the best deal possible.\nSo whether you're looking to buy or sell Long Beach Island NJ real estate, Manahawkin NJ real estate, or Beach Haven NJ real estate, I would love to help. It could very well be the only thing I love more than the beautiful community that we call home. Contact me today to get started buying or selling Long Beach Island real estate.\nLong Beach Island is calling. Can you hear it? With the sound of every crashing wave, another memory is made\u2014another memory, in your new home in Long Beach Island. Whether you're looking to relive your childhood in a Long Beach Island vacation home or you're looking to buy or invest in Long Beach Island, Manahawkin, or Beach Haven NJ real estate; I can help you find the right property for your needs.\nHaving both bought and rented properties here in Long Beach Island, I look at the market a little differently than most real estate agents. In fact, I consider every person I work with to be a potential neighbor. And in the spirit of being a good neighbor, I will use my wealth of experience and connections to make sure you fully understand the finer details of buying Long Beach Island NJ real estate, Manahawkin NJ real estate, or Beach Haven NJ real estate.\nGive me a call today or find out more about buying Long Beach Island real estate.\nThey say that the three most important things in real estate are location, location, location. But what they neglect to mention is that location is worth very little if you don't intimately know the area and the intricacies of the specific market. So what they could be saying instead is that experience, experience, experience is what it takes to sell Long Beach Island NJ real estate, Manahawkin NJ real estate, and Beach Haven NJ real estate.\nAnd with years of experience helping people sell their Long Beach Island homes, including selling my own here, I understand on a personal level what the key is to selling real estate in Long Beach Island, Manahawkin, and Beach Haven. That key is a solid foundation of trust and the right real estate connections. In fact, I make it a point to maintain a network made up of real estate agents and perspective homebuyers.

{"text": "Educational travel is an opportunity for teachers and community leaders to use the world as their classroom. As group leaders, educators lead their students abroad on tours that range in duration from a few days to several weeks. During that time, students can experience many of the things they have read about in textbooks or learned to say in language classes, placing classroom lessons into a real world context.\nWho travels on an educational tour?\nTypically, educational tours are led by teachers who want to engage their students by taking learning outside the classroom. Group leaders are often high school teachers who teach foreign languages, social studies, art, English and science courses. But anyone who wants to enrich young people\u2019s lives can lead such a tour. Student travelers are typically in high school but can also be in middle school or college. Anyone who wants to learn about the world by experiencing it firsthand can find a place on an educational tour.\nWhat are the benefits for teachers who take students on a tour?\nFor teachers, the biggest benefit is that they are changing their students\u2019 lives. Many teachers credit their experiences on tour with making them better teachers, and travel can benefit schools as a whole as well. Students who travel often return more confident with a new understanding of the world around them, and their experiences help promote cultural understanding among students and teachers.\nWhat are the benefits for students who go on a tour?\nIn addition to the life-changing benefits of seeing the world, students who travel on an educational tour can earn credit by completing coursework associated with some of the tours. As more and more colleges expect students to have had international experiences, educational travel enhances students\u2019 college applications and prepares them for a more international higher education experience. Many students have also credited traveling on an educational tour with inspiring them to study abroad and even influencing their career direction.\nRome: Pizza-making \u2013 students learn how to make a classic Italian favorite from expert chefs!\nMadrid: Flamenco or Fado lessons \u2013 students learn the age-old art of the Fado song or the rhythmic steps of flamenco.\nLondon: Globe Theatre Workshop \u2013 students practice the dramatic art by reciting the works of Shakespeare and learning about stagecraft.\nChina: Cultural immersion \u2013 students get a glimpse of Chinese culture by visiting a local family for dinner, visiting a school and learning about traditional and modern Chinese medicine with a visit to a local hospital.\nAfrica: Young Rangers activities \u2013 students partake in hands-on activities designed to give them a feel for what life is like in the wilderness.\nSPECIALIZED OR MORE GENERAL EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS OF TOURISM?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T07:05:44Z", "url": "https://www.tourism-review.com/travel-tourism-magazine-way-for-knowledge-educational-tours-article1005", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "When and why did you first join SMART?\nI went to the first SMART Summit in 2005 in Marlborough. I was very interested in what they had to say so I joined right then and there. I was always interested in helping animals in any way I can and thought this was a perfect way. I have been volunteering ever since \u2014 with just about all the teams in SMART.\nI am a Certified Veterinary Technician and also the Veterinary Services Coordinator (in simple terms hospital manager) in the vet hospital at Zoo New England, based at the Franklin Park Zoo.\nWhat is your most heartwarming memory about deploying with SMART?\nI have many great memories of my deployments with SMART but I would probably say the most heartwarming was Munson, MA after the tornado in 2011. We were brought a baby rabbit (I would say just a week or so old) and it was very cold and lethargic. We really didn\u2019t think it would survive but I still got up every couple of hours to change the hot water bottles and see how it was doing. Finally in the middle of the night it started to come around and became more aware. I offered it a small amount of formula and it finally ate. The next morning it was taken to a rabbit rehab place and she nursed it back until it could be released. It is the \u201clittle\u201d things that make this job great. If you go to the SMART website the first picture that pops up is me holding the bunny the morning after we received it just before it went to the rabbit rehab.\nIs there anything unusual that you keep in your Go Kit???\nI don\u2019t think there is anything unusual, but some important things that I have found out about by being deployed are definitely kept in there. One item is a set of kneepads for kneeling on the cement floors while cleaning cages. Another is a pair of shoe inserts that give extra comfort for my feet when I am standing 12 hours or more on a cement floor. The third most helpful thing that I have is my Leatherman (pocket tool kit) \u2014 it has come in handy many times. And above all \u2014 I do not go anywhere with out my Aleve and several snacks!!\nWhat\u2019s the first thing you do after a deployment to take care of yourself?\nI guess the first thing I do is go home and take a long hot shower. Then I play with my cats that are usually unhappy that I have not been home. I usually have to go back to work the next day but sometimes just telling friends and family about my experiences help me to forget about some of the bad times and just relive the happy times and the good that I have helped with.\nWhat would you tell other people about joining SMART?\nI would encourage anyone to join. I would tell anyone that the board and the operational team leaders are great people and work very hard to keep this organization working in an organized fashion. The volunteers are a huge help and without them we could not help in as many places as we have been able to. If you love and care for animals and want to help them, then joining SMART is definitely a good start! The trainings are very helpful and even though I have been working in the animal world for 25 plus years I always learn something new in the trainings and deployments. I have met many people by joining SMART that have become great friends and I know when I work and train with them I can count on them to help me learn and stay safe.\nSMART would like to thank Sharon for all of her efforts on behalf of animals, both as a volunteer and in her work as a Veterinary Technician.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T05:04:01Z", "url": "http://smartma.org/smart-volunteer-spotlight-sharon-okeefe/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

METHODS: The proliferation of PC-3 cells were analyzed by MTT and H3-TdR incorporation. The effects of cell cycle and apoptosis of synchronized cells were observed through flow cytometry. RT-PCR methods were used to explore the mRNA expression level of cyclin D1, bcl-2, bax. RESULTS: The growth and DNA synthesis of PC-3 cell were inhibited with the lycopene concentration increased, and lycopene also could change the cell cycle distribution, i. e. increasing the proportion of G0/G1 phase and descending the proportion of S and G2/M phase, and induce the apoptosis. RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA expression level of cyclin D1 and bcl-2 were down regulated, while the level of bax was up regulated.

{"text": "I, Han Kim, was given the task of updating the design of our APSU GIS website. From first glance, the website looks great, and looks like something any business owner may be proud of, but the goal is to make a simple, clean, user-friendly experience. This is where I had the opportunity to transfer the WordPress skills I\u2019ve learned from school and my freelance work to optimize a site with UX design as a priority. That was the goal, but how do we go about achieving this goal?\nFirst is to identify who your target market is and what is the main purpose of the website. Our target market is our past GIS clients, and new business clients looking for GIS solutions. The main purpose of the site is to educate, bring awareness to our projects and students, while developing a future client.\nThe process of having a great UX (user-experience) is being able to keep the user\u2019s attention, while helping them navigate to the resources that they are looking for. While having our website open, I made a complete list of what needs to be removed and what needs to be added.

{"text": "America\u2019s Best Colleges \u2013 Every single college in our country aspires to be in this list released every year by the US News and World Report. This ranking is by far one of the most authentic. What does the recently released college rankings show us about our education system?\nIf you first look at the drawbacks of this particular measuring system, you can see that the rankings are based more on the type and number of students admitted by the colleges rather than on the quality of education they impart.\nOver the past few years, there is a complete change of algorithm. All said and done, even today, these rankings are all about selectivity and prestige. So, what are the measures taken to compile the ranking?\nFor one, the magazine takes a faculty survey to determine academic reputation of colleges. Next, based on applicant percentage admitted into the college and their SAT scores, the magazine then determines the level of the institution\u2019s admissions selectivity. Other factors taken into account include graduation rates, admission and retention rates and financial resources.\nLogically it follows that if institutions want to climb the ranks, they must reject more applicants, increase SAT benchmarks and attract better students. In the process, most of them are forced to increase tuition too.\nPlaying the numbers game perfectly, many institutions recently have gained the status of high risers. For instance, the George Washington University, through the 2000s, was successful in lowering admission rates from 49 to 33 per cent, built posh dorms and jacked its tuition. These measures led the college to be ranked 54 this year from being unranked.\nToday, the University of Richmond is ranked 30 from being unranked in the national liberal arts ranking. This feat was achieved by the institution by lowering its admit rate to 31% from previous 48% and by increasing tuition rate by 31% in 2004-2005.\nAs compared to any other area where competition naturally benefits customers with companies vying with each other to offer many benefits and to attract more. In the field of higher education, sadly, competition means maximizing market share by serving only customers who can pay.\nColleges continue to build more amenities for students. This in turn leads to a situation where they restrict access based on choosing students who can pay for the said amenities. Colleges continue to remain selective especially after they start rising in rankings as naturally, they are in demand.\nIn the long run, families and students are the ones who lose. This is a game where colleges definitely prosper and many of them are also able to achieve their goal which by far is nothing more than rising in the US News rankings.\nSome of the smaller liberal arts colleges feature on top of the list which also ranked Harvard at 6th place. A depressing fact is that the 75 per cent bench mark was met only by 98 out of 3,100 four-year colleges in our country.\nOne of the biggest blunders we continue to commit here is to define best colleges based not on the quality of education they impart to students but solely on those that enrol the best students who can assure return-on-investment. The focus for good colleges should be not on rankings but on giving opportunities for 96% of our students who go elsewhere.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T14:43:45Z", "url": "http://www.higheredspace.com/index.php/blog/blogdetail?bid=12347", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Today I will be reviewing Organic Harvest Anti Pigmentation Cream. I\u2019ve tested this product for good 2 months. Since I tested this Anti Pigmentation Cream fro Jan end, I can tell you how it fares in both seasons \u2013 summer and winter. Be ready for a detailed review of this product!\nFirst, a little background on my skin \u2013 I\u2019ve dry combination skin. My t-zone is super oily especially my nose and my cheeks & forehead usually run dry. My skin is super sensitive and acne & blemish prone. I am prone to cystic acne as well (will talk about how I conquered cystic acne in another post).\nP.S. Always keep in mind even if you & I have similar skin, what worked for me might not work for you.\nThe pure ingredients like organic daisy flowers extract have been integrated efficaciously to provide an even pigmentation and prevent melanin synthesis so effectively that you will have your skin turning visibly softer and glowing. A natural remedy for pigmented skin, age spot, blemishes, sunburn and tanned skin, this anti-pigmentation cream possesses the benefit of a full-fledged treatment, which clarifies the skin while averting the appearance of any future discoloration, thus, leaving the skin fresh and youthful.\nAqua, Organic Daisy Flower Extract, White Mulberry Extract and Vitamin \u2013 C in Cream base.\nI usually apply a moisturizer first on my cleansed face then apply this cream in night. Topped it with facial oil during winters. I don\u2019t apply it in day time (along with night time) as mentioned by brand cos\u2019 the product contains Vitamin C in it. Vitamin C makes skin sensitive to sun, even though I apply sunscreen I wanted to be on a safer side. The sun is anyway too harsh in India.\nMy first impression of this cream was that it felt dry & stretchy on my skin. It felt too stretchy in applying the cream as it finish in matte. Keep in mind it was during the Jan end, peak winter, when I tried it for the first time. So I started to apply facial oil after applying this cream. But during application it still felt stretchy so I started to apply a moisturizer before slathering this cream on. Since it was winter, I could get away with so much layering. No I didn\u2019t face any acne breakout.\nAfter a month\u2019s use, I did observe that my fresh acne scars (I had an acne breakout as a reaction to stage makeup) were fading very lightly. The appearance of lil\u2019 pores on my upper cheeks seemed to even out after applying the cream. But didn\u2019t see any effect of any sort on my previous acne spots and the discoloration. I know for a fact that anti pigmentation creams take time working on old scars and discoloration. So I was ready to be patient with it.\nAfter two month\u2019s of use of Organic Harvest Anti Pigmentation Cream, the fresh scars faded a lot. I noticed an overall brightening on face. But nothing on the discoloration around mouth areas (if it lessened, it\u2019s like barely noticeable). Old acne scars were still there with very very slight fading (it can also be cos\u2019 I started being somewhat consistent with my skincare). However, overall appearance of pores seemed to be better even in tropical hot March in India.\nFades new acne scars significantly in two month\u2019s time.\nPores seemed to look evened out.\nDoes give an overall brightening effect.\nNo to very very slight fading on old acne scars.\nNo effect on slight discoloration/pigmentation around mouth.\nDry skinned beauties might need a moisturizer along with it.\nGood for oily skinned beauties as it is mattifying.\nDoesn\u2019t clog pores nor does cause any acne breakout.\nDecent cream to use in night time.\nDisclaimer \u2013 The product was sent to me by PR for review purposes but the review is 100% honest. Real Girl Talks will always keep it real with you, there\u2019s no place for bs here!\nThat stuff sounds so good. I want to use it now.\nThanks for sharing babe! I suffer from pigmentation issues after acne scarring and definitely want to try this product out!\nGreat post, thanks for sharing. Sounds like a cool product!\nOMG this stuff sounds amazing! Need to try it!\nI\u2019m glad it worked partially for you \u2013 although it didn\u2019t work on older marks it\u2019s nice it worked on the newer ones. Definitely something you\u2019d have to consistently use to get the benefits from!\nGood to know it works in dealing with new acne scars. Thanks for sharing your review dear!\nThat is a not-so-bad rating at all. Lots of positive things said. Thanks for your honest review. Helps a lot.\nHappy Easter and Sunday to you beautiful.\nOmg this sounds sooo amazing!! I have terrible hyper-pigmentation, so this would be super handy!\ni need to try this! got so many red marks on my skin, and i love that it\u2019s organic!\nIt seems like it takes awhile, but with consistent use you will get results. Thanks for the honest review.\nI didn\u2019t even know there was anything like this out there!! Sounds wonderful!!\nThanks for the review. I never used anything like this before.\nThanks for your thoughts on this, babe! I love hearing about new products!\nI wish this scar lightener is available in the Philippines.\nI adore natural, paraben free cosmetics. This sounds really good!\nIt sounds like a great product, I\u2019ll have to check it out! Thanks for sharing!\nSounds like something my oily skin would like. I have had the same experience with Vitamin C products, they work much better on fresh scars than on older ones. No clue why.\nI haven\u2019t heard of this brand before but this product sounds really nice, glad it helped with the overall brightening!\nMaybe I should try this product as I have some discolouration too. Thanks for the honest review!\nSounds like a great product hun! Thanks for the review.\nSounds like a decent cream and with a reasonable price tag too. Good that you saw some differences albeit small ones.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T00:59:15Z", "url": "http://realgirltalks.com/2018/03/30/organic-harvest-anti-pigmentation-cream-review/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Independent of the application, whether in satellite optics, video lenses or endoscopes \u2013 aspheres have already become indispensable in a wide range of highly versatile technical fields of application. Regardless of the system\u2019s size, they all have to meet one requirement: to be precise. To meet quality requirements, continued development of aspheric production and the trend towards miniaturization demand for faster and more accurate measuring methods. Measurement of the complex surfaces of aspheres is still challenging. Different measuring methods are used depending on measuring task and speed as well as surface structure. Among others, a distinction is made between non-contact and tactile measurement. The basic principle of measuring aspheric components during production based on tactile measuring methods is presented in the following.\nWhy do we need measurement technology?\nMeasurement technology plays a significant role in the production of precision optics. asphericon manufactures aspheric optics by means of CNC-controlled technologies from almost all available glass types, but also from plastics, metal and crystals (for example, CaF2, germanium, silicon). Accurate knowledge of shape and surface form deviation of the lens is necessary in each processing step to optimize the production process. With a growing demand on optics (not only for asphericon), there is also an increasing demand for production-oriented measurement technology.\nThe surface geometry of an asphere deviates from a sphere, but it is still rotationally symmetric. Through the rotation of the lens during machining (Fig.1), grinding tools leave rotationally symmetric structures on unfinished lenses. For the grinding process, it usually is sufficient in sense of the measuring technique to monitor the surface contour to optimize the next working step. The advantage of this simple measurement is, among other things, a short measuring time, which contributes to the optimization of the entire processing time.\nIn addition to measurement tasks and process steps, as already mentioned, a distinction is made between different measurement methods. In the following, we will only discuss the tactile measurement methods by means of an exemplary presentation of various devices. This type of measurement technique is based on scanning of object surfaces, for example with ruby contact points.\nThe simplest way to determine the shape of a rotationally symmetric object is to determine the surface contour. A so-called profilometer (Fig. 2) is used for this purpose. With aid of a ruby tip, which probes the measuring object in a straight line across the zenit and records the deflection of the contact point in z-direction perpendicular to its track.\nFig. 3 shows a sample protocol of a tactile measurement. To determine this deflection, a constant measuring force is required, pressing the probe onto the lens as well a stiff probe system. Profilometers are used between two steps of the grinding process, since possible damage caused by the ruby tip can be removed in further manufacturing steps.\nA more complex form of tactile measuring devices are 3D coordinate measuring systems (Fig. 4). These can also be used for measuring aspheres. The measuring object is traced with a probe tip whose position is determined via 3 measuring axes in Cartesian coordinates. The measurement of rotationally symmetric test objects done with a form tester uses cylinder coordinates, therefore the form tester is equipped with a highly precise axis of rotation, the so-called C-axis.\nFig 5. shows an exemplary measuring curve of a form tester MarForm MFU 200 Aspheric 3D. After initializing the measurement, to determine the zenith of the measuring object, a straight measurement is performed along the largest radius. This measurement is executed in tracking mode. Therefore, a constant pressure is used to guide the tip along the profile and record the change of the z coordinate.\nBesides profile measurements, form tester can be used for diverse applications such as determination of roundness, cylindricity and run.\nThe use of tactile measuring methods within the polishing process allows a relatively rapid knowledge of the surface contour of lenses. On the other hand, a decisive disadvantage is the possible damage of the lens surface by the probe. Any damage that may occur, however, could possibly be removed in later work steps. The resolution capability depends directly on the radius of the probe tip, which acts as a low-pass filter. Structures which are significantly smaller than the probe tip cannot be detected correctly (see detailed view in Fig. 2). Highly curved lenses can also lead to limitations of the measuring accuracy due to the steep slope.\nIf the advantages of tactile metrology methods are not sufficient, it is worth looking at optical measuring devices. Regardless of what should be measured, measuring task and measuring instrument have to be coordinated well in each case. The selection of the measuring method, tactile or optical, is therefore never either one or the other. The different procedures can and should be used complementary. We are going to discuss optical measurement methods with their advantages and disadvantages in a separate article.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T15:53:52Z", "url": "https://www.asphericon.com/en/measurement/noncircular-in-perfection-part-1-tactile-measurement/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The outdoor shower area has been rebuilt to eliminate a step, and easy-to-turn handles will be installed on doors.\nThroughout San Diego, a growing number of public buildings and streets are getting retrofitted as the city steps up spending to tackle a backlog of projects to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nSan Diego used to spend about $1.5 million a year on such projects. Now it\u2019s spending $10 million more per year on curb cuts, ramps, audible signals and detectable warning tiles at street intersections, among other improvements to remove barriers to access.\nMayor Jerry Sanders has committed to spending the additional $50 million over five years to improve access, in part by allocating proceeds from the sales of surplus city properties.\n\u201cBefore the mayor came into the office, we were just doing a trickle of projects. We are doing a lot of projects now,\u201d said David Jarrell, deputy chief operating officer for public works.\nAdvocates for the disabled said the improvements would help cut down the city\u2019s liability. Cities across the country have been sued for failure to improve access. San Diego was sued in 1997 by disabled residents who claimed they had been denied equal access to Qualcomm Stadium. The lawsuit was settled after the city agreed to spend $5.25 million to equip the stadium with new elevators, ramps, parking spaces and seating.\nBill Harris, a Sanders\u2019 spokesman, said the desire to do the right thing \u2013 not legal exposure \u2013 drove the mayor\u2019s commitment to ADA compliance. \u201cIt\u2019s not about avoiding litigation. It\u2019s about ensuring equal access,\u201d Harris said.\nAccording to the city, more than 500 curb ramps were installed in the past two years. About $19 million of projects are in design stages and an additional $4 million in jobs are under construction.\nFacilities being retrofitted range from police stations and recreation centers to branch libraries and teen centers.\nCindi Jones, director of the Center for an Accessible Society in San Diego, said improvements have been made, but the city still has a long way to go. She uses a scooter and her husband uses a wheelchair.\nIn South Park, where she and her husband have lived for 30 years, a curb cut was installed on their block about a year ago, Jones noted. She\u2019s looking forward to more curb cuts in her neighborhood.\nThe city\u2019s former disability services coordinator, Linda Woodbury, had said the city needed to spend $500 million on ADA compliance, but the mayor\u2019s office has disputed that figure. Woodbury was fired in 2006, a day after Sanders first proposed spending $50 million more on access projects. The city later settled a wrongful termination suit.\nLouis Frick, executive director of Access to Independence in San Diego, said the access features benefit society as a whole.\n\u201cYou see people all the time with baby strollers, delivery truck drivers, where they are using the curb cuts to get up and down the sidewalks,\u201d he said.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T06:27:18Z", "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-1m27ada235845-city-taking-disabled-access-projects-2009feb27-story.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Elvis Costello played a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc\u2019s 12 songs. And to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all them well.\nOver a career of more than 40 years, singer Elvis Costello has been a punk provocateur, a seminal new wave voice, a contemporary pop singer and even a classic crooner. And there have been fans of each of Costello\u2019s career ventures.\nSo how to satisfy everyone coming to see Costello kick off the North American leg of his latest tour at Sands Bethlehem Event Center to support yet another venture \u2013 his very strong new disc \u201cLook Now\u201d?\nOn Friday, Costello did his best to do just that, playing a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc\u2019s 12 songs.\nAnd to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all well \u2013 not afraid to revisit not only the songs of his earlier career, but also carrying the spirit of them into the newer songs.\nPerhaps after surviving cancer surgery that canceled the end of his European leg, the 64-year-old Costello was emboldened, or re-invigorated.\nEither way, his performance, and voice, was stronger than when he played the Sands in 2016.\nBacked by a crack three-man band and two female singers, Costello opened the show with \u201cThis Year\u2019s Girl\u201d from his 1978 sophomore disc, \u201cThis Year\u2019s Model,\u201d with its swirling synth reviving that new wave sound.\nHe followed that with two 1980s deeper cuts: a forceful \u201cHoney, Are You Straight or Are You Blind,\u201d and \u201cClubland,\u201d with Costello\u2019s \u201870s rocking edge. On the latter, Costello even held a finger to his nose to hush the crowd as he played a scrubbing lead and sang with a \u201cWatching the Detectives\u201d affect.\nLater offerings from the new disc were even better. The disc\u2019s new single \u201cUnder Lime\u201d had very much that 1977 vibe that ushered in new wave. \u201cWhy Won\u2019t Heaven Help Me\u201d was pretty rocking. The slow guitar-and-piano \u201cStripping Paper\u201d was a clear reminder or the Elvis of old, and the slow, sensitive \u201cSuspect My Tears\u201d had some of his best vocals of the night, as he reached for a falsetto.\nEarly in the show, the older songs Costello played were nearly all deeper cuts: \u201cNew Lace Sleeves\u201d from 1981\u2019s \u201cTrust\u201d; a rocking, new-wavey \u201c(I Don\u2019t Want to Go To) Chelsea,\u201d with good lead guitar.\nSo that when he did play a hit \u2013 his 1977 U.S. breakthrough \u201cWatching the Detectives,\u201d (in the same darkened-stage presentation as the last time he was at the Sands) it got a huge crowd reaction \u2013 and deservedly so.\nCostello later did the same with later songs: A largely voice-and-acoustic guitar version of 1986\u2019s \u201cIndoor Fireworks\u201d to a big cheer from the crowd, and closed the main set with a faster, more rocking \u201cCan You Hear Me\u201d from his last disc, 2013\u2019s \u201cWise Up Ghost\u201d that segued right into the hit \u201cPump It Up,\u201d thumping, urgent and rocking.\nCostello\u2019s encore stretched eight songs and 40 minutes.\nIt opened with one of the night\u2019s best: a barely instrumented, mostly a cappella \u201cAllison,\u201d with his two female backup singers. It got a huge cheer. Then a stark and spare, piano-and-voice \u201cAccidents Will Happen,\u201d on which he reached for a high and powerful end note.\nHe used that same vocal approach on \u201cI Still Have That Other Girl,\u201d which he also wrote with Bacharach, \u2013 really singing it --and paired that with a new Bacharach co-write, \u201cHe\u2019s Given Me Things,\u201d from the new disc.\nCostello flubbed the start of that song slightly, and after saying \u201cthis is the first night,\u201d re-started it dramatically better. He followed that with another early deeper cut, \u201cGreen Shirt,\u201d which started stripped, then built as the crowd clapped along.\nAnd then a six-minute version of his 1979 hit \u201c(What\u2019s So Funny \u2018Bout) Peace Love and Understanding,\u201d with a wonderful chorus coda.\nThat completed Costello\u2019s journey of giving everyone what they wanted.

{"text": "ESG integration is gaining more traction in private equity. Robeco\u2019s latest Private Equity Engagement Report concludes that fund managers in the company\u2019s private equity ESG Program have taken further steps to embrace ESG factors and integrate them into their investment processes.\n\u201cIf we look at the activities of PE fund managers in the last year, we can conclude that ESG factors have become further integrated into their investment process.\u201d, states the report in its introduction. Recommendations by the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, the adoption of the European Commission\u2019s Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth and the publication of a guidance document on ESG Monitoring, Reporting and Dialogue in Private Equity by PRI suggest that this positive trend will continue.\nIn the twelfth edition of the ESG Engagement Report1 Robeco Private Equity documents the activities of PE managers that are part of its ESG Engagement Program.\n2017 was a year in which General partners (GPs) continued to strengthen their ESG integration in investment, monitoring and reporting practices which has translated into stable overall ESG scores.\nThe average ESG score for the 63 fund managers that participated in last year\u2019s survey was 69%, compared to 66% in 2016 and 59% in 2015. Meanwhile, the median ESG score stands at 69%, versus 69% in 2016 and 64% in 2015. These figures indicate that most fund managers now have functioning ESG frameworks in place.\nThe results are based on an annual assessment by Robeco Private Equity that uses a reporting and assessment tool developed by the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). A growing number of investors in the private equity world are now signing up to the PRI and its goals.\nThe reputational risk of private equity portfolio companies monitored by Robeco Private Equity remains relatively low. The analysis of ESG-related news stories and alerts by RepRisk2 shows that the majority were not involved in any ESG-related incidents. Those that received negative media attention experienced relatively low impact and coverage. To increase awareness of ESG issues and encourage better communication, Robeco Private Equity continuously engages with fund managers whose portfolio companies have had to deal with incidents.\nIn their role of active owner of portfolio companies and the extended control this entails (compared to public companies), the PE managers are in a good position to promote the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs3).\nIn 2017 the number of PE fund managers that committed to contributing to these SDGs increased further. In terms of the contribution to specific goals, most portfolio companies contributed to SDG 7 and SDG 12, which relate to sustainable energy and sustainable consumption and production.\nDespite the increasing focus on SDGs, the report also recognizes that SDG-related and impact reporting is still in its infancy and most of the managers first need to develop consistent ESG reporting frameworks.\nAn analysis of how PE managers currently manage climate-related risks and opportunities also indicated that half of the respondents have already incorporated climate-related risks and opportunities into their investment strategy and process in some way. In addition, 38% of the fund managers have integrated their process for climate-related risks into their overall risk management.\nHowever, only 24% of managers currently engage with their portfolio companies to encourage better disclosure and practices relating to climate-related risks. The survey results also showed that only about one-fifth of managers currently use emission data or analysis in investment decision-making. These percentages show clear potential for improvement.\nRobeco Private Equity\u2019s ESG Engagement program, introduced in 2014, aims to encourage private equity fund managers to implement ESG best practices in their investment process. Through its ESG activities, which have been recognized by the PRI with an A+ rating, Robeco Private Equity aims to draw the attention of PE managers to ESG issues and assist them in their efforts.\nAs part of the program, private equity fund managers undergo an annual ESG assessment which serves as input for dialogue on potential improvements. Robeco Private Equity\u2019s ESG engagement program strives to contribute to improving the risk-reward characteristics of client portfolios and enhance the added value of private equity fund managers.\n1 Please note that we have changed the year referencing in the title of our annual ESG engagement report. The data that fund managers reported to us relate to the end of calendar year 2017, but the report was written and published in 2018. Henceforth the year of publication will therefore be recorded in the title of our annual ESG reports.\n2 RepRisk, a leading business intelligence provider specialized in environmental, social and governance risk analytics to monitor the reputational risk of portfolio investments.\n3 SDGs represent the global sustainability agenda for 2030 and provide a systematic framework for dealing with the most pressing social and environmental challenges globally.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T18:31:41Z", "url": "https://www.robeco.com/uk/insights/2018/08/robeco-private-equity-publishes-2018-esg-engagement-report.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Both are members of OBOD but also pursue their own individual and group work within an Irish context.\nThe Contemporary Druids are a small grove located in the Pacific Northwest of the USA. They grew up together in Christian and secular homes but found as young adults they wanted more out of their spiritual lives than they were finding on their previous paths. They wanted to explore a spiritual connection to nature, find a higher kinship with the living breathing world and honor their ancestral roots. Soon they began exploring Pagan belief systems and the tenets of Druidism resounded so strongly they knew they had found their way home.\nLooking to tie their newfound spiritual journey into their modern American lives they reached out to likeminded individuals to share their journey with and found a supportive, loving and kind community.\nCead m\u00edle f\u00e1ilte!

Raised in a non-denominational Judeo-Christian household, Hannah was not content to let go of her personal relationship with Yeshua when she found Druidry, and so she did not. Blending together traditional Christian beliefs with Druidry at first seemed impossible, but now practicing Druidry seems like God's plan for Hannah all along. With a blend of ancestors from Africa, England, Scotland, Ireland, and the Americas, her diverse background has definitely made the Druid goal of attaining deeper knowledge and wisdom very interesting indeed. You'll most often find Hannah with her head buried in a book, typing away at her latest story, or worshiping God in His first church: Nature.\nNick O'Connor is the regional co-ordinator for Surrey and North Hampshire for the Pagan Federation.

{"text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Fighting in the Shiite stronghold of Sadr City killed 23 Iraqis yesterday, hospital officials said, and the U.S. military reported five troop deaths, as April showed signs of becoming the worst month for U.S. forces in Iraq since September.\nAt least 11 of the Iraqi deaths occurred when mortar shells landed in residential neighborhoods. Men rushed wounded children to overcrowded emergency rooms in Sadr City hospitals, on foot because of a ban on all vehicular traffic. In some parts of Sadr City, masked militiamen bearing machine guns and grenade launchers remained on the streets.\nOfficials at local hospitals have put the death toll in the neighborhood at more than 70 since Sunday, but it was not clear if those figures included militia fighters.\nThousands of Sadr City residents have fled for other neighborhoods. Prices in local markets were soaring as supplies dwindled, a result of suppliers' inability to bring in goods. Iraqi and U.S. forces appeared to be penetrating deeper into the neighborhood, one local journalist said.\nThere were no signs that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was pulling back on his offensive against Shiite militias, which has sparked fighting between Iraqi and U.S. forces and militiamen loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Al-Maliki's deadline for fighters to hand in heavy weapons expired Tuesday, but the latest clashes showed that rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and rockets remained in militia hands.\nBaghdad had spent part of yesterday quieter than in recent days, because of a curfew imposed to prevent clashes and protests marking the anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9, 2003.\nAl-Sadr had called for a huge march in Baghdad to mark the anniversary of Hussein's ouster and to protest the U.S. presence and al-Maliki's offensive. The cleric says the offensive, which began March 25 in the southern city of Basra, is targeting his Mahdi Army and is a ploy to cripple his political movement in advance of provincial elections planned for October.\nHis fighters have risen up against Iraqi and U.S. forces, virtually collapsing a cease-fire that al-Sadr announced last August and that was credited with bringing a sharp drop in violence nationwide.\nAlthough U.S. and Iraqi officials maintain that they are targeting criminal elements or \"special groups\" that did not abide by al-Sadr's truce, U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker acknowledged yesterday that the Basra offensive had drawn in others.\n\"A dangerous development in the immediate wake of the Basra operation was what appeared to be a reunification between special groups and JAM,\" he told lawmakers in Washington, using the acronym for al-Sadr's militia.\nCrocker and Gen. David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, gave lawmakers their assessments of the war during two days of hearings in Washington that ended yesterday.\nThe surge in troop deaths since the Basra offensive has underscored their contention that security gains witnessed in recent months easily could be reversed. At least 30 U.S. troops have died in Iraq since the Basra operation began, most in Baghdad; at least 19 have died in Iraq so far this month, representing the highest daily average since last September.\nThe deaths announced yesterday brought to at least 4,031 the number of U.S. troops to die in Iraq since the war began in March 2003. Brief military statements said three of the soldiers died in roadside bomb blasts: two in northeastern Baghdad and one east of the city.

{"text": "London-based artist Sam Smith presents Notes (2014), a live video essay performance in which a constellation of poor images are brought together into a stream of collaged audio-visual vignettes. Fragmented scenes draw together key reference points from Smith's practice including the mediation of object via the camera eye's flattening gaze; the cinematic framing of landscape; and, through architecture, an audience's complicity in the projection image.\nFor KW's *Chora*, Smith incorporates targeted satellite imagery, text overlays, and subtle software interventions to open up new connections inside his shifting archive of sampled material. From a central computer, the combination of data is beamed onto a site-specific architectural screen, where layered surfaces push rectilinear footage into three-dimensional relationships. By deploying the windowed environment of the Mac operating system, and re-purposing the functionality for which it was created, the artist constitutes a post-cinema, hyperlinked apparatus.\nSam Smith currently lives and works between London and Sydney. From 2013 to 2014 he was part of the International Studio Programme at K\u00fcnstlerhaus Bethanien, Berlin. Recent solo projects include **Notes on the Apparatus** selected by Vdrome for the Artists' Film Biennial, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London (2014); **Frames of Reference**, a solo exhibtion at The Royal Standard as part of their Liverpool Biennial 2014 program (2014); and **Form Variations** at K\u00fcnstlerhaus Bethanien, Berlin (2014).\nThe event is kindly supported by the Australian Embassy, Berlin.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T18:56:37Z", "url": "https://www.kw-berlin.de/en/sam-smith-notes/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "I have been busy baking Christmas cookies for the last couple of days. This is one of the first ones I did. It is a butter sugar cookie that you can flavor anyway you like and color anyway you like. I had intended to make these redder than they are but after about 10 drops of food coloring in them I decided that was enough. When I make these again I will use paste food coloring to get a deeper more intense color like a Christmas red. I like pink and green together so it worked for me. Store these in an airtight container and they should last for days.\nConfused as to what type of butter, shortening or margarine to use and does it make a difference? You bet it does. Vegetable shortening, margarine and butter in some recipes are interchangeable. Ask most experienced bakers, though, and they will tell you that one of their secret weapons is plain, pure butter. Butter serves several purposes in cookie baking, it tenderizes and conveys the flavor of the cookie.\nCompare the difference between a shortbread cookie and that of biscotti. Shortbread cookies seem to almost melt in your mouth, where as biscotti has a much lower butter content and are hard and crunchy. If a cookie recipe calls for butter, I\u2019d use the butter, especially in cookies where butter is the flavor of the cookie. On the other hand cookies such as Molasses or gingerbread, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use shortening. Do not use \u201creduced fat\u201d or whipped butter products when you bake cookies, they can contain up to 58% water.\nYou want the cookies to spread more: Use all butter or add 1 to 2 tablespoons liquid (water, milk or cream) or use a low-protein flour such as bleached all-purpose (but not one that is chlorinated) or add 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar.\nYou want the cookies to spread less: Cut the sugar by a few tablespoons or add 1/4-1/2 cup additional flour.\nYou want the cookies to have a chewy quality: Melt the butter instead of simply using it at room temperature.\nBrightly colored Christmas Pinwheel Cookies are perfect on the holiday cookie tray.\nIn your mixer bowl combine butter and powdered sugar. When combined add the egg and flavoring.\nAdd the flour, baking soda and salt. Mix well. Divide dough in half.\nAdd food coloring of choice to each half. Fold the dough over and over until it is mixed in.\nTake a tablespoon of each dough and put together to form a ball. Roll the dough into a long snake about 6 inches long. Starting at one end roll the dough into a cylinder. Dip the edges into the sprinkles and place on a greased baking sheet.\nBake for about 8 minutes. Do not overbake. Let set on cookie sheet for about 5 minutes when the cookies come out of the oven. Remove to a wire rack to cool.\nWould you like to try another recipe?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T04:27:52Z", "url": "https://recipesfoodandcooking.com/2016/12/19/christmas-pinwheel-cookies/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Tulsa race riot survivor: \"Learn how to forgive, but never forget\"\nSAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- A 100-inch, high definition screen projects an intense college basketball game. Massage therapists rub the nervous tensions of men and women away. Scissors skillfully cut men's hair. Two chandeliers adorn the main room, complimented by brick walls and a glass bar that doubles as a retail counter.\nSean Heywood, right, and Kumi Walker own MR., a barbershop and wine bar in San Francisco, California.\nThis is not your typical barbershop.\nAnd that has always been the vision of owners Kumi Walker and Sean Heywood.\n\"We are literally trying to create a new version of the country club golf experience. But we're replacing golf with haircuts, and we're putting it in urban environments,\" says Heywood.\nMR. (for mister) is their first business venture. It's an upscale barbershop, wine bar and lounge in the financial district of San Francisco where memberships cost $65 to $250 a month. In addition to the basic services, those who become members benefit from exclusive services like golf putting clinics and human resource workshops.\n\"We're trying to thrive, not just survive,\" Heywood said.\nMR. takes the cultural aspect of the black barbershop experience and modernizes it, making it a place where businesspeople of all races can network.\nThe two entrepreneurs are bridging a cultural divide, and also giving back to the community. They offer free lifetime memberships to MR. to those in good standing with a re-entry program called Back on Track.\nAmong other things, Back on Track offers first-time, low-level criminal offenders GED preparation, tutoring, money-management instruction and job training and placement. And that's where MR. steps in. The membership provides them with one free haircut, trim, and shoeshine monthly.\n\"We'll take care of their grooming so that they don't have to. And they're ready for all the different jobs that they pursue going forward,\" Walker says.\nGiving back is paramount for the entrepreneurs. And the story of one black business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, inspires them. It was known as Black Wall Street, and it was destroyed in a race riot and fire 88 years ago.\n\"All of the businesses that we wanted to create, we wanted to encompass the culture of, if that community still existed today, what it would look like,\" says Walker, who says he read about the riot six years ago.\nImagine a credit union, a barbershop, a library, and men in freshly pressed suits with top hats sauntering on sidewalks. The melodic sounds of jazz flow into the streets from several nightclubs. A thriving community of black-owned businesses serve their clientele across a 42-block area.\nThat was the community that existed in the segregated neighborhood of Greenwood from 1830 to 1921.\nBut on the evening of May 31, 1921, white mobs entered Greenwood with torches and guns. Black residents gathered to protect a young man accused of assaulting a white woman. When the smoke from fires cleared on June 1, more than 1,000 homes, businesses and other institutions were burned or destroyed, according to the report of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.\nSound off: What challenges do black entrepreneurs face?\niReport.com: How would you make black America better?\n\"People came and said, 'Run, they are shooting people,' \" says Wess Young, who was 4 then. \"We evacuated. They were destroying everything.\"\nThe death toll has been debated for years, because many victims were dumped in mass graves. An American Red Cross estimate puts the total at 300, much higher than the 36 reported by local officials.\nThe riot devastated the social underpinnings of the Greenwood community and leveled a black economic force. Greenwood was rebuilt, but it never recovered.\n\"It was a really tragic end to thriving businesses. I think we'd be a lot further ahead had that area been able to continue to thrive,\" says Walker.\nWess Young and his family rebuilt their lives in Tulsa. When asked what he thought America would be like if the Tulsa race riot had not happened, he answers without hesitation, \"We would have had a black president before now. ... He has done a good job, but we [blacks are] still in a box.\"\nHis advice to people is to let go of the past once they've learned from it.\n\"Hate will destroy your whole universe -- got to learn how to forgive, but never forget,\" Young says.\nWalker says these stories of black struggle and survival motivate him.\n\"I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors,\" he says. \"I just want to be as successful as possible so I can turn around and be mentors and sponsors to other people who come after me.\"", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T10:46:09Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/07/24/bia.black.entrepreneurs/index.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

We love you!\nA very Merry Christmas from our house to yours.\nThe Maslyn Mrs. is not know for her love of cooking or cleaning, but one recipe she thinks every cook should know is this brunch family favorite. She though you might like to have it for Christmas morning! It is not low-fat, but hey, it\u2019s a holiday.\nCut up bread in cubes & spread in 1/2 in greased casserole dish.\nMix the rest of the ingredients together & pour over bread.\nUse a flat spatula to press down bread so it is fully saturated.\nCover with plastic wrap & let it sit in the fridge over night.\nCook all ingredients except the butter for 2 minutes in a small saucepan on the stove until it is bubbly.\nRemove from stove & stir in butter.\nPour over baked strata right before you serve it.\nWe wish for you a working oven all holiday season long, but if you do happen to need an oven repair, call Maslyn & Sons Appliance and we will be there to help so you can make this tasty recipe for your family. (And remember not to clean your oven right before a big holiday as that is the #1 time ovens tend to go out.\nTo keep the oven, garbage disposal and kitchen sink drain in good working condition this holiday season, take some precautions. Oven problems usually go unnoticed until the big meal is already inside the oven, so a few minutes spent checking your kitchen appliances could save your holiday season.\nAlso, as we mentioned at Thanksgiving, avoid running the self-cleaning cycle RIGHT before a big holiday dinner (because this might cause something to go wrong with your oven\u2026 do it WELL in advance so if something breaks, you have plenty of time to call Maslyn & Sons Appliance out).\nReplace gaskets at the first sign of a leak or if moisture appears on outside of oven.\nAvoid pouring grease down your drain into your garbage disposal.\nThrow leftovers in the trash or compost pile instead of putting down the garbage disposal.\nEnsure there is enough space around appliances to allow heat to escape.\nSo pleased to welcome a new \u201cdaughter-in-love\u201d to our family!\n*Replace charcoal filter on your VENT HOOD (1x every 12 months).\n*Swap out rubber drain hoses for braided stainless steel on your WASHER to prevent floods and leaks.\nMaslyn & Sons Appliance repair does appliance maintenance as well as appliance repair!\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees.

It\u2019s like we didn\u2019t even TRY to come up with a tradition. The tradition is, we overeat.\nGet your microwave squeaky clean before you have guests for the holiday. It will work better AND be less embarrassing!\nFill a microwave-safe glass or bowl half full of water. Add a tablespoon of white vinegar.\nTurn on for 5 minutes. You may need less time in a high-powered microwave oven; keep an eye on it the first time you try this.

Wipe down the inside of the microwave with a clean rag or paper towel while it is still steamy and the gunk is still softened.\nThe loose gunk should come off easily now.\nTake out the glass tray or turntable and wash it like a dish. You could even run it through the dishwasher if you have time.\nWe hope your appliances stay in tip-top working order as you enter this busy holiday season, but if they don\u2019t, call Maslyn and Sons Appliance and we will come out and do your microwave repair in a jiffy!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T18:28:55Z", "url": "http://www.maslynandsons.com/author/admin/page/3/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Additionally, due to low earnings, fast food workers\u2019 families also receive an annual average of $1.04 billion in food stamp benefits and $1.91 billion in Earned Income Tax Credit payments.\nThe ten largest fast-food companies alone made more than $7.4 billion in profits in 2012 and paid their top executives more than $53 million in compensation.\nLow-wage fast-food jobs cost tax-payers the most in California ($717 million), New York ($708 million), Texas ($556 million), Illinois ($368 million), and Florida ($348 million).\nAccording to Super Sizing Public Costs, \u201cMcDonald\u2019s represents the most costly fast-food company for tax-payers.\u201d Low wages and lack of benefits at McDonald\u2019s cost tax-payers \u201c$1.2 billion every year in public assistance programs,\u201d according to the report.\nYUM!

Furthermore, 67 percent of front-line fast-food workers are adults 20 and older; 68 percent are the main earners in their families and more than one-quarter are raising children.\n\u201cThis business model puts tax-payers on the hook, while rewarding corporate CEO\u2019s,\u201d Jack Temple, a policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project and co-author of Super Sizing Public Costs, said during a conference call with the press on October 15.\nThe reports come on the heels of a nation-wide wave of fast-food worker strikes; most recently strikes took place in over 60 cities across the nation with thousands of fast-food workers walking off their jobs.\n\u201cThe CEO of McDonald\u2019s makes more in a day than I make in a year,\u201d Yates added.\nFast-food workers nationally are calling for $15 an-hour in pay and the right to form or join a union without retaliation.\nJacobs also addressed the wave of non-traditional worker organizing taking place in fast-food, retail and other low-wage service sector jobs.\nSuper Sizing Public Costs: How Low Wages at Top Fast-Food Chains Leave Taxpayers Footing the Bill was published by the National Employment Law Project and Fast Food, Poverty Wages: The Public Cost of Low-Wage Jobs in the Fast-Food Industry was published by the University of California Labor Center.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T06:11:53Z", "url": "https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/fast-food-giants-cost-america-7-bil-in-mctaxes/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

This would work beautifully for any family feast or romantic, intimate dinner.\n1. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Cut the squash in half through the stem and lay the halves cut side down on the oiled baking sheet. Bake 50-60 minutes, until easily pierced with a knife. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Scoop out seeds and fibers and discard, then spoon the flesh into a mixing bowl. Mash squash with a potato-masher until smooth, then add breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, honey, thyme, rosemary, chopped sage, and orange zest. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.\n2. Warm the olive oil and nut oil over medium heat in a small frying pan and add hazelnuts or walnuts. Cook, stirring often, about 3 minutes, or until nuts are golden. Transfer nuts to a plate and set aside.\n3. Melt butter in a medium saucepan until it turns brown and begins to smoke, 3-4 minutes. Remove immediately from heat, add nutmeg, and set aside.\n4. Place a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Spoon mounds of filling on the sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart (the number of mounds you make will depend on the size of the pasta sheets you use). Lightly mist the mounds with a spray mister filled with water, then place a second pasta sheet over the first, covering the filling mounds, and pressing firmly around the edges and between the mounds to seal. Using a fluted cutting wheel or knife, cut between the rows of ravioli. Repeat with remaining sheets of pasta and filling.\n5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli and cook until tender, 2-3 minutes. To serve, reheat the browned butter. Drain ravioli and place in warmed serving bowl. Toss with butter, sprinkle with hazelnuts and 1/4 cup Parmesan. Garnish with sage leaves and serve immediately.\nInspired by Williams-Sonoma Seasonal Celebration: Autumn, by Joanne Weir (Time-Life Books, 1997).", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T16:23:53Z", "url": "https://www.care2.com/greenliving/butternut-ravioli-parmesan-hazelnuts.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "How Do You Remove Calcium From Your Swimming Pool?\nIf you have a swimming pool in the Las Vegas area you are going to have to remove calcium from it. Even though calcium is great for strong bones and teeth, the same can\u2019t be said about your swimming pool. If you live in our area you should be familiar with the fact that our fill water is loaded with calcium and other hardness minerals which can destroy numerous different things in your household. Over time, calcium scales your decorative faucets, plugs up shower heads and causes stains/water spots on the sinks and surfaces of your house. It can be extremely difficult to get rid of and ultimately extremely expensive when you need to replace them around your house. But, with all that said, have you thought about what this calcium will do to your swimming pool?\nIn the southwest, our water comes from the Colorado River which winds its way through the Grand Canyon. This area is loaded with calcium, magnesium and any other hardness minerals (limestone) you can think of which means that over time you will have to deal with hard water in your swimming pool too. As you fill your swimming pool with this hard water (typically 400 parts per million and higher) it will build up in concentration. Please note, as water evaporates the hardness minerals remain in solution and increase in concentration. When this happens, the scale will come visible on the tile, interior finish of the pool and filtration equipment. As the calcium continues to plate itself on the surfaces of the swimming pool it will inevitably cause more and more damages, not to mention, destroys the lifespan of your investment. That\u2019s why at Clark County Pool & Lawn we recommend changing out the water in your swimming pool every two years!\nBy using our filtration it is a service that can be performed 365 days a year because the interior finish of the swimming pool isn\u2019t exposed. In fact, you can even swim in the pool during filtration. What you and your family are left with is drinking quality water which is extremely safe to swim in. With all the issues of water quality in the news wouldn\u2019t you prefer to swim in a pool that won\u2019t make your eyes red or your skin itch?

{"text": "The RAW is a generic photography term that relates to one of two file types that is output from your camera, the other being JPEG. It\u2019s always written in capitals, although it doesn\u2019t actually stand for anything. Canon\u2019s RAW file format is known as CR2.\nSo why would you shoot in RAW, as opposed to JPEG?\nWith JPEG images, your camera takes the shot, applies certain settings, compresses it, then saves it. With RAW images, the photo retains almost all of the original data from the sensor. This gives the photographer the flexibility to finely tweak settings such as noise reduction, sharpness, white balance etc., before saving the final image as a JPEG. Most commonly, this is done on a computer using a program such as Adobe Lightroom, or Canon Digital Photo Professional.\nWhile it does provide the perfect platform for post production, shooting in RAW means that you will fill up your card quicker, because the file sizes are generally 5 times larger. It also requires you to spend time \u2018developing\u2019 the images before they can be shared.\nSee JPEG for more information.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T22:00:17Z", "url": "https://www.canon.com.au/explore/glossary/raw", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Now it remembers staying in absolute mode and I can safely shutdown Windows (XP SP1) without getting the trackir drivers stuck. Simply amazing!!!\nI've used it for 3 years now in sims. Still works as new.\nSoftware has been constantly improved and it gets better and better all the time.\nThe longer you have it the more you like it, I hated it at first but now I wont fly without it.\nYou just have to learn to use it,for example always sit the same distance from the Tir unit or the responce will vary greatly.And use lots of deadzone at first then slowly reduce it as your skills improve.\nBrought the 3D into flightsimming, that's for sure. Now I can look at my instruments, out the window, through my body by turning my head.\nIt's not like in real life, but it gets closer..\nI still use it from time to time.\nI find it of less value/use on non-full real.\nWhen I have the 'pit off or external views I find it disorienting, but that may be down to practice!\nAnd as I am having a major problem adjusting to the new FM's I don't have the time or patience to put into TIR in these circumstances!\nAnd the orientation is automatic because you always have feedback where you look, because you move your head in that direction. But if you're not used to it, it may take a bit of practice. It's not hard though.\nSo when i fly pit off, i only fly with just the gunsight as visual reference and never lose orientation. TrackIR is handy with all settings, medium easy or hard. It's just like using a joystick to fly when for years you've been using the arrow keys to fly. TrackIR is also the HOTAS (= hands OFF throttle and stick) to look around.\nSometimes i watch trk's in external view and recreate external padlock with the trackIR. Focusing on 1 plane while tracking the other(s) with it. You can do that all without pressing buttons. It's great. So people who think trackIR is only usefull in full real games haven't yet discovered the full capability of trackIR yet./i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif Because it's even better in medium or easy games.\nIt's getting better and better! No flying without it as far as I'm concerned.\nNew software (2.11) supports it in FS2004 as well. Go get it!\nI better stop being lazy and negotiate with my wife for some extra 'stick time'!\nYou can also look at the map while looking around the countryside to orient yourself looking for landmarks, rivers towns etc. And if you want, you can steer the view independantly of the gun if you want to play reargunner. In short, it was already good back then, it's great now, and it's getting better all the time.\nNew software/drivers is good too!\nCan't wait to fire it up again when I get home tonight!\n\"Sorry kids, Daddy is busy\"\nWhat is the price for TrackIr?\nIs it available in skandinavia?\nDNMY made a comment about the map and he(she?) was dead on.

Age-and gender adjusted IRR of long-term injury (\u226590 days) for night versus day shifts was IRR 3.12, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.35\u20137.21 and IRR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04\u20134.68, for night versus afternoon shifts. Among all durations examined, the largest IRR was for injury \u226590 days, night versus day shifts (IRR 3.12, 95% CI 1.35\u20137.21).\nNight shift work was significantly associated with long-term injury among police officers after adjustment for age and gender. Although type of injury was not available, it is possible that variation in injury type across shifts might account for some of this association.\nJ Occup Environ Med. 59(11):1084-1088.\nJ Occup Environ Med. 58(3):e66-e71.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T04:32:08Z", "url": "https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/32051", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "see my previous post on the topic, #1.\nMy last post ended up more as a how-to than what-to. This time, I\u2019ll say why you should have local copies of the documentation for most of the tools you use. I\u2019ll also tell you the sort of things I always have handy as well.\nGetting a local copy of php.net \u2013 and getting installed as an apache vhost and updated (probably weekly) is some effort, but well worth it. I\u2019ve said it before, but PHP.net is the best language reference site that I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s kept up to date (sometimes ahead of the code releases in fact) and while the notes that are added to it can sometimes confuse, as much as help, when they do help, they will really make the difference.\nI don\u2019t tend to buy many PHP books, because what can they do besides re-iterate what is is already there?\nThe most important thing to bear in mind though is not to just have the documentation there to read \u2013 you have to know what is available. Projects like PHP, the Zend Framework and PHPUnit have a lot of parts \u2013 and knowing that they have things \u2013 even if you don\u2019t know how they work right now, can save you days or weeks of effort.\nIt\u2019s for that reason that you need to at least scan over all the the docs you have \u2013 and indeed for all the libraries and tools that you use. Even I don\u2019t read everything and expect to remember it all \u2013 but I remember enough to recognise that a paticular tool might have something to help \u2013 maybe PHP has something to search the values in an array (http://php.net/array-search), or can use Oracle, or Ldap, or Memcached, or that Zend Framework can let you easily loop over maildirs (or an mbox) to get each mail from within it. If you don\u2019t read the manual \u2013 at least skimming over it, you would never know that functionality exists, and you inevitably end up reimplementing other people\u2019s already debugged code. That\u2019s a waste of your time.\nSo, take an hour now, and assemble a directory to put these docs into, and read through them \u2013 not everything, but at least look at headers of every section, just to get an idea of what is available and maybe go back and read up some more on things that may be useful to you. If something isn\u2019t so interesting to you now, do bear in mind, your next project, or job, might change that.\nAbove all, keep learning. Never stop.\nI generally just download the latest many-HTML-page tar.bz2 file from http://pear.php.net/manual/ and drop it into my docs directory.\nFor ZF, there\u2019s two sets of documentation \u2013 the main docs, and the generated API. Also, since they are released as versions, with the code, rather than continually upgraded. Downloading and unpacking both styles of documentation is easy, and then I\u2019ll just add a quick index.html file in the base to quickly bounce into either the manual, or API.\nSimpletest is easy, copy the documentation from the source tar-ball. While the team that develops it is getting quickly obsoleted by PHP Unit, they are still ahead on mocking and web-form testing. There are also some ideas somewhat buried in the online docs for upcoming features.\nFor updating the phpunit docs, I\u2019ve taken to checking out a copy of the docs and running the build script to get the HTML, and then like ZF, having a redirect [in this case, a header(\u2018Location: \u2026\u2019)] to bounce the browser into the right place to start reading. An Apache alias or just an easy link from the top level into the generated docs are other trivial ways to do that.\nhttp://svnbook.red-bean.com/ and of course, they have the book sources in subversion Probably as easy to just download the multi-file tarball occasionally.\nAlthough TortoiseSvn, and other tools like it make the every day check-ins and updates easy, I know I\u2019ll still hit the manual for branching for a while yet.\nYou thought you were going to get away without a reminder to write your own documentation? Wrong!\nphpXref \u2013 A bit of an old-timer, it\u2019s actually written in perl, but it will link parts of your code around a large number of HTML pages \u2013 useful for code exploration.\nThe Pear PHP_DocBlockGenerator is also useful to generate the place-holders in a newly written file that might be a little light on function docblocks, though it does tend to go a little overboard with variables. If there are docblocks \u2013 even empty ones, it won\u2019t change them, but it will add function parameter names for you to go back and explain what they are, and why they are there.\nOne little optimisation I\u2019ve done with a project I\u2019m working on is that since the site is some 45MB \u2013 most of that pure PHP (library) code, I don\u2019t bother running the document generation unless a PHP file has changed.\nI hope those help, but remember \u2013 you have to know where to look for help \u2013 so read!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T14:58:48Z", "url": "https://phpscaling.com/2008/03/24/always-have-up-to-date-documentation-part-2/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Phew! Do you feel like an emotional husk after yesterday's big wave carnage and confounded trying to keep up with a blast of events happening at the same time? Spike summarises for us.\nWhat a crazy day of surfing, and its been and will be happening today, again, at the business end of the surfing and SUP season. Stephanie Gilmore just won the women's WSL Championship Tour after surfing in one heat but the clincher for her was when main challenger Lakey Peterson was eliminated from the Beachwaver Maui Pro in cranking 8 foot surf.\nThen, Keana Kennelly won the women's BWT last night by trying to commit hara kiri on waves already bordering on tow only. The same went for the men afterwards. Even they were in way over their heads, so to speak. Did you know they called off the men's event not because they thought it too dangerous (at first) but because they literally 'lost' Russel Bierke at Jaws last night? For me, the red light was already flashing like a strobe light watching the women's suicidal commitment.\nGut wrenching stuff! Then we had to watch the same trait to end life as we know it by the men. Was that barrel that Twiggy planed into - a hair's breath away from another flotation vest-ripping, bone-snapping over the falls death dance - the biggest barrel paddled into in the history of .... like everything?\nIt was insane. Well, we have more of the same tonight. Tighten your britches bru, stomach in, chest out! Try stock up on adrenaline after it was sucked dry last night.\nToday is a busy day in the water world of waves and SUP. The Vans World Cup is on at Sunset beach and Jordy Smith joins six other Saffas in the lineup (and seven if you count Benji Brand), with Jordy winning his Round 1 heat and leapfrogging Round 2 direct to Round 3. Dylan Lightfoot, Mikey February, Adin Masencamp, Matthew McGillivray, Beyrick De Vries, and David van Zyl are all through to four-man Round 2 heats with the top two joining the top two who went direct to Round 3. Oh, and Sunset is fire ing.\nThe ISA World SUP and Paddleboard Champs just wound down the day in China, with the SUP Surfing done after Riyue Bay was fed by waves from a typhoon. Sadly, despite a good show, Thomas King dropped out in Repecharge Heat 7, two heats from the final. But he's into the Men's technical race repercharge, as is Kimon dos Santos, which is one heat from the final. Tarryn King has made the women's final main event of Technical Racing, with Tamsyn Foster into the repecharge.\nThen there's the Taiwan Open World Longboarding Champs running in a parallel time zone in Taiwan. Four Saffas are there. Steezy Sawyer (24) of Jeffreys Bay, Sam Christianson (20) Alfonzo Pieters (29) and Chrystal Hulett (22). Matthew Moir had a wildcard entry, but apparently has too much work going on, and couldn't attend.\nEven without Mouse, this is the most experienced group to attend a WSL Longboard Championships. Steezy Sawyer, despite breaking his board and taking a sip of piss in a bizarre bit of miscommunication, is through to Round 3 and is a big favourite. Muizenberg local Pieters was knocked out in Round 2, but Christianson prevailed in the last heat of the day a short while ago (11am SA time). Hulett is up early tomorrow.\nJinsun Harbour has had lank swell, and the longboarders are ripping. In a first for the WSL, world champions from two separate disciplines will be crowned at the same venue when the WSL Junior Surfing Championships follow the longboarding from 1-9 December.\n\"Round 2\" of the big wave surfing at Jaws (and conditions look just as hairy, though hopefully a little more benign) will be called at around 7pm this evening SA time.\nYou'll be spoiled for choice, with the Vans Triple Crown event at Sunset also set to kickstart this evening around the same time, or a bit later. PLUS we have the women's Beachwaver Maui Pro continuing too, and the surf as you know is GOING OFF in Hawaii.\nBy the way, amidst the women's CT world title excitement, spare a thought for Ventura native Sage Erickson, who was on the opposite end of the spectrum shored up by Gilmore's elation. Like Lakey, she was eliminated in Round 2 by Nikki Van Dijk, which means she fails to requalify for 2019. She also narrowly misses requalifying via the QS by one heat at the Port Stephens Toyota Pro earlier this month.\nAnyway, get the AV going, and get ready to bounce around to different events like a crazy person.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T22:34:21Z", "url": "https://www.wavescape.co.za/surf-news/breaking-news/surfing-world-explodes.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "The following blog post is sponsored by DressFirst.com.\nMy best friend from college was married 18 years ago this week. As her maid of honor, I felt like a princess. We has our hair and nails done, rode in a limousine to the reception while New Orleans police officers stopped traffic just for the wedding party, and then we all danced under twinkling Christmas lights. The other bridesmaids and I wore gorgeous emerald green dresses with a long satin bow in the back. Maybe because it was a Christmastime wedding, the dress was packed away with my Christmas decorations. It no longer fits, but I look at it every year as my children and I unpack ornaments. This year my daughter asked to try it on. The girls are both still teenagers and smaller than I was in my 20s, and it was too long for both of them still.\nThey have both been in a wedding, and part of the excitement was helping them to find just the right dresses. If I had known of DressFirst.com then, finding them may have been easier. DressFirst.com is an online site selling wedding dresses, prom dresses, evening dresses, holiday dresses, homecoming dresses, etc. They have a large selection of both jr bridesmaid dresses and bridesmaid dresses.\nActually, almost everything needed for a wedding can be ordered from this one website. From lovely floral bouquets to napkins and serving sets for the wedding cake and even invitations. Arranging a wedding with online conveniences is so much different than when I went to multiple businesses as I planned my own wedding. The lovely Romantic Round Satin Wedding Bouquet is the same soft peach color my own wedding roses were.\nIn addition to everything needed for weddings, DressFirst.com also offers dresses for other special occasions as well as shoes for any dressy occasion. The ballroom selection may have just what we need for the next time we go English Country Dancing.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored blog post by Dress First.

What a special time to remember a friend, a wedding, a change, and sharing that with your family.\nThanks for the info - always looking for good dress sources!\nCannot wait to check this site out!\nLooks like a great site, thank you so much!\nI definitely need to check this one out for a dress for the Azalea Ball.

Your natural teeth have their own colour, which the dentists will use as reference so the dental restorations do not look out of place in the mouth.

{"text": "Notice: This is an old thread. The last post was 2737 days ago. If your post is not directly related to this discussion please consider making a new thread.\nEvery researcher or diagnostician working with reptiles has faced the challenge of identifying reptile hemoparasites and then determining whether they are of importance or merely incidental. Another challenge is how to easily find the information required to make the proper identification. A distillation of knowledge from world-renowned expert Sam R. Telford, Jr, Hemoparasites of the Reptilia: Color Atlas and Text provides a comprehensive compilation of information on how to differentiate between the myriad species of reptile hemoparasites.\nThe atlas provides diagnoses for 262 species of plasmodiids, hemogregarines, hemococcidians, trypansosomes, and leishmanias, including descriptions of eight new species or new taxonomic designations. It also discusses lesser known groups, such as piroplasms, rickettsiae, chlamydia, and erythrocytic viruses. Each genus and many species are represented among the 166 taxa illustrated in color. The species accounts contain host and geographic distribution, with precise localities when possible, prevalence, life cycles and vectors when known, effects upon the host, and ecology of the host-parasite relationship, morphological variation, and an exhaustive bibliography. The book also includes an illustrated key showing diagnostic characters.\nTelford draws on his 45 years of experience and his personal collection, considered the world\u2019s most complete, to provide information on the morphology of the unicellular parasites of reptilian blood. He includes information from hard-to-find original papers and articles from sources throughout the world. The illustrated key and photomicrographs from Telford\u2019s collection make identifying species quicker and easier.\nLast edited by Motoko; 6th September 2012 at 07:09 PM.

{"text": "The giant 700 MW project in Dubai will combine tower and trough technologies and use scale and local infrastructure synergies to set a new benchmark price of $73/MWh for CSP with storage, Andrea Lovato, ACWA Power\u2019s Executive Director of Business Development, told New Energy Update.\nACWA Power will use learnings from its Noor CSP project in Morocco which also uses tower and trough technology.\nOn September 16, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) awarded Saudi Arabia\u2019s ACWA Power a 700 MW CSP project following a highly competitive tender launched earlier this year.\nACWA Power\u2019s plant is expected to cost AED14.2 billion ($3.9 billion) and ACWA Power is to commit $750 million equity to the project. Consortium partners will include China\u2019s Shanghai Electric and DEWA has also said it plans to invest in the plant.\nThe project represents the world\u2019s largest single-site CSP plant based on the Independent Power Producer (IPP) model and will use a combination of central tower and parabolic trough technologies.\nACWA Power\u2019s 700 MW project is far larger than the 200 MW requirement set out in DEWA\u2019s tender criteria and establishes new cost benchmarks for the growing Middle East CSP market.\n\u201cOpex [Operational expenditure] savings can also be achieved using common infrastructure and operations and maintenance personnel in the UAE,\u201d he said.\nACWA Power\u2019s tower system will provide fifteen hours of storage while the trough section will provide eleven hours. The combination of technologies will help to reduce the total cost of energy, Lovato said.\n\u201cParabolic troughs are a more mature and low-risk technology while tower technology and energy storage help reduce costs,\u201d he said.\n\u201cUse of this [combination of] technology has allowed for increased storage capacity,\u201d Lovato noted.\nDEWA\u2019s tender criteria did not enforce local content requirements and Shanghai Electric\u2019s involvement in the engineering, procurement and construction of the project will help drive down costs.\nShanghai Electric is currently building CSP capacity in China as part of the country\u2019s ambitious targets to complete 20 CSP projects of total capacity 1.3 GW by 2018. This first batch of Chinese projects is expected to accelerate deployment efficiencies and build out China\u2019s CSP supply chain.\n\u201cIn order to deliver reliable power at the lowest possible cost, ACWA Power looks to incorporate local content where possible, as well as work with our existing network of suppliers in the markets where we operate to achieve economies of scale and reduce cost,\u201d Lovato said.\nACWA Power also expects savings in financing costs due to DEWA\u2019s strong credit rating, the political stability of UAE, and the current low interest rate environment.\nIn 2016, Dubai set the world\u2019s lowest PV price of $29.9/MWh for the 800 MW MBR phase 2 project, demonstrating the significant banking interest and cost reduction potential of Dubai\u2019s solar program.\nACWA Power\u2019s equity investment in the 700 MW project represents the company\u2019s largest ever capital commitment.\nThe power purchase agreement (PPA) and financial closure of the project are expected to be finished \u201cshortly,\u201d DEWA said in a statement.\nEarlier this year, Saudi Arabia\u2019s newly-created Renewable Energy Project Development Office (REPDO) said it plans to build 1 GW of CSP capacity by 2023.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T20:43:56Z", "url": "http://www.solarpaces.org/acwa-bid-record-low-cost-csp-dubai/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Ever looked at a woman with gorgeous hair and wondered what type of hair care products she uses? If so, then trust us when we say that we\u2019ve all been there. Everyone at some point or the other in their lives has come across women with stunning hair and wondered what they do every day to keep their hair healthy, great-looking and free of unsightly problems like dandruff and hair thinning.\nNowadays, women are troubled with various hair concerns that make their precious locks look dull and lifeless. They often go to great lengths, from pricey salon sessions to trying professional hair care products, to restore natural beauty to their mane. However, instead of splurging money on these things, you could just try doing simple-yet-powerful things to improve the texture and appearance of your locks.\nOne thing that every woman with great hair can vouch for is the importance of using gentle hair care products. There are a plethora of hair care products available in the beauty stores these days. However, not all of them benefit your hair. In fact, there are tons of hair care products that contain harsh chemicals capable of doing more harm than good to your hair. Using harsh hair care products can strip your hair of its natural oil and leave it looking dry and dull. Whether it is a hair serum or your everyday shampoo and conditioner, it is imperative to buy products that are gentle and do not contain harsh compounds.\nHeat-styling tools like straighteners and curling irons are true favorites for hair styling purposes. There is no denying the fact that using these tools can leave your hair looking well-styled and pretty. However, over-using these tools can cause severe damage to the texture of your hair can make them become rough and frizzy. The heat from these tools adversely affects the hair follicles on your scalp and leads to various unsightly problems. To prevent that from happening, it is important to avoid using heat-styling tools every day. Most women who have naturally gorgeous hair stay away from heat-styling tools. While using them every once in a while is not that harmful, daily use of these tools is a complete no-no for maintaining the health and beauty of hair.\nWomen with great hair are aware of the ways in which exposure to the sun can damage their hair. The UVA and UVB rays emitted by the sun are not just bad for your skin but they are equally harmful to your hair. Experts have found that prolonged exposure can cause the hair to appear dry and rough and lead to premature greying of hair. To safeguard your hair from the damaging effects of the sun, try to cover up your hair with a scarf while out in the sun and use sun-protective hair care products.\nWomen who have beautiful hair use wide-tooth wooden combs. There are plenty of ways in which switching your regular plastic combs with a wooden comb can benefit your hair. Brushing the hair with a wooden comb stimulates blood circulation in the scalp and encourages hair growth. It also nourishes your hair and prevents flyaways. When compared to plastic and metal combs, wooden combs do not cause breakage and prevent hair from becoming frizzy.\nAnother thing that is common among women with stunning hair is the habit of sleeping on a satin pillowcase. This simple everyday habits can transform the way you\u2019re your hair looks. The softness of satin prevents the development of friction in the hair. Sleeping on a satin pillowcase can help you wake up with soft, smooth and frizz-free locks.\nAnother thing that women with great hair do every day is to keep their mane clean. It is a commonly known fact that keeping hair and scalp clean is essential for its health and appearance. By doing so, you will be able to ward off residue-buildup in the scalp that further leads to a wide range of issues like dandruff, hair loss and itchy scalp. On a daily basis, your hair gets exposed to the toxic elements in the air along with dust and dirt. These substances settle in your scalp and if not cleaned in due time, they can lead to various troubling hair problems. To avoid that from happening, follow what women with enviable hair do and keep your locks clean.\nInstead of using heat-styling tools, women with great hair use styling products like hair serums to beautify and add shine to their tresses. Just a dollop of a hair serum can leave your hair looking well-styled, shiny and smooth. There are plenty of hair serums available in the stores. Pick a hair serum that is especially developed for your hair type, whether oily or dry and use it to style your hair. Do this every day to flaunt picture-perfect mane.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T11:49:11Z", "url": "https://riodelrey.com/7-things-women-with-great-hair-do-every-day/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The model has traction tires and is driven on four wheelsets by two ball bearing B\u00fchler motors. It has an mfx/DCC sound decoder with many sound and light functions. The pantographs can be raised and lowered digitally on both end cars. All the cars on the train have metal wheels, and the center car has wheelsets with ball bearings. All the doors can be opened.

The new train is not only highly modern, but it also conceals significant innovations and a lot of power inside. All the wheelsets are powered in both end cars.

With 8 powered wheelsets and its performance, the \"ALLEGRA\" develops a correspondingly high tractive effort of 260 kilo newton / 58,450 pound-force, which exceeds that of the Ge 4/4 III by 30%. With it, the builder Stadler succeeded in creating a unique meter gauge powered rail car train in the entire world in terms of power density, performance, and weight. One special challenge here was to \"stow\" the power packets in the limited space beneath the powered rail car floor and on the roof, which also succeeded thanks to innovative solutions. The non-powered intermediate car offers comfortable entry with its depressed floor area, a handicap-accessible toilet, and storage space for baby strollers. There is space in the class ABe 8/12 with its fully air conditioned passenger areas for 24 seats in 1st class and 76 seats in 2nd class as well as additional fold-down seats and standing room. A modern passenger information system with flat screens is also standard. The ends of the powered rail car trains with the Grisons canton coat-of-arms lends the lower part of the cab with its shape coming to a point and the straight cab windows arching to the back a certain sharp edged look and it also symbolizes its power. The \"ALLEGRA\" can also claim a speed record for meter gauge trains because on December 20, 2010 unit 3502 reached a proud 145 km/h / 91 mph on a special run in the Vereina Tunnel.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T12:06:47Z", "url": "https://www.lgb.com/products/details/article/22225/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "According to one narrative, the Timberwolves decided after Friday\u2019s loss to the Kings to trade Jimmy Butler.\nBut he might have forced their hand, resulting in his trade to the 76ers.\nButler decided he would play on Friday night, but he viewed it as the fork in the road. If the Timberwolves didn\u2019t find a deal to fulfill his long-simmering trade request after that, he would begin to sit indefinitely, league sources told The Athletic.\nThe Kings defeated Minnesota 121-110 to push the Timberwolves to 4-9 and a winless road trip; Butler had 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in 41 minutes. He had played almost 124 minutes in the last three games, all losses, and at halftime of the final one, the Wolves were informed that this was it for Butler, sources said.\nButler reportedly held out for a game a couple weeks ago, though he and Minnesota both denied it. It\u2019s quite believable he would\u2019ve held out again if not traded. Still, informing the team during a game he\u2019s playing would have been quite bold.\nI\u2019m not sure who actually blinked first. This could be an I-quit, no-you\u2019re-fired (or vice versa) scenario.

{"text": "It may not have been enough to bring out the skis, but Wood River Valley residents woke up with a shock Wednesday to see a snowstorm three days before the start of summer.\nElizabeth Padian, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Pocatello, said observers reported snow from Timmerman Hill north through the Wood River and Sawtooth valleys.\nPadian said late-June snowstorms are a rarity in the area, but historical records show that a trace of snow is possible on any given day year-round. She said that since the start of record-keeping in 1937, there has been snowfall in the Wood River Valley on several days in late June, as well as in July and August.\nJan Turzian, owner of Sun Valley Garden Center in Bellevue, said a few of her customers told her they lost tomatoes due to the unexpected cold weather.

{"text": "There were 13,328,066 shares of the Registrant\u2019s Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on July 31, 2016.\nThe consolidated balance sheet of Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) at September 30, 2015 was derived from the Company\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements at that date. The consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2016 and the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows were made. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for a full year or of future operations.\nCertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America were omitted pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company\u2019s fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\nCertain amounts previously presented in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company elected to early adopt Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2015-17-Income Taxes (Topic 740) requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The purpose of this adoption was to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The accompanying balance sheet as of September 30, 2015 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of this standard. The effect of the adjustment at September 30, 2015 was a $6.4 million decrease in current assets, a $10,000 decrease in current liabilities, a $3.0 million increase in non-current deferred tax assets and a $3.4 million decrease in non-current deferred tax liabilities. Such reclassification had no effect on our previously reported net loss, stockholders\u2019 equity or cash flows.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. The Company continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debt reserves, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves, product warranty reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and deferred income tax assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities which are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions.\nThe Company\u2019s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying value of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. At June 30, 2016, management reviewed the recoverability of the carrying value of the Company\u2019s long-lived assets based on future undiscounted cash flows and determined that the carrying value of certain rental assets exceeded the expected future cash flows. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.0 million in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016. No such impairment of remaining long-lived assets was necessary as the expected future cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the assets.\nThe Company primarily derives revenue from the sale of its manufactured products, including revenue derived from the sale of its manufactured rental equipment. In addition, the Company generates revenue from the short-term rental under operating leases of its manufactured products. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales, including the sale of used rental equipment, when (i) title passes to the customer, (ii) the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership, (iii) the product sales price has been determined, (iv) collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, and (v) product delivery occurs as directed by the customer. Except for certain of the Company\u2019s reservoir characterization products, the Company\u2019s products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions and the Company\u2019s standard terms of sale do not allow customers to return products for credit. The Company recognizes rental revenue as earned over the rental period. Rentals of the Company\u2019s equipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to six months or longer. Revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are rendered over the duration of a project, or as billed on a per hour basis. Field service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate.\nimmediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption for fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted. Entities will apply the standard\u2019s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify key components of employee share-based payment accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expense and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, this new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The guidance also requires disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied using the modified retrospective approach. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and should be applied retrospectively, with early application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures in certain circumstances. The new guidance was issued to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to recognize revenue from contracts with customers by applying a five-step model in accordance with the core principle to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, this guidance specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the effective date of this guidance to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. Entities have the option to adopt this guidance either retrospectively or through a modified retrospective transition method. This new standard will supersede existing revenue guidance and affect the Company's revenue recognition process and the presentations or disclosures of the Company's consolidated financial statements and footnotes. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nAt June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company\u2019s Canadian subsidiary had $27.5 million and $28.1 million, respectively, of Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable owed to one of the Company\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries. In order to mitigate its exposure to movements in foreign currency rates between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, the Company routinely enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar. Approximately $3.3 million of these Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable are considered by management to be of a short-term nature whereby the appreciation or devaluation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar will result in a gain or loss, respectively, to the consolidated statement of operations. The Company considers the remaining $24.2 million Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable to be of a long-term nature and whereby settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future; therefore, any resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are reported in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of other comprehensive income in accordance with ASC 830 \u201cForeign Currency Matters\u201d. In June 2016, the Company entered into a $3.0 million 90-day hedge contract with a United States bank to hedge a portion of its short-term Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate exposure. This contract reduces the impact on cash flows from movements in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar currency exchange rate, but has not been designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. At June 30, 2016, the fair value of this contract was a liability of $11,000.\nequivalents, trade and other receivables and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value on the respective balance sheet dates.\nThe Company applies fair value techniques on a non-recurring basis in evaluating potential impairment losses related to long-lived assets.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company made non-cash inventory transfers of $3.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively, to its rental equipment fleet. Raw materials include semi-finished goods and component parts totaling $52.5 million and $48.4 million, respectively, at June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.\nThe Company had no long-term debt outstanding at June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.\nOn March 2, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Frost Bank with borrowing availability of $50.0 million (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). On May 4, 2015, the Company amended the Credit Agreement which reduced its borrowing availability to $30.0 million with amounts available for borrowing determined by a borrowing base. Under the amendments to the Credit Agreement, the borrowing base is determined based upon certain of the Company\u2019s and its U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 assets which include (i) 80% of certain accounts receivable plus (ii) 50% of certain notes receivable (such result not to exceed $10 million) plus (iii) 25% of certain inventories (excluding work-in-process inventories). As of June 30, 2016, the Company\u2019s borrowing base was $35.3 million resulting in borrowing availability of $30.0 million less $0.5 million of outstanding letters of credit. The Company\u2019s domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and such subsidiaries have secured their obligations under such guarantees by the pledge of substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries, except real property assets. The Credit Agreement expires on May 4, 2018 and all borrowed funds are due and payable at that time. The Company is required to make monthly interest payments on borrowed funds. The Credit Agreement as amended limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness, requires the maintenance of a single financial ratio that compares certain of the Company\u2019s assets to certain of its liabilities, restricts the Company and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay cash dividends and contains other covenants customary in agreements of this type. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Agreement as amended is based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate, which was 3.50% at June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued 182,400 shares of restricted stock under its 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the \u201cPlan\u201d). The weighted average grant date fair value of the restricted stock was $14.84 per share. The grant date fair value of these awards was $2.7 million, which will be charged to expense over the next four years as the restrictions lapse. Compensation expense for restricted stock awards was determined based on the closing market price of the Company\u2019s stock on the date of grant applied to the total number of shares that are anticipated to fully vest. Recipients of restricted stock awards are entitled to vote such shares and are entitled to dividends, if paid.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2016, the Company also issued 69,300 nonqualified stock options under the Plan. The options issued are based upon three tiers, each with separate market and service based vesting conditions. Market based vesting conditions are based on achieving a specified market return on the Company\u2019s stock price. Compensation expense for the nonqualified stock option awards was determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation, which incorporates the possibility that the market conditions may not be satisfied. The weighted average grant date fair value of the options issued was determined to be $5.96 per option resulting in unrecognized compensation costs of $0.4 million, which will be charged to expense over the requisite service period of the options, ranging from 18 to 36 months.\nAs of June 30, 2016, the Company had unrecognized compensation expense of $8.1 million relating to restricted stock awards. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.8 years. In addition, the Company had $0.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonqualified stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.\nAs of June 30, 2016, a total of 276,150 shares of restricted stock and 159,000 nonqualified stock options shares were outstanding.\nFor the calculation of diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, 159,000 stock options and 89,700 stock options, respectively, were excluded in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as a result of their impact being antidilutive.\nThe Company is involved in various pending or potential legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. Management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, because of the inherent uncertainty of litigation. Management is not aware of any material pending or known to be contemplated legal or government proceedings against the Company.\nThe Company reports and evaluates financial information for two segments: Seismic and Non-Seismic. Seismic product lines include: land and marine wireless data acquisition systems, permanent land and seabed reservoir monitoring products and services, geophones and geophone strings, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, telemetry cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other products. The Non-Seismic product lines include: thermal imaging products and industrial products.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T22:14:09Z", "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001115/000156459016022877/geos-10q_20160630.htm", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The film captures current participants and alumni from YouthBuild Just-A-Start as they explore and pursue career pathways withing the health care industry. Developing pathways to health care related careers has been recognized by YouthBuild USA as a best practice for creating promising futures for our young people.

This was accomplished by landscaping the State House front lawn.\nOn Wednesday May 23rd, students and staff from six Massachusetts YouthBuild programs gathered to volunteer their service. This group committed to the landscaping project for the fourth consecutive year by planting red and white geranium flowers and impatiens. They also assisted with pruning of tree shrubs and bushes.\nDuring the lunch hour Congressman William Keating, came out to visit with the students. They had a chance to introduce themselves and inform Congressman Keating of what projects they have been working on. To wrap up the day, YouthBuild students made their way into the State House to meet with, among others, Senator Eileen Donoghue of Lowell who has been a strong supporter of YouthBuild.\nThis was a wonderful experience and there was a great turn out. Members of the State House staff were proud see young people and adult supervisors working together to take care of the property.

{"text": "Amish Broccoli Cauliflower Salad tossed in a creamy dressing of yogurt and mayonnaise. This easy recipe is perfect for gatherings and low carb friends.\nThe first time I had a raw broccoli salad was at my bridal shower over 20 years ago. My mother\u2019s recipe for broccoli salad had bacon and cranberries. Yum. It\u2019s been my family\u2019s go-to summer salad ever since. But it\u2019s nice to change things up once in awhile. This Amish broccoli cauliflower salad does it for me. It\u2019s especially a hit with the cheese lovers in the family!\nI have a recipe for low carb broccoli salad with bacon on the blog. I love it because it\u2019s so easy to customize. I add nuts and seeds by whim and sometimes add a few raisins or unsweetened cranberries. A little sesame oil adds a pleasant sweet flavor.\nWhat I really like about this Amish broccoli cauliflower salad recipe is the cheese. Using sharp cheddar cheese adds a nice tang and texture to the salad.\nSome recipes for Amish cauliflower salad call for grated cheddar cheese, but I like it cubed. I admit it\u2019s purely based on aesthetics. The grated cheese mixes well, but the salad becomes a creamy indiscernible mess. Cubing the cheese adds another visible layer of texture.\nThis recipe, too, is easy to customize. Try replacing the cheddar cheese with Parmesan or any other favorite. Add seeds or nuts \u2013 sunflower seeds would be great. Try using a colored variety of cauliflower for fun.\nAnd who doesn\u2019t like a cool creamy dressing? Many recipes for Amish broccoli salad call for a combination of mayonnaise and sour cream. I opted to use mayonnaise and Greek yogurt. Use either \u2013 they\u2019re both great.\nThe salad keeps well in the fridge and is a great for family gatherings or a pot-luck. I make sure to bring low carb sides or sugar-free desserts to any gatherings so that I have a few on-plan options.\nAmish Broccoli Cauliflower Salad is 3 net carbs per cup.\nMeanwhile, wash and chop the vegetables and place into a large bowl. If serving the salad the next day, cover and refrigerate.\nMix the ingredients for the dressing in a medium bowl and taste to adjust the seasoning. Cover and refrigerate if not using right away.\nToss the salad ingredients with the broccoli then stir in the dressing. (I use less dressing than the recipe makes - as shown in the photos, but you may want to use it all.) Serve.\nRefrigerate any leftovers up to 5 days. Makes 7 cups at 1 cup per serving.\n*Use regular sugar if not following a low carb or sugar free diet.\nYet again another winner! I was looking for a recipe that is similar to a broccoli salad dish I used to get for lunch at a pizza place near where I used to work. This one fits the bill and then some. This will be in my recipe rotation for sure \u2013 thank you again for your wonderful recipes and website!\nThis was the best salad I\u2019ve had in a very long time! Husband requested again for the next nights dinner!\nYum! Another winning recipe. This is perfect for summer. Everyone loved it. I made it according to directions, but added an additional tablespoon of lemon juice to thin the dressing a little. I also used grated cheese because that\u2019s what I had on hand. Thank you!\nIs the serving size one cup?\nIf I\u2019m preparing this to serve the next day, is it ok to mix dressing with veggies or should I wait until next day?\nLooks delicious! The article doesn\u2019t repeat Amish broccoli cauliflower salad enough, IMO.\nSuch a delicious salad! Worth making!\nThanks so much Anita for bringing this comment over from Facebook. I\u2019m glad you liked the recipe. Enjoy your week! ?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T22:01:17Z", "url": "https://www.lowcarbmaven.com/amish-broccoli-cauliflower-salad/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "When it comes to gifting your beloved parents with flowers, you do not have to physically travel miles to gift it to them personally if you live in another city. There are credible flower delivery websites that give you the chance to order flowers online and send them fresh flowers as a symbol of your love and appreciation. With these sites, you effectively can make them feel special and wanted on any special occasion when you are not here to wish and be with them.\nNow if you are sending anniversary flowers to your parents, you might surprise them by looking at their wedding photographs and choosing the flowers that were present in them. The best thing about online websites that sell flowers is that you will find a wide array of them on a single platform. These sites are much more convenient than walking into a store and finding out that the flowers that you want are not available. This, of course, can become very disappointing and frustrating.\nIf you want to gift your parents some special flowers that have a unique charm and appeal, choose flowers that have vines on them. These flowers can be grown indoors for a while, and you can later place them outdoors. Some unique examples of flowers that you can grow on vines are morning glory, clematis, and sweet peas. If your parents are celebrating their 30th anniversary, you may consider gifting them with morning glory. There are several flower delivery Canada websites that will give you fresh flowers that you may order and send to your beloved parents.\nNow, if your parents are holding an anniversary party and you have been invited to it, gifting flowers that go with the theme is indeed a great idea. When it comes to placing orders for flowers and bouquets, it is essential for you first to determine your budget. It is crucial for you to be aware of what you can afford when you are buying flowers for your parents. If you are aware of the theme of the anniversary party, it is vital for you to work within this color scheme. The flowers that you choose will give the place a custom look.\nLast but not the least, when it comes to buying flowers for your parents, ensure that you consider the season. Seasonal flowers are widely available, and you do not have to spend extra money to buy them. Remember when it comes to some of the flowers that you or your parent might like, they are not available around the year. For instance, violet is a flower available in winter. Therefore, when you are buying flowers for your parents ensure which ones are available for the season and get hold of fresh flowers of that month. This will help you arrange fresh flowers for any party or occasion and save money as you do not have to pay extra to procure off seasonal flowers that need to be procured if they can search by flower selling websites!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T17:09:45Z", "url": "http://www.calisia.net/make-parents-feel-loved-flowers-delivered-doorstep/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Where should routes be defined?\nBootPHP provides a very powerful routing system. In essence, routes provide an interface between the urls and your controllers and actions. With the correct routes you could make almost any url scheme correspond to almost any arrangement of controllers, and you could change one without impacting the other.\nAs mentioned in the Request Flow section, a request is handled by the Request class, which will look for a matching Route and load the appropriate controller to handle that request.\nIt is important to understand that routes are matched in the order they are added, and as soon as a URL matches a route, routing is essentially \"stopped\" and the remaining routes are never tried. Because the default route matches almost anything, including an empty url, new routes must be place before it.\nThe default route is simply provided as a sample, you can remove it and replace it with your own routes.\nSo this creates a route with the name default that will match urls in the format of (<controller>(/<action>(/<id>))).\nLet's take a closer look at each of the parameters of Route::set, which are `name`, `uri`, and an optional array `regex`.\nThe name of the route must be a unique string. If it is not it will overwrite the older route with the same name. The name is used for creating urls by reverse routing, or checking which route was matched.\nThe uri is a string that represents the format of urls that should be matched. The tokens surrounded with `<>` are keys and anything surrounded with `()` are optional parts of the uri. In BootPHP routes, any character is allowed and treated literally aside from `()<>`. The `/` has no meaning besides being a character that must match in the uri. Usually the `/` is used as a static seperator but as long as the regex makes sense, there are no restrictions to how you can format your routes.\nLets look at the default route again, the uri is `((/(/)))`. We have three keys or params: controller, action, and id. In this case, the entire uri is optional, so a blank uri would match and the default controller and action (set by defaults(), covered below) would be assumed resulting in the `Controller_Welcome` class being loaded and the `action_index` method being called to handle the request.\nController - The controller that the request should execute.\nAction - The action method to call.\nThe BootPHP route system uses perl compatible regular expressions in its matching process. By default each key (surrounded by `<>`) will match `[^/.,;?\\n]++` (or in english: anything that is not a slash, period, comma, semicolon, question mark, or newline). You can define your own patterns for each key by passing an associative array of keys and patterns as an additional third argument to Route::set.\nIn this example, we have controllers in two directories, admin and affiliate. Because this route will only match urls that begin with admin or affiliate, the default route would still work for controllers in classes/controller.\nYou can also use a less restrictive regex to match unlimited parameters, or to ignore overflow in a route. In this example, the url foobar/baz/and-anything/else_that/is-on-the/url would be routed to Controller_Foobar::action_baz() and the \"stuff\" parameter would be \"and-anything/else_that/is-on-the/url\". If you wanted to use this for unlimited parameters, you could explode it, or you just ignore the overflow.\nIf a key in a route is optional (or not present in the route), you can provide a default value for that key by passing an associated array of keys and default values to Route::defaults, chained after your Route::set. This can be useful to provide a default controller or action for your site, among other things.\nThe `controller` and `action` key must always have a value, so they either need to be required in your route (not inside of parentheses) or have a default value provided.\nIn the default route, all the keys are optional, and the controller and action are given a default. If we called an empty url, the defaults would fill in and `Controller_Welcome::action_index()` would be called. If we called `foobar` then only the default for action would be used, so it would call `Controller_Foobar::action_index()` and finally, if we called `foobar/baz` then neither default would be used and `Controller_Foobar::action_baz()` would be called.\nYou can also use defaults to set a key that isn't in the route at all.\nAs you can see in the below route, the reverse uri parameter might not make sense.\n* You don't like slashes?\nThe Request::param method takes an optional second argument to specify a default return value in case the key is not set by the route. If no arguments are given, all keys are returned as an associative array. In addition, `action`, `controller` and `directory` are not accessible via Request::param().\nIf a url matches the route, then `Controller_Ads::index()` will be called. You can access the parameters by using the `param()` method of the controller's Request. Remember to define a default value (via the second, optional parameter of Request::param) if you didn't in `->defaults()`.\nThe established convention is to either place your custom routes in the `MODPATH//init.php` file of your module if the routes belong to a module, or simply insert them into the `APPPATH/bootstrap.php` file (be sure to put them above the default route) if they are specific to the application. Of course, nothing stops you from including them from an external file, or even generating them dynamically.\nLet's say you decided later to make that route definition more verbose by changing it to `feeds/<user_id>(/).`. If you wrote your code with the above uri generation method you wouldn't have to change a single line! When a part of the uri is enclosed in parentheses and specifies a key for which there in no value provided for uri generation and no default value specified in the route, then that part will be removed from the uri. An example of this is the `(/)` part of the default route; this will not be included in the generated uri if an id is not provided.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T04:46:23Z", "url": "https://bootcms.kilofox.net/index.php/guide/bootphp/routing", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "It is no secret that the husband and I have built a fairly extensive network at home. It started way back when when I studied towards the NT4 MCSE, and, over the years, as new products were released, we added those products to our network to further our learning.\nYesterday, we wiped our domain controller, and started fresh on 2008. Using the Add Roles wizard got a little confusing, so I reverted to the more familiar dcpromo, which made a lot more sense, and didn\u2019t feel much different from 2003. Of course, the AD roles are now extended and sparkly new, so you have to pay attention during the wizard.

No reverse lookup zone was created, and there were a couple of other things I needed to tweak as well. I am a little concerned, because the self-tests continuously fail, so I am still not convinced that the DNS install is 100% super\u2014duper, but, for now, the network is working, so I am not going to play too much right now (ie. I will fix this later).\nWe have also been doing a SQL consolidation, and I am going to attempt to rewrite our intranet in ASP.net with a SQL2008 back-end. I have been threatening for years to do this, and I suppose that time has come.\nOne of the reasons we decided to start over was because we had been installing a variety of services into the old domain that made a bit of a mess to the schema, especially because we didn\u2019t clean up correctly \u2013 reinstalled machines without removing the applications correctly, that kind of thing. One of the big culprits here was LCS.\nGranted, we make these mistakes because it is a home environment, so it is not critical to achieve 9 sigma, but we have also learnt some good lessons that we may actually one day apply in corporate environments.\nAnd while it is not important at home to have 100% uptime, we do strive to stay up as much as possible, especially because we do actually make use of some of these services to keep our home running, such as schedule all family outings via Exchange and keep track of our budget and shopping lists via our intranet web.

O&apos;Donnell predicted they would reach into \"the tens of millions of dollars.\"\nA call seeking comment from Cowell was not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\"We have not even been served with the complaint in this matter, and so have no comment,\" said ABC spokeswoman Annie Fort.\nThe suit also names FremantleMedia North America, producer of FOX&apos;s \"American Idol\" and proposed producer of ABC&apos;s \"The Million Dollar Idea.\" (Note the slightly different title.) FremantleMedia does not comment on pending litigation, spokesman Brian Reinert said.\n\"Million Dollar Idea\" first aired on KSTC-TV in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market in 2003. The series was recently syndicated to more than 125 stations nationwide and its creators registered for both copyright and trademark for the show&apos;s name and premise, according to their statement.\nThe show is taped before an audience and judges at the Mall of America.

Petrichor, the scent of rain filled my lungs predicting the approaching rain, the touch of which would cease my burning but I am not ready to taste the freedom from this fire. In addition to these I know how to eradicate the darkness as I have the capacity to turn on the light even at the darkest times of life.\nThe rain can come down to the earth anytime and I have to take shelter before that but still I wait at the banks waiting for the darkness to break into dawn. This has been my routine from past week to sprint around the seashore of this sea at the darkest hour before the dawn and wait for the moment of darkness breaking into the dawn. To watch the sun to gain its position high in the sky, paint his colors over the world showing his supremacy to kill darkness of life. It is not only the sun but also me who feels that has spread my color all over the world.\nSlowly the sun made its way out of his den painting the whole sky bright redish yellow with its rays. Consuming the gloomy night and spreading the light bringing new hope & a beginning of bright fresh life. Once I had witnessed the magnificent sight of sunrise my concentration went towards my sense which had alerted about the approaching rain. But now there was no sign of it, that left me astonished as rain is one thing I just hate it and my senses have never been wrong in identifying them. Leaving that thought aside I make my way back to the hostel which has become my new home from where I will have to attend my first day of my master\u2019s classes today.\nNot before I had turned my eyes get struck to the sight of a girl in bluish white suit running away something was there about her unknown which made me watch her till she disappeared from my vision. I have been coming here from past 5 days but never did I saw any girl at this time of the hour. She did turn back once but I could not see her face. Just then I heard my cell beep reminding me of the time & I headed back still I couldn\u2019t stop myself to watch at the way she ran off.\nSome things never change every where the seniors welcoming the juniors especially in there own innovative way. I had just entered the gates of my college when a group of people naming themselves as seniors blocked my way. They were many more already in queues who were dancing as puppets of seniors. I had a strong urge to teach them a good lesson but I couldn\u2019t just barge in and destruct everything but that would only catch the attention of everyone. Now itself I can feel many eyes on me, that always annoy me.\nAgainst my wishes I simply follow there orders to stand in the queue and wait for my turn to come. Just then there was absolute silence as everyone\u2019s attention was on the entrance maybe another junior\u2019s who are trying to dorge away from these ragging session? But No. when I look at the entrance I could only see a beautiful mesmerising alluring blue eyes of the girl, they captivated me in its pools as deep as oceans that I can get lost in them. It was a picture painted in blue theme, every essence of her oozed as serene beauty. I could no longer see the world around me just her only; everything around her seems to vanish away from my view. As if in the whole world it is you and me alone, with my every breath, with my every heartbeat clearly wanting to be with you. Her earrings kissed her cheeks everytime she kept walking her bangles made sounds of waves in the ocean which was matching her light blue & white mixed dress. Is she the same one whom I saw in the beach today, looks like she is as even at that time she wored the same dress, the same gait, the same care free strides. Today I felt like I got a whole new world to live in.\nI don\u2019t know when my legs take me away from the crowd towards the object of my interest but I was pulled back by something. When I turn to see what that was I saw it was the guy next to me who pulled me back, he was saying something which I failed to hear it. I turned back my gaze to her; she was not there; I turn around everywhere only to find her in front of those seniors. I moved in a way to have clear view of her face without any interruption. Her eyes had a gleam of naughtiness which I didn\u2019t know for what.\nI felt another nudge in my hand to jolt me into the reality. It was again the same guy but now I heard him say \u201cMan, what are you doing come back and stand here, don\u2019t mess with seniors. See how these girls got them in trouble.\u201d The word Girls made me look at them again to find another girl beside her. All of them were watching her ignoring the pleasant beauty of mine. They were questioning them, that is when I got to know her name is Geet & the girl whom I just noticed her name is Pari.\nGeet, the name rang in my ears inveigling my heart with unknown bliss. Such a melodious name she has got that I could only hear and speak her name throughout the remaining life of mine. My heart was showing its presence more than ever with her first visual itself, weaving many desires which could bind me into something which I never was bound to. Thoughts are flying high freeing it self from the strings of my mind. Spirit is flowing in a direction which it had never crossed but it surged without bothering about any hindrance. Wish I could just embrace this moment in myself, to witness a new facet of the dreams. Her eyes were revealing more than she could every voice out surprising me at the things which it could conceal. I was eager to be with her which made my heart to live.\nDilon mein tum apni betabiyan leke chal rahe ho.\nMy revive was broken when the guy next to me was biting his nails in nervousness as he was worried for the girl next to Geet, as he was muttering \u201cPlease God save Pari from these ragging\u2019s\u201d but what I saw actually amazed me as that girl Pari stood fearless while my Geet stood behind her hiding herself from the situation. Such a contrary thing it was happening I was not scared for Geet as I knew she could come out the situation without any help where as the guy next to me was praying for Pari while the girls were doing just the opposite. But Geet\u2019s eyes shone bright, calm & undeterred confidence trickled in her every stir though she portrayed as fearful infront of everyone. She held on to the facade of a timid girl duping around the others. Her face can deceive everyone but her eyes couldn\u2019t as they told every story of hers. She was not a meek girl, none could scrum her into doing things against her wishes, but why does she have to do things like that.\nApparently the situation in the hand was the senior\u2019s portrayed themselves as generous enough to give us the option to whether we want to get ragged or not. Well that was not a real option though as a person would be asked to light the candle once they did it they would say since you have lighted it that means you have accepted to be ragged. So now the candle was placed in the middle of the stand and the girls were asked to light that. I was more interested to see the play as I read her eyes which had the mischievous glint in it. And just I guessed the fun started Geet\u2019s face turned was something everyone could not miss as it turned pale with fear and she clutched Pari\u2019s hand & fainted next second.\nFor a second even I got worried but then the wink confirmed all my doubts. Getting the clue Pari played along shouting \u201cGeet\u2026\u2026.what happened Geet\u2026get up\u2026 get up\u2026. Please someone get some water.\u201d After a while she stood drawing everyones attention to herself. When the seniors questioned her, the reply just shook everyone but I was just lost in that melody and couldn\u2019t stop the smile. Geet replied as a scared kitten shuttering and trying to hard to form even a word that \u201cI burnt it \u2026. I burnt it\u201d. Well ever Pari was confused so enquired \u201cwhat did you burn Geet.\u201d \u201cB\u2026..B\u2026\u2026Blub\u201d But looks like seniors were not falling for her drama as she was asked to light the candle now.\nI was now curious to know more about her plan as the naught sparkle twinkled in her eyes. She with trembling fingers tried to light the candle but stick failed to burn. Geet said \u201cIt is not burning so can I leave for the class sir.\u201d Finally not able to withstand the bugging kitten they let go of her. We will trap her someother time is what I heard a senior whisper into another senior. Her eyes showed she had won this play but that play was not only for her but for everyone there. With a confident & smiling face she left, actually she was concealling more may be she would have danced at her victory but stayed quite because of the people around her.\nAfter she left what happened was really a boon to others as none were able to light the candle with the sticks and were given a green signal to leave to class without any interruption as none of the juniors revealed that the stick had been damp. Actually what had happened was when Geet had feel on the ground the box had feel down in moist grass, which none of them saw at that time. Now the seniors were getting suspicious why none are able to light it are they acting? Then one of them noticed the wetness of the sticks. So when it was my turn they changed the rule if you light it only then you will be set free.\nI never had lost any game or battle then how could I just bow down when it was the question of lighting a candle. I made my hands covered there vision of the candle and the stick and within seconds I lit the candle without any trouble. What did they thought that this is the only stick through which the light could be generated. There are other ways to do that & winning over me is not going to happen ever. Without any further delay I dropped the match box in the nearby bin & went to the class with a stride which meant not to be stopped by anyone.\nI was joined by the guy who came running towards me while he said \u201cHey man, slow down, how did you do that\u201d. I didn\u2019t stop but started to move towards my designated class. When he came in front of me introducing himself \u201cHi, I am Yash and you are\u201d \u201cMaan\u201d was the only thing which I said and entered my class to see Geet in the same class of mine.\nAnother lecture starts from today, well that is one thing I always disliked but still I have never let the other person to feel that I am not one of the keen listener as I don\u2019t ignore them but just bear there words which some or the other time has been useful. This time I had a silver lining say it a distraction or attraction which would last for atleast a little while.\nI entered the class to witness Geet who sat at the front bench with her was Pari, looks like both are friends that they are sticking together. Class was almost full any time the classes would start as the time to start was nearing. I sat away from everyone as I was never a man who needed company.\nMy loneliness didn\u2019t last for long as it was accompanied by the slim nerd with broad forehead and wide cheek bones that narrow to a small chin with the naroow frame spectacles guy Yash I wished it was Geet beside me but this time I have to bear with this one as the guy, yes Yash was behind me and had followed me to the place where I had selected to sit. Well there was a special thing at this position and that was the view I would get, from here I could see the professors & behind the dias was a glass on which the image I could see was of the reflection of Geet.\nTime passed a person came said something and then my eyes went back to Geet who was busy in writing and then she was lost in seeing something when I glanced where she was looking at I saw some other person who stood at the podium. I wonder where the other person went but before I could ponder about that my eyes went on the pen which was just about to touch the curvy glossy lips of hers.\nConstant bugging of Yash gained my attention as he was mentioning something about some Economics, business and management I glared back at him to stop him from irritating me. As I take a quick look at the platform to witness yet another different person there. Have I started seeing things, was that a mirage or did the face of the person change like chameleon?\nI wanted to see what was happening around so I kept watching him but as the person was a lean bald guy he wasn\u2019t covering the glass behind giving me more access t0 my distraction she was time & again glancing over her lace tied around her wrist. It took a minute more to realise she was getting bored maybe that\u2019s why she was checking the time. That is when I checked the time which said 3 and half hours has been passed since I have been sitting here in this place. That means this is the 4th class of the day & I haven\u2019t heard a word from anyone.\nSuddenly Geet\u2019s face had shone and next second there was a long ring indicating the end of the first session and once the unknown professor left the room she & Pari flew from there may be they were hungry. Half n hour of break like everyone I too headed towards the canteen to check what I can get to fill my appetite. I had got one plate of food and sat away from the crowd when I saw my hearts leisure pursuit the blue girl getting her plate filled with food.\nI saw them looking at the whole canteen to check for a place just then Yash who was just behind them showed the table where I am sitting. He wanted to watch her everymove but staring like that when the other person was watching straight back at you was not manners and that too when I held the fire to consume her.\nMy eyes were unwilling to obey my order to look anywhere but her. Then somehow I managed to concentrate on the food but it was just for a second then it was back on her. Fortunately this time she was looking at something else at the other end. She was looking at that direction more intently making my inside to burn. I turned my gaze towards her vision and that enraged me again as Geet was looking at the seniors and one of them who was leading the ragging session was heading to our table. I wouldn\u2019t mind breaking his bones or even burning him to show him the glimpse of hell.\nHe was just a feet away from his table when the ground under him vanished as he lost balance and swan through the air bang his nose to the ground. He was carrying a plate of food he had picked it up on his way and all of it he had been carrying in his hand fell on his head and finally even the plate hit his head giving him the award he deserved. That\u2019s when I noticed the wet floor and the caution board kept to be careful as the floor was slippery.\nA slight giggle caught my ears out of the whole laugh going around the canteen and that was from none other than the girl who sat infront of me. She was trying very hard not to laugh as it would only instigate the others and bring us under their scanner. But even then she couldn\u2019t stop the smile that escaped against her wishes and adored her lips. The twinkle in her eyes which held the power to hypnotise even a saint.\nIt was the first time she sat so close to me and I was failing to stick to my previous decision of not to stare at her but when did the heart listen when God\u2019s such a exquisite creation was right before my eyes. She had her eyes fixed on the table I just didn\u2019t know what is so interesting out there on it while I couldn\u2019t move my gaze from her. I wished she looked up to me at least once so that I could read what she was thinking. Maybe she didn\u2019t noticed me till now as she was busy with the laugh she got to see here but before I could make that statement sink into my heart she raised her lashes to meet my molten eyes to lose the whole world around us or to find a new way together.\nChange is the only thing which is constant in life and is the same thing which I am experiencing now. My sense\u2019s which has always been active in alerting me of my surroundings has changed its allegiance. My eyes never leaves the sight of her as it only tries to find more about her while I always search to hear her melodious voice in every sound that hits my ears, I wait for the moment of slight touch of her veil every time we have bump into one another. It takes every ounce of my will to resist from tasting this forbidden fruit. She is all bent to change me as she smells like a dew drop making me to hate the thought why I hated that before.\nThe fact which I always certain about eradicating the darkness & lighting it seems to be lost with the way my life had taken a turn. My day which always used to start with the sprinting before the breaking of dawn to keep me fit and focussed has also changed. Now after sprinting I would do my exercise using fire to help me keep focus on the issue that is on the hand. Every day I try new ways with fire I would light up the edges of the stick with fire and swinging the blazing stick in different ways so as to wipe out that vision which has plastered to my eyes.\nThat day when our eyes had met, the world around me had just ceased to exist. Those deep blue eyes held me captive in her spell that I felt I wandered into a place where every thing was so serene that I didn\u2019t know whether I was lost before or am I getting lost now. I was looking deep into violet & green mixed pupils of her to find what all secrets that could unfold infront of me. But what I found was a haze image of person\u2019s face which started to disturb the tranquilly of those orbs a bit later what I saw was it was not just the disturbance but vanquishing the glow with the flame of that persons mere presence which turned into my face. That was the harsh reality of mine which broke my trance and I had left the table in a rush leaving everyone to ponder anything what they wish.\nI would now rather light up the whole place to make me remember the fact of my presence in anyones life would only harm everyone. How could I forget why I am all alone? I break one another stick that was in my hand with the rage which had only amplified the concealed fire in me. I have led lonely life because of this reason, when ever I have lost focused I have not only lost my dearest and nearest but also have felt the burnt of it my own self. How unlucky am I to even not retain a companion for even a small part of this long life. With these thoughts cruising in my mind everytime I would never know when the dawn breaks & the day starts. But with my starting ignorance with the surroundings one had not left to remind me about my college and that was Yash who used to call me with his stupid problems.\nExactly now I got a call from Yash making me realise the time as even the sun elevated high in the sky failed to be gain my attention as I was busy fight with the inner battle. I switched on the Bluetooth and without a second delay he started his cribbing.\nThat reminds me of the act of last night when I had held the light in my hand & had snapping the fingers lighting it & switching it off with my thoughts running about the past and trying to get the things straight in present.\n\u201c15 minutes.\u201d I reply and make my way to start yet another day just like past 8 months but before I leave this shore I put of the fire which I had set around the place. Out of all these things against me this is one thing that I am glad of this deserted place to give me my privacy.\nAs always my eyes search that place where I had seen her on the first day but as every other day even today I couldn\u2019t see her there maybe it was just by chance that she was here that day. I again console my heart which still wants to see her against my will. And in these 8 months every single day didn\u2019t end without an encounter of ours but every time I shifted my course away from her as those eyes held something which could not be comprehend. During the classes I try to gauge her reactions but she didn\u2019t let me through her lashes making it difficult to read her.\nThings which made these encounter possible were Yash & Pari and their budding love story. There talks left me know more about Geet, how she is, how even she came here after losing her family. How lonely she has become now and how she is coping with her life. What her aims are, how she has influenced Pari to be more focused about the future. I get to hear each and every word about them from Yash.\nThere is not a single place in the college which doesn\u2019t remind me of our encounter and just a week ago when Geet was searching for Pari near this fountain at the entrance of the college where I am standing that was the time we met again face to face to let me read her mind through her own blue eyes.\nThis time when the cover of her lashes had been shed for my view all I could see was the same mischief gleam in it. But what is she upto now, did that senior again became the scapegoat of her acts. She has been enjoying that senior\u2019s state to an extent which none knew except me as always after every fall of his she had walked away with a winning stride. One thing which even I didn\u2019t know was did she do anything which always landed him in trouble or was that a pure coincidence that whenever she was present he was embarrassed with one or the other thing.\nLast time I had accompanied Yash to the mall as girls wanted to do there shopping while Yash wanted to join them and I also went along with him. Once they had roamed alround the mall we had settled down in the food court to fill the hunger of stomach. The seating arrangement was in a semi circle round the table and at one end was Geet next to her was Pari and next was Yash, after him I sat.\nI smiled looking at the them planning for the seminar which I didn\u2019t even know there was I never had to bothered for any academic activity as even before I realise the need of the work it would have been done for me too. Yash was someone who used to do it for me I never did ask him for but he simple did it for me and then it become a silent treaty that he used to hand over all the assignments to me. I could have asked him the reason for it but then I never indulged in talking with anyone not even Yash, who was my hostel roommate.\nPari loved Yash but always gets irritated with his \u201cI am scared attitude\u201d college works were not an issue but handling the world or people was something he always held a back foot. I guess this was the reason Yash always used to be with me scared to be alone, scared that he might just get into trouble and I tagged with him because he never asked any questions about me but just used to bug me with non stop talking about the college or Pari or her friend Geet. That was much more than a vital reason to actually tolerate him and his actions.\nThere was sudden hustle bustle in the food court, apparently some waiter was pushed by someone making all the food in his hand to spilled on the ground and that person was none other than our same senior who had lead our ragging session. The owner was all set to bash the waiter & dismiss him from the job as he thougt the waiter couldn\u2019t even handle his customers properly, creating disturbance to them and also damaging his places aesthetics.\nAnd this senior of ours who was having fun in this trouble just was leaving creating the mess and while crossing over the table next us the kid who sat there was supposed to have her milk in the bottle but the kid opened the cap in a way that all the milk erupted out of it spilling it all over the place along with the wetting the pants of our beloved senior in turn making him embarrass infront of all the people. At that time her eyes showed \u201cyou deserve it\u201d look.\nToday too her eyes conveyed the same thing to me but who deserves that, was that me or was that someone else. I was still searching for answers when a loud laughter hit my ears and that was of Yash & Pari who came running & laughing even before I could ask them they started to narrate that the gardener was having trouble why water stopped suddenly coming in his pipes while watering the plants and then he tried to twist them in all direction water gushed out like a stream which unfortunately showered on our same darling senior.\nOnce Yash was here I moved out to our hostel when Yash again started his pleading to accompany him to Pari\u2019s house as she had challenged him \u201cYash if you love me you have to come to my hime without getting scared of my owner who stayed next door. Only then I will talk to you.\u201d Did I needed this pleadings no defiantly no, but still how would I just give in so I gave him \u201cI am not interested\u201d look and then I finally agreed to him.\nWe knocked at the door of the girl\u2019s home late at 12 midnight as it was quite a distance we had to travel. There was hesitation quite visible on Pari\u2019s face as she opened the windows to check who is banging the door at this hour. I could clearly see one was shocked while the other pretended to be shocked as she was not afraid of facing any situation. As it was a season of rain many would come inside the front yard for shelter but now it wasn\u2019t raining either and even if it was entertaining an outsider at this hour was not safe.\nWe stood at a distance so when she checked the window none were visible, then she had a confused look thinking who banged on the door. Just when she thought to close the window and return to bed we came out of the shadows scaring her a bit as she asked who it is. But only thing she heard was her own sound and crackle sound of the dry leaves.\nSurprise was the word Yash screamed making her squeal in shock but then she was happy to find her love leaving his inhabitation self.\nSurprise was the word Yash screamed making her squeal in shock but then she was happy to find her love there leaving his inhabitation self and visiting her.\n\u201cYash is this the way you come. There is a calling bell which you could always use then why were you banging the door like that. You just scared the hell out of us.\u201d Pari growled on Yash.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why she gets scared suddenly of such little things.\u201d said Pari referring to Geet\u2019s action.\n\u201cYash left a sigh once Geet left as he can have his little talk with Pari now without interruption. Now you will do as I say\u201d Yash whispered.\nLooking at them I thought they need a little more privacy so\u2026.\nI left that place at once and started to move backwards when I heard something rather say some sound. That made me realised that the path I choose leads to the back yard of the house where Geet went. The thought that she is there was enough for me to move more faster my mind constantly warned me not to go and face at this time but when did mind had any say in front of this heart.\nMy luck was not with me today as suddenly there was lighting followed by a noisy thunder. Normally boys liked these situations where girls would be scared and cling to boys but here it was a different story as I despised rain. Seeing the pouring rain my legs freeze at the place I was safe under the shelter in the pitch darkness where no one knew anyone would exist. Even in the most solitary life I have an angel who had descended from the heaven whom I could gaze till my hearts content.\nGeet was in her light violet velvet suit stood admiring the sky above. I stood as far as possible but my eyes could view her from head to toe, I guess she was also standing below some shelter as there was not a drop of rain falling on her. She was not only admiring it but also waiting for the rain to fall as the moment she stretched her palm a drop fell on it, she did the same again and again collecting the drops of the rain in her palm. It looked as if the rain was waiting for the orders of her to fall. Once it was full she let them drop on the ground making the sound like pearls were falling off from the necklace as they didn\u2019t just fall but also they had another path to follow.\nShe was the commander in chief imposing the flow of rain. Slowly the drops of rain increased & made its way from her shoulders to her long silky hands gliding over them to reach the small little fingers of her just before they descended to reach there fellow droplets. If that was the sight I beheld unknown to her next set of her acts just made my insides move as molten lava.\nThe water which blessed themselves touching her forehead slid through the sides measuring the length of her sleek neck before they disappeared into the fabric. The view brought him of my revive giving me a reality check about my act. I was not supposed to look at her like this minutely. She has always hid behind the mask of a meek girl and now thinking no one is here she would have let those masks off her face.\nShe might have not been this free had she known about my presence here. But I didn\u2019t have it in me to turn back from her. This time I wanted her to decide and it would be easy on me to feel her rejection than turning back from her. With this decision I let my legs lead towards the magnetic pull.\nI couldn\u2019t have stepped in rain too so I stood at the rim of the shelter making my presence known to her. Passing the message towards her clearly that she is not alone to let her barriers down and baring her oneself to me. She stood in the middle, hands out stretched to let the rain drench her. Even after making my presence evident she didn\u2019t deterred was she so involved in her own world that what is happening around, who is there beside her didn\u2019t matter or was she giving me a treat by letting me to witness her subtle movements of unparalleled grace.\nRain which had drenched her whole form gave a shiny effect to her. With a determination which none could stop her to express herself today neither the rain nor my presence. She bent her back in a semi circle swinging her hands in a way that looked like a white rainbow twinkling in the moon light. Was she dancing with rain or was rain dancing with her, was she following it or was that following her moves was all I could ponder about as she and rain matched steps with each other.\nUnknown to me \u201cGeet\u201d came out from my lips it came out just as a whisper and I doubt whether my own ears heard it or not. But as the name left my lips the rain just came to end like it was waiting for me to utter and it would stop and with not a drop of rain pouring her whole concentration turned to me. I stood there waiting for her reaction, would she walk away as I do or\u2026. I didn\u2019t know what to expect. She slowly closed the distance between us and stood right in front of me.\nHer eyes held an unknown compassion which I could not understand. I felt a sudden chill spreading around me was it the dip in the temperature or was it her who was cooling my fire in me. My eyes closed for a brief second to hide the things which it may give away if I look deep into the blue ones it may questioned me anything. There were many things which my heart wanted to convey but words were just not enough to express them. Many emotions were binding me with you bring in a new flavour sweeping us into a different world. This is the riddle which could not be hidden within me or with in her or even the world.\nI was still entranced in her when I felt her chilled hands touch my cheeks sending shiver down my body. It took only a second to ignite the fire in me; it took lot of efforts to break the shackles to let my hand to stretch so that I could feel that creamy skin. She closed her eyes to engrave the feel of me on her hand, so did I wanted to engrave it. I was just an inch away when she trembled back and before I could comprehend anything or hold her she collapsed on the ground & like how the water gushes out when the gates of the dam are opened the rain poured out on her.\nWhat happened was something has happened with me many times before too when ever I have left my confines things has gone messy. That is the reason why I have to be alone & none are allowed to be with me. My mother left me giving birth to me to live in this world all alone; my father was there only till that another natural calamity which shook more than half of the village when I was a small kid. From that time all I have led is a life alone each day was like a year or even more than that.\nRelatives were there to support me but even that didn\u2019t last for more than few days as they would fell into deep troubles due to me. So I had spent most of my life in an orphanage far away from everyone who was my family once. This was my curse which I am still burdened with. And today that has spread to Geet, she fell the moment I thought to ignore my curse but it was all present to remind me of the repercussions if avoided.\nI still stood the same way gazing at her fallen state; I couldn\u2019t gather enough courage to even check her. What if she also just left because of my mistake? It would have been better to be away than to live in guilt for becoming an endangered curse to someone else. With the sudden enormous sound of water gained the attention of Pari & Yash so they came out to check the reason for it and all they could see was Geet lying in the pool of water while I had lost my voice to tell anything to them.\nI started to take my steps away from her whereas Pari was trying to revive Geet by patting her cheeks. Yash asked her to pull under the shelter first so that she wouldn\u2019t catch cold. They tried to rub her legs & hands it was turning little blue due to chillness of water. Yash looked back at me to ask what happened but what would I reply, there was nothing to tell it was all my fault to have agreed with him to accompany Yash to her place.\nMy strides were moving fast to just hide myself away from everyone especially from those blue eyes mermaid of my life. I push all the things in front of me & put everything on fire with my own hands but would that reduce the blaze in me. Ripping of my self also didn\u2019t reduce the helplessness in me. Why should I be compled to live a life like this with no love no happiness all alone nothing pleasing can exist around me? Why it is that anything that wants to give me bit contentment would turn into ashes before I could embrace it. Why can\u2019t I hold a little bliss in my palm?\nAll I had heard was they were taking her to the nearby doctor, I so wanted to check on her but it was best with me not going near her. I waited at the shores waiting for the sun to break the darkness, which was actually trying to consume me within it. After what seems like eternity I just couldn\u2019t wait more but wanted to know if she was fine, I decided I would only see from far & then will move out before anyone would actually notice my presence.\nI stood at the doorway hearing that melodious voice of speaking to the doctor which was a relief till I heard there talks. The doctor was quite upset about something but what was the fault of Geet in all these things which happened.\n\u201cGeet, I am telling you last time you have to be careful, I can\u2019t hide these things everytime. It was just pure luck that your friends bought you to me, what would have happened if they would have taken you to other doctor.\u201d Doctor was scolding sternly.\n\u201cDoc, I would have managed it.\u201d Geet answered meekly.\n\u201cRight the way you just managed it today. I have answered others as you got dehydrated but I want answers from you now? What happened & how did it happen if you had taken all the precautions.\u201d Doc questioned.\n\u201c2 days, what will I do here for 2 days? I am perfectly fine & I would like to take your leave now as I need to attend the class.\u201d Replied shocked Geet on the sudden order passed by her doctor but when did she listen to others.\n\u201cNo, you are my friend, so bye.\u201d Geet stromed out of the room after saying that.\nThere talk left me in thinking what was it that they were talking about was she hiding something or is she under some medication due to some disease. But if I question the doctor she would definitely not spit out the truth. Doctor must have known Geet for a quite a period and that\u2019s why she was so comfortable & then also she hid the truth with Yash & Pari also that too even before she consulting Geet. I should follow her to know more but after what happened yesterday night I need to be very careful & stay away from her.\nI have been observing her more meticulously from past few hours but nothing actual changed in her ways neither in action nor in words. Still we didn\u2019t speak neither she nor Yash or Pari actually asked me about that night. It was as if nothing happened, don\u2019t know what Geet said to them but they were actually being careful with Geet, making sure that she had lot of liquids. They didn\u2019t let her give presentations in seminar also but only person who regretted that was me as I couldn\u2019t hear her.\nYash asked me to help them in the last seminar and the group discussions for the year before college breaks for the exams so that Geet could take proper rest. I agreed but I didn\u2019t know what I am supposed to do so he gave some notes which I had to go through & speak about them. Seminar was said to be on one of the topics in some subject which we read but the group discussion was just a practice session so that everyone would get good exposure to the presentation skills. I actually wondered what am I going to do as I had not an iota of idea how these are done but this would help Geet is all I know so I had to do it.\nSeminar finished & I don\u2019t exactly remember what all I have to say. Seeing my capabilities with words they had given me a small part. Was that a 5 min material which I finished it in 2 minute or was that only a 1 minutes one for which I too 2. But whatever it was that ended without much hanky panky. Well one hurdle was crossed & the other awaited. Yes the group discussion would start in a while, groups were made. Pari, I & few other class mates were selected and made the group. The topic was read out it was \u201cMyth\u201d.\nWith that few started to oppose it & many started to agree with it. But when I heard what all they were discussing I couldn\u2019t stop my self from putting my view in it.\n\u201cHow could you say that God is a myth\u201d I questioned.\n\u201cIf he was there then people would not have suffered unnecessarily, take your example are you not an orphan\u2026 why?? because God took away your parents that too in a natural calamity which was controlled by God.\u201d Pari replied.\n\u201cIt was not the God who controlled these calamities they are done by the people who are posses the power to protect the nature and people in this world.\u201d I counter replied.\n\u201cOh you are a believer of those grandma bedtime stories in which God entrusts some power to three people who were termed as guards of the earth but these people quarrelled among themselves to attain the supremacy over the human beings. If only one is left they would be invincible who could be termed as equal to God.\u201d Pari questioned.\nThe whole discussion was heating up between Pari & Maan and everyone present there were just a mute spectators as they didn\u2019t know where it all would go to. Some had heard these stories in there childhood from there elders but then with time all these things were termed as only story.\n\u201cYes I am a believer of it but that is not the whole truth what all things they would have to undergo for being a guard is not known to many. Life span of these persons would be more than 400 years which they should be spent away from everyone if those powers are entrusted. These powers would be there curse but also a boon, which could be used to restrict many calamaties. And humans never get to know what things were averted but can only know & rememeber when these gaurds fail. Yes they fight among themselves but are these fights for gaining supremacy or to gain freedom from those things is still a mystery which none have been able to know it till now.\u201d I said.\nI would have said many more things but I was stopped by the sapphire eyed girl who pleaded me through her eyes to not say a word more and how could I utter a single word after that. My tongue was now tied with her plea so I let every other person to continue with the discussion and in no time the hour flee so did the students from the class.\nThis was the last class for the year and students would forget about all these talks is what I could wish for as many were worried about their individual exams or was excited for the farewell party of the seniors which the juniors had organised for. I don\u2019t know whether I blabbered more than required or was my speech revealed more than necessary things.\nPari responded \u201cHe started\u201d pointing all the blame towards me.\n\u201cI know who started what even I was here only. Now do you think about yourself Maan what were you doing talking all these stories.\u201d Geet turned towards me questioning but she was shocked and continued \u201cNow where did he go?\u201d as I was not there standing but had started to move out of the class saving my self from there questioning eyes.\nToday is the farewell party girls were dressed in red & white combination where as boys were in red & black combo. For a change juniors had planned to rag the seniors on there own farewell which was led by Pari & group, well I knew whose idea this would be. Time has changed so had the relations too in past 10 months seniors have become more friendly and supportive, thus playing pranks with them would not be a trouble and anyways they are leaving the institute so the coast is clear for fun.\nParty was in the open air hall in the grounds of the college which had a stage at one end where Geet was speaking to Pari who stood beside her with today\u2019s event manager & at the far end was the fountain where I stood gazing her every move. She looked angelic in that white salwar of hers as blue veil adored the slender creamy neck. Yash was running behind Pari helping her out with all his love and I was standing away from everyone feeling glad that atleast there are people whom I would love and they are infront of me.\nPeople dressed in vibrant colors were already to enjoy & have fun as the party was about to start. Whereas things don\u2019t happen as you wish for and who knows that better than me and exactly the way I had the intrusion there was a sudden hassle alround the place everyone were running into the college that\u2019s when I witnessed the tornado coming towards us.\nI stood waiting the tornado to come to me as what can it do to me carry & through me somewhere that\u2019s it right. However when it was just a yard away from the ground when it stood still as if something stopped its way. When I look around the ground there is no one present but my eyes stopped at one place where a girl lay may be unconscious and it didn\u2019t take a minute to know who that was as she is Geet only girl who was in her blue while everyone was in red & white.\nI flew away from the college far away from the place where I burnt her with my own flames as I was not able stand any more minute at that place; how long do I have to face the same thing again and again. Everytime when the sadness has engulfed me I have always consoled my heart that it isn\u2019t my mistake everyone has to go through these pains in their long-lasting life. Heavy as this heart feels now with the overwhelming emotions I stare at the Sun which is all set to take a dip in the vast expanse of ocean but now I have nothing to hold on to there is a deep stillness which has settled in me as the world has moved but I haven\u2019t.\nWith the increase in the pour even ocean seems to be more intended to swallow me within as I hit the first waves of the huge mass. It left me shocked as I could hold to anything, I felt like I am moving without my own will. Today there was only one will that was to try every possible way to put off this blaze. Even the thought has not left my mind I was hit by another way, now it seemed as if I was floating in it and next second I was submergered in it. I want to go deep into it so I tried to find the ground and started to walk into the depth of it.\nAs I stepped deep within my luck just flew away because the water which was soothing my soul just sweeped in making a space between me & the water mass. Same like Geet had created when we were in the college, was she here or was it someone else who possessed the same power. \u201cGeet \u2026\u201d my lips took her name as a whisper and just as that day today also rain which had been pouring stopped and my attention went towards the form in the shadows.\n\u201cYes \u2026 Maan we can but are you willing to be with me till the end. Will you love me without any of my ability to control water? Will you love me\u2026.?\u201d She replied with uncertainity.\n\u201cMaan, you need to let go this fear and worry nothing will happen to us. Yes, we will have to work hard to survive now.\u201d She pressed her ear to my chest while she continued \u201cBut together we will surpass every hurdle that comes in our way. This isn\u2019t yours anymore but mine now so stop troubling it.\u201d She said refering to my heart also showing her dominance over me.\n\u201cShh\u2026You don\u2019t have to voice it Maan, your face convey\u2019s it all, every thought that your heart analyzes, every notion it evaluates, every outcome it concludes. You are just as open book to me as I am to you.\u201d Geet declared her point.\nBy the time I was back Yash was up and had sat up against the rock as I hand over a bottle of water to him. He seemed surprised and undoubtly happy about something.\n\u201cYou guys are making fun of me and we are all worried for you. I wouldn\u2019t have been awake had I sleept last night, but after that storm had eloped you guys there isn\u2019t a place where we have not searched you. Today I thought lets look at the opposite direction too and here I found you guys.\u201d Yash explained the reason of his presence.\n\u201cCarry him, I can walk we will get more oppurunities going forward.\u201d Geet smiled winking at me.\nAnd today this diary answered me why I could never hear what they were worried about was that about the mess or about me contolling my powers as both could read each other face without voicing a word from their mouth. Today I am very happy reading that my parents too had powers like me, actually defeated the air power and that\u2019s why I their daughter am gifted with power of air.\nShe grew faster than we could think and tomorrow is her 18th birthday and I couldn\u2019t see her confused and worried anymore uncessarily too. Yes even her face revealed every secret of hers. And that\u2019s why I decided to place this diary in a place where she could get her hands on it.\n\u201cWhen were we separate from eachother Geet.\u201d Papa buttered Mama so easily.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T16:52:49Z", "url": "https://jeevanap.wordpress.com/incredible-fusion/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Oh my, I found my new preamp. This thing sounds Killer and very clear and natural. Not eq-ed and all colored up like most preamps on the market!!!! Very cool with the tone knob punched out you get the instrument direct with a wonderful smoothness and a volume control on the U5. It also has an engage button for the 6-position eq setting which is wonderful!!! I hat all the parametric color your sound crap. Why buy a wonderful and expensive instrument to never hear it. Ok anyway, I have been so happy with this thing that I had to come and post a thread to see who all is using or has used these and do you use it for an actual preamp?\nI have used it as a preamp before(though I have never actually owned it). It is killer! Easily the clearest and warmest sounding preamp I have played through. If I don't end up buying an iAMP head, I am going to go preamp power amp with the U5.\nIts awesome and so pure!\nAnyway, I'm working a few other avenues. They sound killer. I just need to get the rack ear's so I can install it in a rack with the Crest LT series which is a wonderful musical amp in it self!\nBrian, Just sell that Chamber fretless Benavente for $10,000 and you are all set for the avalon.

{"text": "After a four-week hiatus, the Verizon IndyCar Series roars back to life in the desert. What used to be Phoenix International Raceway is now called ISM Raceway. What does ISM stand for? Ingenuity Sun Media, of course. If that doesn\u2019t evoke fond racing memories, I\u2019m not sure what will.\nThe new name notwithstanding, IndyCar has a very rich history at Phoenix. AJ Foyt won the first Indy car race held at the D-shaped oval back in 1964. Of course, Foyt won all but three races in the thirteen race 1964 season so that shouldn\u2019t be a huge shock. In those days, the USAC Championship made two stops each year in Phoenix \u2013 generally at the beginning and end of the season. Lloyd Ruby won the season-ending race in 1964, long after Foyt had wrapped up the championship. Sadly, top-driver Bobby Marshman lost his life after a crash at Phoenix while tire testing there in late November of 1964 \u2013 just a few days after the race.\nSome of the biggest names in racing have won at Phoenix. Aside from the aforementioned Foyt and Ruby; names like Don Branson, Jim McElreath, Mario Andretti, Gary Bettenhausen, Al Unser, Swede Savage, Bobby Unser, Gordon Johncock, Johnny Rutherford, Tom Sneva, Rick Mears, Bobby Rahal, Michael Andretti, Arie Luyendyk, Emerson Fittipaldi, Helio Castroneves, Tony Kanaan and also the immortal name of Jim Guthrie \u2013 they\u2019ve all won at Phoenix. All kidding aside; except for Guthrie \u2013 that\u2019s a very impressive list that reads like a Who\u2019s Who of Indy car racing.\nPhoenix was reconfigured in 2010, mostly to handle the much heavier stock cars that prefer higher banking. The front straightaway was widened and the banking was slightly increased and converted to progressive banking. This will be the last time the track looks the way it does now. Next year, the seating will be completely different and the start/finish line will be between Turn One and the dogleg which is in what is currently called the backstretch. By moving the start/finish line, the numbering of the turns will be different as well.\nBut the biggest question looming over this weekend is whether or not IndyCar will even be back next year. This is the third year that IndyCar has returned to the 1.022 mile oval in the desert. If I\u2019m not mistaken, the current contract was a three-year deal. Track owner, ISC \u2013 a sister company to NASCAR, has a history of not being patient while IndyCar tries to build attendance at some of their tracks. Watkins Glen and Fontana have given IndyCar two chances at their tracks and the plug was recently pulled for the second time at both tracks. If this weekend\u2019s race is poorly attended, will that be it for Phoenix? If so, it hardly seems fair.\nThe date has been juggled since the series returned in 2016. It was early April two years ago, then due to the Final Four being in Phoenix last year, it was moved to later in the month. This year it returns to what is hoped to be a new traditional slot for many years to come.\nBut in order for that to happen, attendance must improve. For attendance to improve, fans need to be given a reason to come out. Quite frankly, the last two races at Phoenix have not given fans a reason to come out or return. To be kind, they have been snoozers. To be blunt, they have been stinkers.\nThe previous car in the aero kit era had so many wings and winglets all over them, they created a ton of turbulence in their wake. In short, it was very difficult for anyone to pass. The result was two years of boring one-mile processions. Experts last year told us that the new car would be much more racy at Phoenix. What we saw during February testing at Phoenix suggested otherwise. I\u2019m telling myself that it was a test when everyone was trying to emerge unscathed and that the race will be much different.\nLet\u2019s hope so. The Verizon IndyCar Series can\u2019t stand another clunker at Phoenix. They need a good race that will have everyone talking just like the race at St. Petersburg did four weeks ago. If they can see at least a decent crowd tomorrow night and a good race, the series may see a fourth year in a row at Phoenix. If Saturday night\u2019s race is a dud, this might be it at Phoenix for a while and that would be a shame.\nIndyCar needs to be at Phoenix. It is one of those tracks like Indianapolis and Milwaukee that is in the DNA of the series. It didn\u2019t upset me that much when Watkins Glen fell off the schedule last year, because IndyCar doesn\u2019t have a long history there. Since 1979, IndyCar has only run eleven races in that thirty-eight year span. Tomorrow night will be the sixty-eighth IndyCar race at ISM Raceway since 1964. That\u2019s a lot of history at one track to not be allowed to come back after the sixty-ninth.\nMy hope is a good race with a lot of twists and turns, to make people have to catch their breath when it\u2019s over.\nOne thing that might bring people out is the celebration of Mario Andretti\u2019s last IndyCar win. It took place twenty-five years ago in 1993 at Phoenix. Part of the celebration is the car that his grandson Marco Andretti will run, will have a livery very similar to Mario\u2019s Texaco-Havoline Newman/Haas car from 1993. The car looks good and a tip of the hat needs to go to Marco\u2019s sponsor Oberto. They have allowed the team to deviate from their colors and logos in order to replicate Mario\u2019s 1993 winner as closely as possible.\nSo who will win this sixty-ninth edition tomorrow night? S\u00e9bastien Bourdais was an early out last year at Phoenix, but that was no fault of his. Mikhail Aleshin decided to dive-bomb the field going into Turn Two. Bourdais was an innocent victim. I have to think that he\u2019ll do well tomorrow night.\nMy guess is that Team Penske will not stay silent two races in a row. Simon Pagenaud won here last season as Penske cars dominated the race. I\u2019m going with last year\u2019s season champ Josef Newgarden. He was rather quiet last month at St. Petersburg on his way to a seventh-place finish. I have an idea that Newgarden, nor his teammates, will not stay quiet two races in a row. I expect the defending series champion to come out swinging. Josef Newgarden will win the Desert Diamond West Valley Phoenix Grand Prix (that\u2019s a mouthful) tomorrow night.\nAfter this race, things get going for real. Next weekend the series travels to Long Beach, and two weeks from now they will be at one of my favorite tracks, Barber Motorsports Park in Leeds, Alabama \u2013 just east of Birmingham. After an off-weekend, there is the open test at IMS on April 30, which I may or may not be attending. Then the Month of May kicks off on Friday May 11 for practice for the IndyCar Grand Prix. Four days of practice on the IMS oval will be followed by two days of qualifying for the Indianapolis 500. The next weekend will be the 102nd Running of the Indianapolis 500. Then the series goes to Belle Isle and Texas before earning the next break in mid-June.\nBy then the four-week stretch we just went through with no racing will be a distant memory. After our teaser in March, I feel like IndyCar season is finally here for good. It\u2019s about time!\nThis entry was posted on April 6, 2018 at 4:04 am and is filed under IndyCar.\tYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed. You can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\nProbably one of the most anticipated races of the season for me. I think this race will be a true test of the new aero kit, if it puts on a good race here it\u2019s a strong sign they got things right.\nI watched the \u201993 Phoenix race yesterday and there was more passing in the first 25 laps than the last two IndyCar Phoenix races combined and even though the entire field was a lap down by lap 50 every minute of the race was thrilling and exciting. We need some of that magic tomorrow night.\nMy favorite bit of Marco\u2019s tribute paint scheme is the use of Circle K essentially in place of K Mart. Dig those red Ks.\nI\u2019m looking forward to this one if only for the mystery of how the new kit will race. I actually thought the test had a few moments where the cars looked to be racing more competitively than they did the last two years.\nI thought an Oberto was a good cigar. Turns out it is a good sausage. I\u2019m looking forward to other sponsorships of this genre.\nI am about to become an octogenarian. It would bring me (and A.J.) a great deal of happiness to see him do well over there in the desert Saturday. It has become apparent to me that I will likely not outlast Mr. Anthony Joseph Foyt Jr. and I may get black flagged in my sleep some night. With that in mind, I attached one of those IMS grandstand seats to my Acorn Stair Lift. Then I put Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d on my turntable, or the sounds of a Novi or Offenhauser, and ride up to bed each night. True dat.\nCongrats Ron on your upcoming birthday. Just watched Quali and Mr. Foyt looks well after his bee encounter.\nThank you young lady. I also watched Quali and Mr. Foyt does indeed look well.

{"text": "Flexibility trap \u2013 the effects of flexible working on the position of female professionals and managers within a corporate environment.\nemployee and managerial positions with the utilisation of flexible work arrangements in a corporate environment in the country with a full-time dominated work culture. The data represent a rare case study of the work environment in a Czech branch of one multinational company. In particular, this paper discusses conditions under which flexible arrangements are available and its impact on gender equality. The seven analysed interviews derive from a larger study on the corporate environment which included 35 interviews and a series of participatory observations. The data reveal the diverse and often subtle forms of discrimination of working mothers, who use the flexible working arrangement as a work-family reconciliation strategy. At the formal level, the part-time professionals are restricted in pay and in access to the company benefits. In the informal relations within the workplace, their work lacks of sufficient recognition of colleagues and superiors. Overall, part-time work for female professionals and managers leads to an entrapment between the needs of their family and the expectations of their employer. The research reveals the practical limitation in introducing work-life reconciliation policies. The results show the need to focus on promoting better conditions for employees working part-time. Also, it shows that managerial and highly demanding professional positions can be executed on a part-time basis if the work environment is open towards accepting this arrangement. Moreover, the findings outline the possibilities of developing workplace practices in the Czech Republic in a woman-friendly direction. Specific legislative arrangements should be enacted, providing better protection for employees in non-standard employment. The amount of research on female professionals working part-time or from home is rather limited in context of the post-communist countries.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T10:53:09Z", "url": "https://asep.lib.cas.cz/arl-cav/cs/detail-cav_un_epca-0443850-Flexibility-trap-the-effects-of-flexible-working-on-the-position-of-female-professionals-and-manag/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Are stoners now a target advertising demographic for fast food companies?\nEver since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast-food companies have become increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements.\nJuly 31, 2012, 1:48 a.m.\nBetween Taco Bell's \"Fourthmeal\" advertisements and Jack in the Box commercials featuring slow-talking stoners, it's hardly a secret anymore that fast-food companies are shamelessly targeting potheads with their ads. But have they crossed a line?\nOnce considered a taboo marketing approach, the fast-food industry today appears to have brazenly embraced the late-night munchies, according to The Fix. Although advertisements never blatantly refer to pot smoking, subliminal messaging has become more obvious.\nTake, for instance, this recent Jack in the Box advertisement. And Taco Bell has created a jingle to go with its latest string of advertisements, which sings of the \"late-night munchies.\" Of course, drive-thru windows open well into the morning hours also cater to the average midnight snacker, but there's little denying who the real target is given the choice of terminology.\n\"If you're targeting that heavy fast-food user, you need to speak their language,\" said Denise Yohn, a brand consultant who's worked with restaurants for 25 years, to The Fix. \"One way to do that is to talk about partying and munchies. To the mainstream audience it may just sound like late nights and drinking, but to a certain audience they're talking about getting stoned.\"\nIt's not the same thing as flagrantly endorsing the use of marijuana, of course. But the fast-food industry no longer appears to think the pothead subculture is off limits either. Perhaps they're just embracing a market force, but the strategy also runs perilously close to catering directly to a drug-induced appetite that drives people to consume their product.\nOf course, this wouldn't be the first time that the fast-food industry was accused of catering to addiction. Not only has fast food been proven to be highly addictive, but the industry actually hires scientists to design its food for exactly that purpose.\nWhether marketing to stoners crosses an ethical line or not, it certainly seems to be working. Taco Bell has seen its sales spike by 6 percent since launching its \"late-night munchies\" advertisements. The marketing has been so successful that at least one new upstart fast-food enterprise has decided to sell its line of frozen burritos directly to potheads. Drive-thrus of nearly every major fast-food chain now typically stay open past midnight, undoubtedly due to a steady profit margin.\nSo long as it works, it's not likely to change. In fact, without any backlash, it may not be long before advertisers compete explicitly for the stoner demographic.\n\"A lot of companies are skipping the innuendo,\" said Yohn. \"They think it's more effective to be overt. It creates more buzz. I think that's why you see a lot of advertising that seems unapologetically targeted to pot smokers.\"\nEver since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast food companies seem increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T02:40:12Z", "url": "https://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/are-stoners-now-a-target-advertising-demographic-for-fast-food-companies", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Mac McCorkle runs a bar and helps out his partner, who is a agent with the CIA.\nWhen McCorkle took his life savings and began to open a small pub in Bonn, Germany, after being discharged from the army, he wasn't looking for a partner. That didn't stop Mike Padillo from dropping in, handing him a check for half the value of the place, and telling Mac he could either accept the offer or see the opening delayed forever in red tape.\nKnowing he really had no choice, McCorkle accepted gracefully, albeit unhappily. To his credit, Padillo, forced by his own superiors to make the extortion, had the decency to be embarrassed.\nSo began the partnership between the two men, one that would quickly turn into a life-long friendship. Mike Padillo worked for the government (probably the CIA). When not on assignment, he helped run the bar, which grew over the years in success and made both a considerable amount of money. But every couple of months, he would show up, tell McCorkle he'd be gone for a while, and a week or a month would go by with him gone.\nSuch was the basis for the series which probably was never meant to be one. The ending of the first book made it pretty clear that was it. Then the book won for Mr. Thomas an Edgar for the best first novel of 1966. I'm sure that's when the publishers began to demand a sequel.\nThe sequel came the next year but this time Mr. Thomas apparently withstood the pressure for more and used his incredible talent on other ideas. Six books, including three in a different non-spy series followed before the pair of McCorkle and Padillo were heard from again. And then it would be 19 years more before the last in the series was written.\nThrough the years, the two unwavering qualities of this series remained the close friendship between McCorkle and Padillo and the terrific writing skills of Ross Thomas.\nMcCorkle discovers that his friend and partner has been sacrificed by his superiors in an exchange with the Soviets to get back two defectors. He realizes he is the only one willing to risk it all for Padillo.\nHappily married and living in Washington, McCorkle would have been happy to meet his old friend Padillo if McCorkle's wife had been kidnapped to force Padillo to kill someone.\nLong out of the game, both men are less than anxious to help protect the future king of a country rich with oil but Padillo owes a huge favor to the ones doing the asking.\nThe death of a CIA agent didn't raise too much of a fuss until it is learned he wrote a tell-all book which someone wants buried, possibly along with the agent's son who might have it. The son asks Padillo and McCorkle for help.\nA fellow spy-fiction fan and friend of mine was almost jumping for joy when he got his hands on \"The Backup Men\" in 1972-3, shouting, \"They're back! McCorkle and Padillo!\" You would have thought I'd slapped him by his expression when I asked, \"Who?\"\nAfter having the first book literally thrust into my hands later and reading the first few pages, I knew I'd never have to ask that question again. I was as hooked as my friend (thank you, Bob Walker, wherever you are!).\nIt isn't hard to understand why anyone who likes spy-fi would love this series. Mr. Thomas's skill as an author are without a doubt. The man won TWO Edgars. Most writers don't win any. He had two. And deserved them both handily.\nFurthermore, the characters are awesomely interesting and developed, the style is both exciting and wry, the locales are perfectly presented, and the plots just make sense. What more can you ask for, except more adventures.\nUnfortunately, Mr. Thomas' passing makes that impossible but I like to believe that McCorkle and Padillo are still out there, serving drinks and saving the day.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T20:56:01Z", "url": "https://spyguysandgals.com/sgShowChar.aspx?id=602", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "On another note, one of the upsides of moving is that you get to determine what you might actually need and what you might not need going forward. That\u2019s huge. Now the downside. As a prepper, you have a ton of stored clothes, boots, gloves, MOPPS gear, wheat, beans, rice, flour, etc, etc, etc. You get the picture. All of you you think you need, just in case\u2026 So, I looked it over, determined that some of the food could go, get donated, etc. I could replace it later, and I had enough long term storage to fill the gap if I needed it to. So that is where I am. But what was daunting was loading up buckets, buckets, and more buckets of food\u2026 I felt like it would never end. To boot, we\u2019ve moved from a place with a basement. You know, that cool dry place you\u2019re supposed to keep your food storage, to a home without a basement, but a crawl space. So all my food storage is in the warm humid garage at the moment, until I can figure out the next step, which may be a climate controlled storage unit. But that is not a perfect scenario either. I\u2019ll probably get an air conditioner for the garage and kill two birds with one stone, keep it cooler, and kill the humidity as well.\nThe other issue I have is organizing it all. I have a garage that is full of stuff still in boxes, and it really does need to be sorted out soon, as in the event of an actual emergency, I\u2019ll be wasting a lot of time doing things like digging out a propane heater or the generator that is currently buried. All of this takes time.\nBack to the move. I had originally planned on moving all my preps myself. I wanted a higher level of OPSEC. Reality kicked in though with some business travel and barely enough time to pack, so the preps got moved with everything else. That said, many preps were in cardboard moving boxes or in opaque plastic bins. The movers had no clue what they were moving. Other preps were in five and six gallon buckets clearly marked as wheat, flour, beans, and other types of long term food storage. Can you say oops. So much for OPSEC, as anyone that watched Doomsday Preppers or any other preparedness show would know exactly what it was. They asked, and I said I did a LOT of camping, and tried to reinforce it with my three various size tents, and many sleeping bags. I\u2019m not too sure they bought it.\nAs for guns, ammunition, gasoline, and other items a moving company prohibit, I did move myself the day before the official move. I didn\u2019t want anyone to see them or how many of them. Good thing the neighborhood we bought the house in is relatively quiet.\nWe\u2019ve been in the house now for almost five months. Everytime I look in the garage, I cringe at all the work there is to do. My mistake was not having a solid plan around moving and organizing my preps. Had I had the time, and access to the house early enough, I would have moved the preps earlier, organized everything, and felt more comfortable about it. Meaning, I really need to get my Bug Out Bag off the floor in the furthest corner of the garage so that it is accessible, get the generator out so that it is accessible, etc.\nThe moral of the story is, have a plan to stay organized, and stick to it if you plan on moving your preps to a new home or a new location.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T20:36:34Z", "url": "https://suburbansurvivalblog.com/prepping-and-moving-and-lots-of-stuff/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

When both you and your child have a long term vision, you will know the most helpful ways to empower your child. As you see them accomplish their goals, you will see how your role has been beneficial for them.\nKeep track of your child\u2019s accomplishments. This includes grades and exam scores, but also includes social accomplishments, caring for their community, investing in an outside interest, and acts of kindness that display integrity and character. No child gets it right all of the time, so when you are feeling frustrated by a particular behavior you can remember all of their accomplishments and see the growth and development they are experiencing.\nTeenage years are tender years and need to be navigated with extreme care. You are constantly figuring out how to communicate with your teenager and discovering what freedoms and boundaries they need. You are resolving conflicts and at times making necessary demands. This can be exhausting. Take time to engage in some activities you enjoy. Get plenty of exercise and sleep to help relieve stress. The better you feel about yourself, the more you will be able to empower your student.\nUltimately, make sure you are communicating with your child. You will know what problems they are facing and you will be able to empower them to solve those problems. Children that feel empowered, loved, safe and cared for will find ways to be successful in life.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T10:58:30Z", "url": "http://mrtestprep.com/empowering-parents-to-empower-their-children/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "How do companies innovate with big data? It starts with human-centered design thinking.\nAs the mom of a toddler, I spend most of my waking hours covered in a mixture of applesauce, milk, and general baby-themed liquids.\nBut it turns out, there are some clever ways to innovate with big data going on here. Coming from the 100-year-old clothing company L.L. Bean.\nL.L. Bean has teamed up with a variety of tech companies so that they can track data on how their garments are really used on an ongoing basis. Like how often each item is worn when it\u2019s washed, the temperature outside when worn, and more. Over the years, it will also show if an older garment is being used again, indicating a return to fashion.\nTheir key partner is Loomia, who makes flexible circuitry so the clothes can be fitted with sensors. Customers then have to agree to release their data to the blockchain, along with some basic information about their demographics like age, gender, and so on. The blockchain will be set up to keep this information anonymous.\nWell, it will probably work like a reward card system, whereby agreeing to give your usage data to the brand, you get free shipping or discounts. We\u2019ve seen this work many times. So, as long as the interface is really easy to use, people will happily release their data for free stuff\u2026we like free stuff!\nRight now, this data will be mainly used to innovate with big data and drive product improvements. By seeing what\u2019s being worn, how, where and by who, L.L. Bean will be able to leverage this information into the next round of clothing they create.\nThey will be able to see what types of usage reduce the lifespan or quality of the product. And then, either try to add protection against this use or just create a new line for that type of customer.\nSo, expect L.L. Bean to have a new line of \u201csweaters that your dog can sleep on\u201d and \u201cnon-wash pizza repellent shirts\u201d. One can only dream.\nHowever, this type of long-term data analysis is just the beginning. Smart clothing has a lot more applications than this.\nIf your jacket can sense the weather, then there\u2019s no reason that it can\u2019t react to it in some way too. And, unlike some internet of things devices, if you lose connection, it\u2019s not going to stop working as a jacket. This can all act as a bonus feature, rather than something integral to the functioning of the garment.\nBecause you don\u2019t want people getting soaked in the rain just because they lost WiFi, right?\nThere are many more ways to innovate with big data beyond this.\nIf you want to learn more about how you can leverage big data to inspire new products and services, then we\u2019ll be diving deeper into this innovative approach in our next video.\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I just need to find the remote control for my shirt.\nHow Can Big Data Drive Innovation?\nToday, we\u2019re going to see how to innovate with big data, especially when it\u2019s combined with a certain way of thinking.\nBecause data on its own is just a raw material. It\u2019s like having a ton of flour \u2013 it has value, but it\u2019s worth so much more when you turn it into a cake. Yummmmm, cake.\nSo, what can you bake from big data? The answer lies in the additional ingredient, design thinking.\nDesign thinking, born from the folks at international design firm IDEO, is a method of meeting people\u2019s needs and desires in a technologically feasible and strategically viable way.\nYou start by looking at what the customer needs. Rather than SOLELY focusing on profit margins and bottom line. You don\u2019t ignore these important factors, of course, that\u2019s just bad business sense. But in design thinking, you start with the customer needs and build from there.\nBig data, vs. survey data, is the information about people\u2019s actual behavior rather than what they believe their behavior is. This opens up the opportunity for real, groundbreaking innovation. Applied in the right way, this can unlock the real human-centered problem.\nFor L.L. Bean, collecting information like how often a jacket is worn, washed, or the temperature of the climate is the little data breadcrumbs that we leave behind as we live our lives.\nThe company can then follow the breadcrumbs to understand more about our behaviors. This is more telling than what you fill out in a survey or post on social media. It\u2019s beyond the \u201cedited\u201d response and rooted in real life activities.\nBut trying to innovate with big data is not just for big brands.\nYou might not have an army of customers wearing your brand\u2019s sci-fi pants, sending data to a cloud, but there are ways you can collect vital information.\nEven if you aren\u2019t an engineer or well-versed in mining big data, you can still practice using big data with design thinking.\nThe most obvious place to start is using website data from Google Analytics to objectively show the most important behavior patterns of users on a website. Once you understand what people are doing, you can work out why, and use this to find innovative solutions.\nIf you don\u2019t have your own website, don\u2019t despair, Google has a demo google analytics account available to everyone.\nAnd even though it\u2019s a demo, the data comes from the real Google Merchandise Store, which sells Google-branded merch. It\u2019s real numbers and real customer behaviors!\nYou can learn to apply your favorite algorithm, find valuable behavior insights, and all about the customer\u2019s needs through big data.\nBig data must be treated as the asset, not the byproduct. And anyone can find value in it if they learn how to look. When big data is paired with the human-centered design, that\u2019s where we uncover real innovation.\nIf you have any thoughts or questions about big data or design thinking then just drop us a comment below.\nThank you for checking out Start Within. Each week, we release videos focusing on the newest technology and innovation companies are launching.\nWe then go into some of the mindsets, tips, and solutions these companies employ to enable you to go out and launch new things, right where you are.\nDon\u2019t forget to subscribe on YouTube, and thank you for your support!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T12:18:12Z", "url": "https://start-within.com/ll-bean-innovate-with-big-data/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Last week the Police briefed the press about a grenade found on Banak Street in the City and promised an update on the investigations this week. Today however, police informed the media that they had found yet another grenade on Mayflower Street which intersects Vernon Street in Belize City. The discovery was made after authorities received a call at ten yesterday morning. Senior Superintendent Edward Broaster, Deputy Commander of the Eastern Division in Belize City briefed the press this morning. Here is audio provided by our Colleagues at KREM News.\nThe area it was found was under some bushes near a fence in an overgrown empty lot. The grenade was wrapped in several layers of plastic and police add that their intelligence suggests it was placed in the area about thirty minutes prior to them receiving the call. But there is the suggestion that officers of the police department are the ones planting the grenades.\nThere is also the growing fear, since the discovery of the grenade that there may be intent on detonating one such weapon in a crowded area during the upcoming September festivities. Authorities say they don\u2019t believe so.\nPolice also discovered a point 38 revolver that was also seized.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T05:05:40Z", "url": "http://www.ctv3belizenews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5221:another-grenade-found-in-the-old-capital-&catid=46:featured-news&Itemid=102", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Another pattern inspired by FlyFishFood.com. Very similar to their \u201cBelly Scratcher Minnow\u201d. You can follow the link to purchase the original version from Cheech and the gang. The signature feature of this fly is the tungsten weights tied to the belly that make the fly ride hook point up. This is a very useful technique that allows you to tie in various amounts of weight without using lead eyes. You can expect more sink than the \u201cNeutral Minnow\u201d because of this weight, but it will be both a subtle and level drop, instead of the jigging motion of a front weighted fly. Although this pattern is effective in still water, I prefer it in rivers as a strong pattern for both trout and smallmouth. For now I am offering it in three color combinations, but the options are endless. The almost neutral buoyancy of this fly is what gives it the lifelike movement of a bait fish. They don\u2019t look like much when they are dry, but get them wet and you will see what the fish like about this tasty meal.\nI tie this pattern primarily on tubes. I use a fair amount of ostrich plumes and a composite flash hackle for the body and under wing. Then I tie in a magnum rabbit strip and make a dubbing head using FlyFishFood\u2019s Bruiser blend.\nAll tube flies include an appropriate sized hook.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T04:22:52Z", "url": "http://michoutdoors.com/product/weighted-minnow-saltwater/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Use your hands to support women, children and youth who face injustice.\nI believe this applies to United Methodist Women today as well. So what\u2019s in our hands?\nI know what\u2019s in our hands: faith for seeking spiritual growth personally and guidance for moving forward in mission. What\u2019s in our hands is hope for making the world more just and peaceful for women, children and youth by training new leaders, expanding educational opportunities and working with United Methodist and other like-minded partners. What\u2019s in our hands is love from God for reaching out to sisters and brothers.\nWe have an awesome opportunity to hone our skills and educate ourselves for informed action at our annual Mission u events. This year our spiritual growth study theme is \u201cHow Is It With Your Soul?\u201d The text by Priscilla Pope-Levison and Jack Levison explores this question that is central to the history and development of The United Methodist Church. For the second and final year we will learn about the Roma of Europe in our geographic study.

My niece has apraxia, a speech disorder, and she lives not letting the disability stop her from achieving any of her goals. She loves to read, so I\u2019m always picking up Reading Program and other United Methodist Women resources for her to read. Also, one of the most awesome opportunities I\u2019ve ever had was to serve as a Special Olympics cheerleading coach.\nUnited Methodist Women, examine what\u2019s in your hands.

{"text": "The other night, while staying over at my in-laws\u2019 place in the countryside, my husband and I were just about to get ready for bed when it hit us.\nOh crap, we\u2019d left the laundry in the washing machine all afternoon. We\u2019d forgotten to hang it out to dry.\nWe bounded downstairs to the laundry room with flashlight in hand, and fully expected to spend 10 to 15 minutes doing what we should have done more than six hours ago.\nExcept, when I ran over to the washing machine, it was empty. Totally empty. And when I turned my head, sure enough, there was our laundry, neatly hung on clothes hangers on a bamboo rack.\nAs much as I felt relieved that I\u2019d been saved the trouble of doing that laundry this evening, a slight sense of guilt pricked me.\nOnce again, my mother-in-law had done housework for me. Housework I could have easily done for myself\u2026and should have done, given it was my laundry.\nIt\u2019s embarrassing to admit that I\u2019m in my thirties and still enjoy laundry assistance from my mother-in-law whenever we stay at her home in the countryside of Zhejiang Province. But it\u2019s true. This sort of thing happens ALL the time.\nYes, it\u2019s true. My mother-in-law has been known to hang up my clothing left in the washing machine\u2026and she\u2019s even done entire loads of laundry for us.\nHere\u2019s what usually happens. Either I put the clothing in the washing machine, but stupidly forget to hang it up on time (like I mentioned in the introduction). Or, my mother-in-law grabs my dirty clothing without telling me, and does the entire load for me (this happened ALL THE TIME when I stayed with my in-laws during the summer of 2011).\nSometimes, though, I do ask for her help. The other day, we were in a hurry to leave their house and I had just thrown a load of laundry into the washing machine. So I asked her if she could hang it and she said, \u201cNo problem\u201d with a smile.\nSo now you know one of my biggest dirty secrets.\nWhen we stay with my in-laws at their home, there\u2019s one thing we can count on \u2013 three square meals, all home-cooked by my mother-in-law. Always.\nThis is the complete opposite of how things work at my parents\u2019 home back in the US. There, the assumption is we\u2019re on our own and have to make our own meals (or buy them). Unless, of course, my dad or mom specifically asks us to join them for a meal (or invites us out).\nThe difference totally blew my husband\u2019s mind.\nAnyhow, here at my in-laws\u2019 home in China there\u2019s never any concern about cooking. Everyone knows that when it\u2019s lunch and dinner, my mother-in-law\u2019s voice will echo through the corridors \u2013 time to eat! \u2013 and we\u2019ll all come bounding down the stairs.\nIt\u2019s a strange place for me. I spent so many years handling all my cooking (and enjoying much of it). Now, when I\u2019m staying with my in-laws, I just show up to eat at the table.\nI have spent some time with my mother-in-law in the kitchen, learning how to cook from her. (She taught me how to make vegan Chinese-style flatbread, for example.) But in many ways, I feel foreign in her kitchen, a feeling that has nothing to do with my nationality, actually. After all, she uses a fire-powered wok to do the majority of her cooking, and I honestly have no idea how to manage the fire. Given how clumsy I am, I might just burn down the kitchen if I tried!\nNow that I think about it, maybe it is better to leave the cooking to a woman who won\u2019t cause a conflagration in the kitchen.\nWhen a friend of mine \u2014 also a Western woman with a Chinese husband \u2013 posted in a private chat about how guilty she felt because her mother-in-law gave her some cash to buy a new laptop (her old one crashed), oh, how I could sympathize.\nI thought about the many Chinese New Years that had passed since John and I returned to China in late 2013, and how his parents always gave us heaping hongbao filled with more money than adults in the family should have.\nI remembered how my mother-in-law handed over an additional stack of bills last year because my husband was starting his business (and she wanted him to have some \u201clucky money\u201d).\nI even thought of the numerous times when my mother-in-law spent money on us that she totally shouldn\u2019t have spent. Like buying those new coats for John for Chinese New Year (which prompted me to buy new clothes to make her happy). Or the comforter she bought for me to stay warm during the winter. Or even the way she purchased all of the basic necessities for our apartment in 2014.\n#4: We\u2019ve lived with my in-laws. A lot.\nIn America, the ultimate badge of adulthood is having your own place, separate from mom and dad.\nWell, the most embarrassing thing I could mention on this list is the fact that we\u2019ve lived in the same house as my in-laws \u2013 for long periods of time.\nEven now, we divide our time between an apartment in Hangzhou and their home. Heck, they added an entire suite to the house just for my husband and me, which proves how welcoming they are.\nIt\u2019s worlds away from America. I can guarantee you that if I asked my American friends and classmates, none of them would say that their parents or in-laws renovated their homes so they could live together. It\u2019s just not done there.\nAs embarrassing as it is to admit this, I have to confess I\u2019m also grateful. This suite they\u2019ve provided us is symbolic of the incredible support they\u2019ve given me and my husband.\nLife isn\u2019t always easy for John and me. But knowing that we have a couple of incredibly loving parents behind us \u2013 willing to do things that I\u2019m a little embarrassed to talk about \u2013 makes the hard times a little more bearable.\nIf you\u2019re all grown up, is there anything you\u2019re embarrassed that your parents or in-laws still do for you?\nLOL, you do laundry like Andy. Except I\u2019m willing to bet that you really do forget to collect it from the washer, whereas I suspect Andy \u201cforgets\u201d so I will finish doing the laundry for him.\nOnly problem is that he sometimes forgets to tell me he put in laundry while I\u2019m gone and it sits in the washer for days. MILDEWING!\nI don\u2019t get red envelopes. \ud83d\ude41 Jealous.\nWow\u2026 it\u2019s great you have so supportive in-laws.\nBut I don\u2019t think I could handle someone else doing my laundry and cooking. When my Filipino husband and I first got married, my sister-in-law kept taking over the cooking \u2013 she wouldn\u2019t let me do it and she wouldn\u2019t teach me how to cook Filipino dishes. This left me feeling totally useless as a wife, because I wanted to fulfill the role of taking care of my husband (an important element of the culture here).\nWhen we moved out and built our own home things radically changed for the better. We now have privacy and can really relax together.\nBut each to his own of course! You have done really well to adjust to such a profoundly different environment to that in America.\nThanks for sharing Hope! It was an adjustment \u2014 and as you say, it\u2019s certainly not for everyone.\nTrue that, typical Chinese parents, last time my girlfriend and I visited my parents , they took care of almost everything(of course, I, as an \u201ctypical\u201d Chinese kid, was and still am used to that), and before we left, she tried to give my girlfriend somethinkg like 5000 yuan.\nWow, that sounds a lot like my in-laws!\nYou\u2019re lucky to have such wonderful in-laws, especially with your mother-in-law cooking three meals a day.\nI don\u2019t have any trouble having someone wash my clothes. When I visit my youngest daughter (the cleanest one in the family) she washes my clothes with hers and brings them back to me folded.\nThat is sweet your in-laws were so welcoming.\nHey Jocelyn, great post as always! Just wanted to let you know I have also nominated you for the Blogger Recognition Award \u2013 thanks for being the grandmistress of AMWF blogs and thanks for introducing me to all the wonderful WWAMs in this world!\nAw, thanks for the nomination Laura, I\u2019m so touched! Yeah, it is great to be connected to all of these fabulous WWAMs!\nI share the four points with you, Jocelyn!(and it is, indeed, somewhat embarrassing). I see now that many Chinese in laws will do whatever it takes to spoil us. My father in law, for example, will sometimes go out early in the mornings to get us something delicious for breakfast, as well as \u706b\u9f99\u679c for me (my favourite fruit and utterly tasteless when I buy it imported in my country). He cleans, sweeps the floors, and generally keeps the house neat and spotless. He\u2019s like a cleaning hurricane, leaving no trace of the toys/crayons of our kids.\nMy mother in law, on the other hand, locks herself in the unbearably hot kitchen (in an already unbearably hot Nanjing) and cooks healthy meals, as well as doing other housework and taking care of my brother in law\u2019s little boy.\nNever, not even once, do they complain to anybody nor ask for gratitude. They fully sacrifice themselves in the most discrete way, but the effect of their actions is greater, like a sort of domestic \u201c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4e3a\u201d.\nWe\u2019ll be in China for the summer, ready to be spoilt rotten again (I feel guilty for that, already).\nYour in-laws sound so much like mine. (My father-in-law loves getting up early to buy tofu at the local market!) My mother-in-law is the epitome of sacrifice. Everything she does is for family and it\u2019s extraordinary.\nHave fun during your summer in China!\nMy wife\u2019s parents had long since passed away when we married, and her second mother lived with her fifth younger brother, so there was never a parent\u2019s home in the countryside. However, that never prevented the rest of the family showing us hospitality similar to that you describe. When we went to fifth younger sister\u2019s home in a compound for retired military, third younger brother\u2019s home in Alhambra, fourth younger brother\u2019s home in Monterey Park, or our \u201cch\u2019in chia (qin jia)\u201d stepson\u2019s wife\u2019s parent\u2019s home high up on the slopes of Kuan Yin Shan outside of Taipei, everyone went well out of their way to see that we were comfortable and well fed, and that I was never left out of the conversation with the language changed from Mandarin to Minnan.\nOur experience in China is a reflection on Western and American ideas of the individual and the community. A lot of the angst of young Americans may start with the separation anxiety forced upon us by our culture, that pushes us apart instead of drawing us in together, and by the pounding refrain of compete, compete, compete, which early on sets us against one another (Chinese usually wait until they get into business). Western philosophy\u2019s preoccupation with the individual over the group, existence before essence, alters our social relations everywhere we turn. Chinese would just laugh at Sartre and tell us the essence and existence go together.\nDon\u2019t be embarrassed about all this. Step back far enough to see both cultures in clear perspective. And next time post about all the things you have discovered you can do to return their kindness to your family.\nYou are blessed to be experiencing \u201cessence\u201d together with \u201cexistence.\u201d Enjoy.\nJames, thank you so much for the thoughtful comment. How lovely that your wife\u2019s family has been so hospitable towards you.\nYou make a good point \u2014 you have to wonder if America has it wrong in pushing kids out so early.\nGreat care from parents never end in China. But some time that leads to downfall of self-care ability of their children. Never grown up even in college.\nLooks like another Western woman joined the club here.\nThanks AG. Yes, there\u2019s a balance to be sure. Thank you also for sharing the news of the couple!\nI think it\u2019s interesting that somehow it is part of Chinese hospitality, right? Also, has to do with being family as well. Parents are still there to try to \u201chelp\u201d you out. I do agree of the embarrassment when your mother-in-law finishes your laundry. It\u2019s the same embarrassment I felt last year when my dad cleaned my bedroom at home when I lived at school. or when my dad folds all the laundry in the laundry room, including mine. T-T (only does this when he\u2019s tired of how messy the laundry room is.\nI can\u2019t accept money, maybe gifts. Every time my friend and I talk on the phone I argue with him and tell him I don\u2019t want him to pay for my round-trip flight from SH to CQ and he\u2019s telling me no worries. I eventually gave up.\nI think it\u2019s more of a mutual benefit, you help them out and they help you out, it\u2019s beneficial.\nJocelyn, I have been following your blog for some time now. Remember, I emailed you last year that I had read every single posts on your blog.\nI\u2019m not surprised that John\u2019s family has been so helpful and hospitable towards you. You deserve it.\nP/S There are meaty posts of substance on your blog; from yourself and other bloggers. Thank you so much for the share. I also enjoyed your post on 5 things you leart from the Chinese countryside etc. Life\u2019s simplest pleasures.\nLOL. So true! My parents still do our laundry, do all the dishes and cook for us whenever we visit them. They do the same when they come to visit us. Only exception is the laundry since they are not familiar with the washing machine we use. My mom always say, \u201cyou don\u2019t know how I clean dishes! I like it my way.\u201d It\u2019s tiring to argue with her. The money thing also. They always try to give us money. I was like, \u201cMom, we are the one making money now!\u201d oh well\u2026. guess it\u2019s a good problem to have!\nYour inlaws are so sweet! They feel like it\u2019s their duty to their son. I had the same experience when I was married to \u201cCai\u201d in that my inlaws sacrificed their happiness and well-being to drop everything to help us in the US. They kept telling me it\u2019s their duty. I know it helped us out a ton. But my mom also went way above and beyond and she\u2019s not Chinese. She quit her job when I moved back home so she could help me with Jake. My parents renovated their basement to add a bedroom and full bathroom so my uncle could move down there when Jake and I took over his room and bathroom upstairs. Parents show their love in many ways!\nWow, your mother-in-law actually uses a washing machine? My parents-in-law own a washing machine, but rarely use it. When we stay with them, my mother-in-law insists on doing my laundry as well, but by hand! She says she doesn\u2019t need a washing machine because \u201c\u6211\u5c31\u662f\u6d17\u8863\u673a\u201d (she is the washing machine). I have tried to stop her, but it\u2019s no use. Once when she was washing my clothes, she found a pair of my underwear had a hole in it, so she bought me new ones, talk about embarrassing!\nAwww I don\u2019t know if this is embarrassing! I think parents will always be parents no matter what (when I go home to visit and attempt to do my own laundry, my mom will scoop up my clothes from the dryer and fold them on my bed before I can even get to it!).\nIn America living with your parents until your early 30s isn\u2019t as taboo as it used to be (it\u2019s hard to stake out a living these days), so I think times are changing.\nI think my boyfriend and I will experience all of the above things with his Chinese in-laws sooner or later. They already cook and clean our house for us every time they come down to visit. I wish I could say I was embarrassed, but I\u2019m actually really happy to be spoiled once in a while!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T18:35:50Z", "url": "http://www.speakingofchina.com/china-articles/4-things-im-embarrassed-share-living-chinese-laws/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

If anything smells fishy, it is the design of this trial. Has it - as Pesticide Action Network UK says - been \"set up to fail\"? Many other effective alternatives exist, as PAN-UK point out, and are already in use in other European and UK cities.\n* Bristol's decision to trial vinegar as a weedkiller in place of glyphosate certainly grabbed headline-writers' imaginations, writes Harriet Williams. But with a wide choice of proven chemical-free weed control strategies available, might this experiment be \"set up to fail\"?\nIt's billed as an \"eco-friendly alternative\" to herbicides, but sadly it's not one that is tremendously effective for weed control in large public spaces.\nSo, has \"vinegar-gate\" left us any the wiser about what local authorities should be using for weed control?\nOur experience in speaking to people in Bristol is that many people are simply not aware that glyphosate is being sprayed in roads, housing estates, parks, and play areas. When they do become aware, the vast majority of people support an outright ban on this practice, or much tighter restrictions on its use. In the latest results of our rolling online survey, only 8.6% of respondents agree that herbicide sprays are a 'wholly acceptable' means of weed control.\nAnother respondent said, \"I saw a family out last autumn innocently gathering fallen leaves, and felt obliged to advise them to keep clear of the sprayed areas. No signs anywhere that this was going to be done.\"\n* It applies only to a small area of the city, and leaves the door wide open to the return of glyphosate should the trial be deemed a failure.\n* At the same time it invites failure by choosing vinegar ahead of more credible technologies for safer weed control.\n* Worse still, large tracts of land will not receive any weed control at all as the Council's regular spray contractors down tools for the duration of the trial.\nThanks to \"vinegar-gate\", more people know that local authorities have a problem when it comes to dealing with plants in the wrong places.

{"text": "Outsourcing often gets a bad rap, particularly from unions and job hunters, but according to Jacqui Miller, founder of Dynamic Business Outsource Solutions, one of the world\u2019s leading outsource companies with centres based in the Philippines, outsourcing is actually a positive thing to do that helps to accelerate business growth and financial wellbeing.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important to set the record straight and let people know that outsourcing, or rightsourcing as we call it, is an extremely sensible approach to business growth and operations,\u201d Jacqui said today.\nJacqui Miller knows what she is talking about. Having been involved in founding many start-ups in various industries including hospitality, marketing and travel, Jacqui understands the challenges businesses face when starting up and scaling to enable growth.\n\u201cRightsourcing is about selecting the right or best source of services that suits the business whether it be in-house or using outside third party services that virtually become an extension of your business,\u201d Jacqui added.\n\u201cOutsourcing has been around for some time in the business sphere, but has only been available to the big end of town. Now small to medium size business owners can also utilise these services giving their businesses a fighting chance to compete and grow.\n\u201cThe key to building and growing a small to medium size business or startup is working with the right people and making the most of the limited resources you have. Over the span of my career I\u2019ve seen the positive impact rightsourcing can have on the success of a business, whether it be a large company or small enterprise.\nThe Diversity \u2018The State of Offshoring 2017\u2019 research report identified that while cost pressures are the main factor driving businesses to offshore and offshoring plays a critical role in making businesses more competitive, it also has a positive impact on the economy as it allows businesses to compete globally and grow faster.\nThe report also states that in many cases, businesses leverage offshore teams to supplement their local employees by removing time-consuming and low-value tasks. Research conducted by leading organisations has identified that employees spend 80% of their time on low-value tasks, whereas they\u2019re only able to spend 20% on the tasks that grow businesses \u2013 dealing with client queries, providing a high level of service or working on strategic objectives aligned with organisational goals.\n\u201cBusinesses that rightsource are more confident financially because tasks that are not required to be done inhouse are undertaken elsewhere for much less cost \u2013 meaning the business has more money to invest in other places,\u201d Jacqui added.\n\u201cThanks to technology, rightsourcing is incredibly easy. People can work from anywhere as long as they have access to the internet and most businesses operate with cloud based systems whether they be for communication, accounting, sales, or marketing.\n\u201cMany business owners attempt to run all aspects of the business themselves, but this can be difficult if the business is new, the team is small, or the expertise isn\u2019t there. To grow and be successful, you\u2019ve got to share the load, especially with someone who can do it better and faster, and this often means working with experts in the field needed.\n\u201cRightsourcing enables small businesses to compete and grow by reducing wage costs and increasing productivity. It gives businesses, especially start-ups, the two most important aspects needed for success: more time and money.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T20:22:22Z", "url": "http://www.businesses.com.au/money?start=3", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Vernal presents a selection of new multi-media works that use stories, myths, and legends passed down from various cultures to explore ideas related to, among others: spring and renewal; cycles of life and changing seasons; love and loss; life after death; and flowers. Stories taken directly from Greek mythology that explain the creation of spring flowers like hyacinths and narcissus, and from Norse mythology and the legend of Valhalla are examples that are used as points of departure for personal investigations of the exhibition\u2019s themes. By freely combining parts from these various stories, sampling and altering visual references from historic sources, and layering in elements that reference my own personal interpretations and affinities with the stories\u2019 various characters, I seek to introduce new perspectives and offer viewers new points of access from which to enter these timeless tales.\nThese works, which amount to a series of fractured narratives, made alone and under the name bourbon, in collaboration with Loretta Bourque, are extremely personal and distinctly colored (stained)by recent events in my life. These challenges have made me question my very foundation, and at times have prevented me from moving the work forward, but ultimately they have lead me back to the exhibition\u2019s central themes with a renewed focus. I acknowledge that in making this work I am borrowing freely from the mythologies of cultures outside my own. I respect the fact that the juxtaposition of imagery and iconography from various religious sources may create tension within the work and even with some viewers, but this is not a primary goal, rather a byproduct of my working process, which is by nature collaborative and uncensored. I am indebted to the many artists who have explored the show\u2019s themes before me, and from whom I have borrowed and quoted liberally. I offer these works in homage to them, and as tribute to those who in leaving this world have given me great cause to complete them. It is also with much gratitude I dedicate this exhibition to my family and friends who have given me the space and time I have needed to begin to see again the first green of spring in every challenge; and a sense of renewed optimism that comes to me like when I see the first crocus of spring or get a whiff of the almost-too -much smell of hyacinths at their peak. If I have accomplished nothing else in this work, I hope that in sharing the beauty of a single flower, that I might spark a light of hope in someone else who might be struggling to see that the part of them which they think they may have lost is still there. Like a spring flower, it has only been laying dormant, waiting for the perfect moment to re-emerge and bloom again for all to see.\nI am a writer of letters. For me, written correspondence permits a naturalness of expression \u2013 of intimacy, connectedness, and affection \u2013 that is different from communication through technological means. The letter writing tradition also plays a vital role across my creative practice, and my current work is based upon on it.\nFor these works, I began by writing love letters between a fictional woman invoked from another plane, and me. The letters share both the mundane and the precious \u2014 as love letters, they build an intimate vocabulary. Marked by the dates, the repetition of such an interchange captures not just the passage of time, but an evolution of two hearts merging. Once transcribed, the letters are torn apart and woven into the painting; small sighs amid the intensity of texture and the energetic gestures of blue paint.\nThey are blue for a reason. What that reason is, I still don\u2019t know.\nAlthough my painting has included the same themes for many years, I did not begin to include love letters until 2018.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T16:35:36Z", "url": "http://www.thevisualist.org/2019/04/rob-bondgren-ara-lucia/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "New York, NY - January 15, 2014 - Today, U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer announced that he has received a commitment that John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) will be assigned additional customs agents as the result of increased appropriations for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as part of the Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations bill. This bill has boosted CBP\u2019s funding by $165.7 million in order for the agency to hire 2,000 new agents nationwide. Specifically, the bill increases CBP\u2019s overall budget to $10.6 billion, which is over $220 million more than FY2013. Schumer explained that $165.7 million of the new funding was explicitly prescribed \u201cfor the purpose of hiring, training, and equipping new U.S. customs and border protection offices.\u201d During a confirmation hearing today, Schumer secured a commitment from Gil Kerlikowske, who is currently undergoing the confirmation process to be Commissioner of CBP, that he would commit to bringing an adequate portion of these new agents and resources to JFK once he has been confirmed.\nIn September 2013, Schumer made an appeal to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to implement new measures that would help alleviate incredibly long lines for travelers using customs at JFK and he continued his push at a confirmation hearing today for Kerlikowske. Schumer\u2019s appeal comes after a report revealed that customs lines at JFK Airport were among the longest wait times in the country. According to the report, the average delay during peak hours could be two hours or more.\nOn July 1, 2013, at 6 am, the wait was 140 minutes.\nOn August 3, 2013, at 4 pm, the wait was 120 minutes.\nOn August 24, 2013, at 4 pm, the wait was 3 hours.\nSchumer has long advocated measures to decrease these wait times, including a personal call in September to then-Acting DHS Secretary Rand Beers, during which Schumer asked Beers to approve and install new automated Passport kiosks, as well as assign additional Custom and Border Patrol agents at JFK. Schumer also urged his colleagues to boost funding for the Customs and Border Protection in the Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations bill, above the current 2013 levels and called current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson to press his case.\nToday, Schumer announced that the recently released appropriations agreement called for $165.7 million to hire 2,000 new agents nationwide, and that he has received a commitment from Gil Kerlikowske that, when confirmed as Commissioner of CBP, he will assign an adequate portion of these new agents to JFK.

{"text": "Amid a contentious government shutdown, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has written President Trump a letter, suggesting that in lieu of delivering a State of the Union speech, as the president intends, he submit his address in writing.\nAlthough Americans today are accustomed to seeing the president deliver the SOTU, Pelosi notes in her letter that \u201cduring the 19th century and up until the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, these annual State of the Union messages were delivered to Congress in writing.\u201d Pelosi also notes that a SOTU has never been delivered amidst a government shutdown.\nAlthough the State of the Union started as an oral address\u2013both George Washington and John Adams delivered speeches to Congress\u2013Thomas Jefferson was the first to balk at the tradition.\nJefferson had several reasons why he believed a written address was superior to a speech. First of all, the third president nursed a fear of public speaking. He also believed that a letter was more efficient than a speech\u2013that it would take less time to read than to listen, and that a written document would give legislators time to think about their response. Historians have also noted that giving a speech had a king-like aura, something that a republican like Jefferson would abhor.\nThen again, Jefferson could have simply found trudging to Congress to give a speech inconvenient.\nIn any case, the tradition that Jefferson set remained for over one hundred years, until Woodrow Wilson decide to return to the ways of Washington and Adams, and give a speech before Congress instead of simply sending a letter.\nSince then, a spoken SOTU has indeed become a national habit, even more so than in Wilson\u2019s day thanks to mass communication tools like radio, television, and internet.\nThat\u2019s not to say that the written version of the SOTU has been abandoned entirely\u2013as lame duck presidents, Truman, Eisenhower, and Carter chose to submit a written message instead of giving a speech before Congress.\nWhether or not Trump will heed Pelosi\u2019s advice has yet to be seen, and certainly a president might balk at giving up the bully pulpit power of television. In any case, we\u2019ll leave you with a cartoon of Theodore Roosevelt, who was thoroughly dismayed that Wilson had the idea of a SOTU speech, something that Roosevelt himself would have enthusiastically embraced.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T02:13:30Z", "url": "https://history-first.com/tag/sotu/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

When the BMEWS program started, he designed magnetic drums and discs for that project, and later was responsible for design of the TRADEX tape transport. During design of the precision tape recorders for Bell Labs, he was responsible for the mechanical design.\nMr. Uritis holds 8 patents in the recorder field.\nBENJAMIN A. COLA graduated from Drexel Institute in June 1950 with a BSEE. At this time he joined RCA and worked on the design of power supplies, video circuits, TV airborne cameras, naval radar tracking equipment and servo mechanisms in the Special Devices Department. A period of one year was spent on systems analysis of shoran bombing and reconnaissance equipment. He received an MSEE degree in June 1955 at the University of Pennsylvania. In August 1955 he was transferred to the newly formed Missile and Surface Radar Section, where he worked on analog data processing assignments for TALOS, ATLAS, BMEWS, DAMP, and TRADEX. His most recent assignment was design project engineer on the development of a precision high speed tape recorder.\nThis multiple-channel, wideband precision tape recorder was developed as a basic element in a tracking radar system to be used in multiple target environments. All signals received by the radar tracking the target in real time are tape recorded. Thus, all targets viewed by the radar during a \"live\" exercise can be repeatedly acquired, tracked, and analyzed through playback at a later date. To permit recovery of maximum information, data is recorded in the form of unprocessed radar IF signals; then on playback, the optimum signal-processing system recovers each target parameter of interest.\nRadar target parameters such as range, doppler, and angle position must be measured precisely; at the same time, target resolution and relative amplitude must be preserved. Such performance requirements impose challenging demands on a radar tape recorder - particularly signal-to-noise performance, gain and phase tracking between channels, gain linearity, transport velocity stability, and interchannel jitter.\nFig. 1 shows the complete radar tape recorder designed to meet these standards of performance. The radar tape recorder provides 15 channels with a bandwidth capability in excess of 6 Mc; the recorder operates at a tape speed of 1,180 ips and a velocity stability of better than 1 part in 105. The recording time is 6 minutes. The radar system utilizes these capabilities to record 8 channels of 3.5 Mc video radar signals along with 7 wideband channels of timing, digital, and other reference signals for processing by the radar in serial form.\nThe radar tape recorder (Fig. 2) stores ungated if information from the uhf and L-band receivers so that during subsequent playbacks, targets can be acquired and tracked in angle, range, and doppler.\nThe receiver-exciter sends repetition rate pulses to the UHF and L-band transmitters where the power is stepped up and sent to the antenna for transmission. The receiver-exciter receives the returns from targets and sends them to the tape recorder and tracking receiver.\nThe tracking receiver (in conjunction with the range tracker) tracks targets in angle, range, and doppler during real time or from tape playback. The tracking receiver also provides agc, scintillation, doppler, and range information to describe the target to the data recorder. The tracking receiver also provides azimuth and elevation errors to the angle servos that drive the pedestal, keeping the antenna on target during live track.\nBy recording the radar returns on tapes, it is possible to separate and analyze the targets of a missile shot as many times as desired and, thereby, effect an economy of radar systems and missile firings.\nBased on the principal radar requirements of Table I, specifications for the radar tape recorder were determined. Requirements for frequency and polarization diversity and for monopulse angle tracking resulted in a need for eight signal channels. Range and doppler accuracies were improved through the use of a recorded if reference signal and a range clock signal. Additional channels were used for a transport servo-speed reference, pedestal angular position data, and time-of-day codes - resulting in a 15-channel machine (see chart of Table II).\nThe principal specifications for the radar tape recorder are Table III. Reasons for some of these specifications are described herein. The signal-to-noise (S/N) specification is dictated by the desired system dynamic range. Velocity stability is necessary to assure doppler tracking accuracy as well as to minimize the occurrence of spurious signal spectral lines due to transport velocity modulation. Gain and phase track specifications assure accuracy in the measurement of target angle offset.\nGain and phase linearity maintains good target resolution by avoiding pulse distortion or distortion echoes. Low interchannel jitter is important in measuring accurately the signal polarization vector, range, and angle. Bandwidth is determined by the radar pulse characteristic; at the signal input to the recorder, the pulse is in the form of a cosine squared.\n1) Gain linearity and gain tracking are very difficult to achieve in an am system because of the effect of the nonlinear magnetization characteristic of the tape and because of variations in tape sensitivity.\n2) An fm system minimizes the effects of tape drop outs, variations in sensitivity of the magnetics and am variations introduced by changes in the effective head-air-gap with tape pressures. Good gain linearity can be achieved by frequency modulators and demodulators.\nThe choice of FM recording results in the disadvantage of greater circuit complexity because of the above requirements for frequency modulators and demodulators and also the need for more bandwidth than that in an am system. In fm, the bandwidth required to pass the sideband frequencies depends on the desired S/N performance, and on a minimum fm carrier frequency that prevents fold-over of the side frequencies. The final choice resulted in a 4.5-Mc fm carrier frequency with significant sideband frequencies extending from 0.2 Mc to 8Mc.\nThe 8-Mc bandwidth required that the relative speed between tape and head exceed a minimum value determined by the magnetic head gap-length. Since head gap-length could not conveniently be made less than 40 microinches (0.000040 inch), a tape speed of 1,180 ips was used; at this speed, 6 miles of tape are required to provide 5 minutes of recording time. Because of the requirement for multiple channels, longitudinal recording was chosen.\nThe basic design criteria for the tape recorder were established, based on a consideration of signal-to-noise, gain tracking, gain linearity, bandwidth and multiple channel capability.\nSatisfying the requirements for velocity stability and interchannel jitter depended to a large extent on the mechanical perfection of the tape transport and the performance of the servo speed control. The main elements of the transport are shown in Fig. 3. The recorder components are assembled to a jig plate which is accurately aligned and attached to a rigid frame to assure a precise tape path. The complete assembly is shock-mounted within its cabinet.\nThe 5-minute recording requirement resulted in 30-inch-diameter reels weighing 50 pounds and containing 6 miles of 1.1-mil magnetic tape plus 2,500 feet of clear leader at each end. The tape is accelerated to full recording speed in 60 seconds and is stopped in the same time. The reels are equipped with quick-disconnect knobs to facilitate fast reloading and permit uninterrupted recording with two transports. Tape guides and tensioners are air lubricated so that frictional contact to the tape occurs only at the capstan edge-guide and at the magnetic heads.\nRemote control of recording, subsequent repeated playbacks, and rewinds dictated that the tape remain threaded and taut during and following each run. To accomplish this, programmed acceleration and deceleration cycles were employed at the start and end of the tape runs. A length of clear polyester leader is attached to each end of the tape; transitions from clear leader to tape are sensed photoelectrically to initiate the program.\nThe capstan-head assembly of Fig. 4 is designed for quick replacement by utilizing an air manifold which automatically seals upon installation of the capstan. Two blocks of magnetic heads, one an 8-track and the other a 7-track are supplied by the RCA Broadcast and Communication Products Division. Heads are prealigned on arms for fast replacement once initial adjustment of the head arm support has been made.\nTo achieve constant tape speed, the capstan assembly employs an air-turbine drive and hydrostatic air bearings. Capstan speed is sensed by a tone wheel and controlled by a hysteresis brake; both are integral parts of the capstan shaft. To minimize longitudinal vibrations, the tape is stabilized by making simultaneous contact with both the capstan and the heads. Since the tape is not perfectly smooth nor of uniform thickness, it is necessary to relieve the capstan surface behind the area where the heads contact the tape.\nThe velocity stability specification of 1 part in 105 imposes a severe runout requirement on the capstan assembly; the angular velocity generates flutter components of 87cps and higher multiples which are above the bandwidth of the capstan-servo correction capability.\nTherefore, the dynamic runout of the capstan must be held to less than 20 microinches; it is done by using the ultimate in precision grinding, hand lapping, and dynamic balancing. An additional benefit in reducing the effects of capstan runout is derived from depressing the heads into the tape a*bove the capstan grooves; thus, the heads may be firmly positioned at a fixed radius from the rotational axis of the capstan. Head contact pressure is controlled by a very precise adjusting screw which advances the head only 5 mils per revolution. Pressure applied is measured as an increment of the capstan hysteresis brake current.\nMechanical resonances throughout the tape path produce variations in tape tension, resulting in minute (but not inconsequential) variations in tape velocity at the capstan. Such variations can be caused by improper tape guide design, or by insufficient damping where resonant systems exist in the tape path, as at the tape tensioners. Since these effects are not necessarily uniform, or in-phase across the width of the tape, they produce the undesirable effect defined in the specifications as \"phase jitter.\" The allowable phase jitter between signals (recorded half the width of the tape apart) is \u00b120 nsec; this corresponds to roughly a differential displacement of 24 microinches.\n4) precise alignment of all tape guides.\nCompressed air, supplied by a remote unit at 100-psi nominal pressure, operates the transport. Air is oil free and dried to -40\u00b0F dew point. Outlet air-supply filters and filters at the air inlets to the cabinet and to the capstan air-bearing line protect the air-pressure regulating valves and the close-fitting capstan bearings. In the event of a compressor failure, a reserve air supply brings the transport to a safe halt.\nPressure-sensitive switches are set a few pounds below the lower limit of the normal pressure variation range of the air supply. When the air-supply pressure falls below a predetermined value, turbine air is cut off and the transport goes into its programmed stopping cycle. Mechanical brakes on the reel spindles stop the reels quickly to minimize tape spillage in the event of a power failure or loss of tape tension.\nEach tape reel is belt driven by a two-phase 400-cps induction motor and controlled by an independent servo system. The control signal for the reel servo loop is obtained from the tape sensor device nearest the particular reel involved (see Fig. 3). The stator of the induction potentiometer is excited by an AC reference supply and produces an error signal proportional to the velocity error of the tape at the reel. The Ac-induced voltage in the rotor, which is the error signal, is amplified and applied to a carrier-referenced demodulator; then, the dc output of this circuit is used to drive the operational amplifier shown in Fig. 5.\nAn additional feedback loop is provided by an AC tachometer on the servo motor shaft. The 400-cps signal is demodulated to dc to make it compatible with the tape error signal; it is easier to realize the proper stability networks in the dc domain, and AC quadrature problems are completely eliminated - providing a more stable design with less effort.\nThe tachometer feedback signal is combined with the tape speed-error signal in a summing operational amplifier to compensate for the non-linearity of the magnetic amplifiers which are as the servo power amplifiers. The summing operational amplifier output is the servo control signal used to drive the magnetic amplifier; the magnetic amplifier controls the 400-cps power supplied to the reel servo motor.\nThe capstan servo drives the tape with highly precise speed control by two servo loops: one a frequency lock, and the other a phase comparison control to obtain high sensitivity (Fig. 6). Pulses derived from the capstan tone wheel and proportional to tape speed are passed through a 400-usec delay line; capstan speed is varied by the servo until the pulse frequency corresponds with the delay of the line. The 400-usec delay line is equivalent to a tone-wheel frequency of 2,500 pps (this servoing of the capstan speed to near synchronous value is called a frequency lock). When a frequency lock occurs, the phase of the reference 2,500 pps begins to zero beat with the tone wheel; thus, a phase error is produced which adjusts the capstan speed to a full phase lock.\nThe phase detector producing the speed-control signal is extremely sensitive; the slightest change of capstan tone-wheel frequency results in a considerable phase error. Once the capstan servo is locked in, complete control of the speed is maintained by the phase loop. The basic speed control of the capstan driving the tape is obtained by applying air pressure to the capstan turbine. The turbine air pressure would drive the capstan at a speed much higher than needed; however, the servo controlled hysteresis brake reduces it to the desired value.\nThe capstan speed is locked to a crystal oscillator by servoing the tone wheel during the record mode. During the playback mode, the control track, a recorded 2,500-pps reference frequency standard, is servoed to the same crystal oscillator. The slight difference between the capstan speed and the tape speed is removed by this playback servo technique. Electronically variable delay lines are used in those channels requiring additional velocity refinement corrections to the radar data (Fig. 7).\nThe technique of comparing the playback of a recorded 2,500-pps crystal clock with the same crystal clock and using the resultant error voltage to drive the capstan cancels out all low-frequency speed variations of the tape. However, this method does not remove high-frequency components of speed variation resulting from such sources as capstan asymmetry and high-frequency tape flutter. The capstan turns at 87 cps and introduces Fourier series tape-speed components 174 and 261 cps in both record and playback modes; such components cannot be servoed out because of the limited response of the capstan. To remove the effects of the capstan asymmetry and other speed deviations, electronically variable delay lines are inserted into all channels that need precision speed stabilization; a control voltage advances and delays each channel of data in order to make the tape information appear to be coming from a perfectly constant speed tape.\nThe control of these electronically variable delay lines is accomplished with the closed-reference automatic-time-correction (atc) loop of Fig. 7. When the capstan servo has locked in, the reference playback signal averages 2,500-pps - but there will be expansions and contractions of the pulse periods for the reasons previously described. This reference playback signal is inserted into an electronically variable delay line that removes the high-frequency speed variations. The tape-playback 2,500-pps reference is compared to the clock-reference 2,500 pps in a phase detector; the resultant error signal changes on a pulse-to-pulse basis. This error is amplified and the atc loop stabilized by passing the signal through an operational amplifier with the proper transfer function.\nThe resultant amplified error output is used to drive the reference delay line, completing a closed loop. It is apparent that the error signal created will advance or delay the playback pulses to slave them to the clock-reference 2,500 pps by removing the high-frequency components of flutter. At this point, the 2,500-pps reference passing through the delay has had the stabilization of the capstan servo control and the atc servo electronic correction. The signal that drives the reference delay line also drives the six signal delay-lines because the speed correction required is approximately the same for all channels.\nThe interchannel jitter must be small in order to make this type of delay line correction effective; moreover, this condition is assured by meticulous design of the tape transport. There must be very little phase jitter between channels, since the correction signal of the atc servo loop is not only applied to the reference line, but also (as an open-loop correction) to all of the signal delay lines.\nTo measure intertrack jitter during the mechanical development of the tape transport, the precise measuring technique of Fig. 8 was used. It consists of recording a 1.5-Mc sine-wave signal upon the two tracks in question, playing these channels back, and then mixing them down to 200 kc. The exchange of phase angle between the two signals remains the same at 200 kc as it was at 1.5 Mc, and it can be handled by a commercially available phase meter. The output of the phase meter was observed on a scope, spectrum analyzer, and pen recorder. A typical pen recording of the intertrack phase jitter is shown in Fig. 9.\nThe most interesting aspects of the signal electronics for the radar tape recorder relate to the problems of linearity and bandwidth in the precision fm channels. Fig. 10 shows the elements of a typical \"fm\" channel. In the record mode, the signal in the form of radar video pulses is converted to an \"fm\" signal in a modulator. It is then amplified in a record amplifier which drives the record-playback head as a constant-current generator. On playback, the signal is amplified in a preamplifier and then in a playback amplifier which includes aperture equalization to compensate for the magnetic-head frequency response characteristic. The signal is then reconverted to a radar video signal in the frequency demodulator.\nThe bandwidth required in an fm system is dictated by the rise-time requirement; the system S/N ratio is a function of this bandwidth.\nFrom this expression, it can be shown that a peak frequency deviation of 1.5 Mc achieves S/N performance greater than 40db assuming that the ratio of peak carrier to rms tape noise per megacycle is 48db.\nThe radar tape recorder was designed to record radar pulses with a video bandwidth of 3.5 Mc; for the frequency modulation of these signals, a 4.5-Mc carrier was used to minimize the effect of \"fold over\" (side frequency terms) in the fm signal.\nThe primary problem of equalization is related to the need for compensating the amplitude-versus-frequency response of the magnetic playback process. The flat amplitude and linear phase responses required to meet the performance specifications for the radar tape recorder were achieved. The following equation, however, shows that the amplitude response of the playback process is not flat and further that the phase response is linear. Therefore, the equalization must compensate for the amplitude response of the playback process without introducing a nonlinear phase characteristic.\nAnalysis of the magnetics problem results in the following equation for the output voltage from a playback head, assuming a sinusoidal recorded flux on the tape.\nTwo tape recorders have been in continuous operation on the pacific missile range for almost a year and have recorded and preserved much valuable data for further analysis and evaluation. The advanced techniques employed have proven invaluable in the study of missile re-entry.\nCredit for work on the original Tradex tape recording system, which was a forerunner of the high-speed precision tape system described in this paper, is due to H. R. Warren and his associates in the DEP Communications Systems Division.\nAlso, credit for magnetic head design is extended to the Magnetic Head Development and Design Group of the Broadcast and Communications Products Division, under the direction of B. F. Melchionni. This project was completed successfully because of the tireless efforts of many people with varied skills.

{"text": "For many manufacturers, compressed air is often extremely expensive.\nOn average, compressed air costs can consist of up to 50% of the total electric expenditure of a large manufacturing plant \u2013 adding up to millions of dollars per year.\nOur fundamental approach at Bay Controls is to work with you to reduce your compressed air system energy usage and, in turn, bring you predictable and reliable energy savings of 10-13%. This approach is based on several core strategies.\nOur controllers use powerful microprocessors to collect and analyze critical compressor monitoring points up to 100 times every second. Through this industry-leading combination of power and data, we can recognize and react to even the smallest changes in air system conditions faster than any other systems out there.\nAs a result, Bay controllers consistently maintain pressure within a narrow 1-2 psi band and enable pressure set points to be lowered while still reliably maintaining the minimum required system pressure. Lowered pressure points bring about immediate and substantial savings.\nAccording to the Department of Energy, the average compressed air system loses between 10-30% of its air due to leaks. Our focus is at Bay Controls to reduce potential leaks and translate that into lowered costs.\nSince our controllers enable lower pressure set points with precise pressure control bands, they also drastically reduce the amount of lost and leaked air.\nMany control systems don\u2019t have the ability to automatically start and stop as plant air demand changes. The result? Air compressors often run continuously and unloaded for long periods of times.\nBay controllers allow you to schedule your air when you need it, matching your air supply to your demand based on your plant\u2019s production. You can reduce unnecessary run time and save energy overall.\nAs an energy solutions company, Bay Controls is often included in the custom incentive programs that investor-owned utilities (IOUs) offer their customers. IOUs are focused on reducing energy consumption, and our systems and solutions are the perfect way to achieve these goals.\nIf you\u2019re considering doing any energy projects at your facility and are eligible for a custom incentive program from your IOU provider, we can offset the project costs and have a faster ROI on any investment(s) you make.\nWould you like to learn how you can save up to 10-13% on your total energy spend?\nSchedule a 5-minute discovery call with the Bay Controls team!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T02:00:18Z", "url": "http://baycontrols.com/resources/energy-savings/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Week 2 weigh in this morning and I have lost 10lbs!!\nGreat job! This is amazing! Keep up the amazing work!\nWay to go on your 10 Lbs loss!! Yahooo!!! Keep on, keeping on!!\nSo had a very rough week with staying on track, not only did the long weekend trip me up, I was craving everything under the moon this week and struggled everyday. My weight fluctuated a lot this week and was back up to 278 but this mornings \"official\" weigh in is at 272 which I can live with because my cravings were caused by TOM which finally came on Friday, so hoping that by staying on target next weeks weigh in will be at least 265. Now that it is the weekend I have to be especially strong because at least during the week I have routine because of work that help keeps me on track. The carnival is also in town and we took the kiddo last night and she had a blast, I had worked yesterday to make sure I had enough cals left and had a great workout so I didn't feel guilty having a corn dog, which I order the small one and that was more than enough to satisfy the craving. On the way out of the carnival the family wanted deep fried oreo's which are just as horrific for you as they sound, but we always get them, just happens this year I am trying to lose weight, but we still got them and I had one so that is over and done with. Kiddo wants to go back today and I will take her since she has some tickets left but not getting any food today, but we might if we get in a really good workout get an ice cream cone. I decided I am not going to get rid of all the things in my life that I enjoy, I just have to learn to moderate and to workout to burn it off. I have cut out a lot of the unnecessary crud that is so harmful and I have started eating breakfast and lunch and snacks through out the day instead of waiting until I get home and then binge until the time I go to bed. Those little changes alone are making the difference. It is going to be a slow weight loss, but I have lost the weight very fast before and gained every pound back and then some. So just making lifestyle changes and just taking care of me for a change.\nLast edited by jenfett; 06-04-2011 at 11:22 AM.\nGlad you were able to maintain through a rough weekend. I hope you get your new siggy tomorrow.\nYay I was able to set up my signature today!! Little things make me happy.\nDown 7 lbs since last Saturday! I know some of that is water so I was happy that I made it to my weekly goal!\nHad a great week I stayed on track. I went to the gym everyday and had wonderful workouts! I did not binge at all, I have made it through 12 days without a slip up at all!\nMy daughter and I walked in Relay for Life yesterday afternoon, we couldn't stay the entire day and night because my daughter is only 6 and it was super hot so we were out there for 4 and a 1/2 hours and we clocked in 6 miles which is wonderful and we had a wonderful time. Next year we plan on being there start to finish so we will build up to it over the next year.\nLife is good, I have changed a lot mentally over the past month and it has made a difference. I am so much more happier than I have been in a very long time and when momma is happy, everyone is happy LOL I am half way to my first mini goal and once I get there I will do a week of maintenance. Maybe two weeks. To make sure I can stay at that weight before I take it to another level so I can knock off the next 30 lbs. I am hoping by doing this I won't hit that dreaded wall that I always seem to hit.\nSince I did Relay yesterday (which Saturday is my normal break day) today I am resting, my body aches a bit today so I am going to relax and rest and be ready to hit hard again tomorrow!\nwow.. you have already committed (hardest part for me).\nits just going to get better from here !\n\"Official weigh in week 5\"\nMade it through the week very well, worked out every single day and stayed on plan and didn't have any slip ups in meals. I can tell already that my heart and lungs are getting much stronger because I am able to to go a full 35 minutes on the elliptical now and I know I could go longer but my lunch breaks are only an hour and I have to shower because I do get very sweaty. I am able to work with my heartrate around 146 to 150 for 30 of those minutes so I know I am getting healthier regardless of what the scales say. I have had a pretty crappy day but have been on my feet since 7am taking care of my kids first case and hopefully the last case of lice, I was livid to find out they don't do screenings in school any more because it \"hurts the kids feelings\" when they get sent home with lice, so instead now they let them just run a muck and don't tell anyone or even find out when there is an outbreak. But after spending 5 hours working on her hair (she has very long and thick hair) I then cleaned everything on the top floor of the house and have washed all of the bedding and pretty much all of the clothes again. On top of that I got an abscessed tooth yesterday and have been dealing with that as well. The positive thing is that I stayed very busy today and got loads of exercise cleaning the house. I will finish the laundry and clean the bottom floor tomorrow and I have to wash and vacuum the car to make sure there are no buggies in there. I know that it happens to just about every kid, I just hate it LOL. Anywho that's my weekly update.\nSeriously wanting to give up today, it was a really crappy weekend and I feel like why flippin bother anymore. Just having a blue day I guess and hoping that when I go to the gym at lunch it will snap me out of my funk. Just feeling used anymore so why should I try and make myself better, no one gives a real damn anyways. The answer to that question I know is, that I give a damn and that I am doing this for myself. I am just tired. Tired of trying and doing and doing it all. Maybe instead of the elliptical I need to do boxing workouts LOL. Anywho I had to get that off my chest so I can stop brooding and just move on with the day.\nWell thankfully I pulled myself out of my funk yesterday. I did make it to the gym for a really good workout but it was funny because I got to the gym and quickly realized that I had forgotten my socks and well in the mood that I was already in I for a split second thought about not working out and just going back up to my desk but I was like, no I have to do this, so I did my workout without my socks and was so glad that I did because it just helped me get over myself and the feelings that I was having and to just get myself back on track. This journey is going to be a long slow and painful process but it just has to keep going. I have to completely accept that this is my lot in life and that even though it is not easy I have to do it and get healthy or it is going to be a short and miserable life.\nI seriously don't get it, and think my scales officially hate me. I have worked so hard this week and have been good on my food and I just don't understand why I have not lost anything, not even a pound. I am hoping that it is just because that I have had TOM again this week for the second time this month.\nI have decided that if the scales aren't moving something has to be changing so I took measurements of my whole body, or at least the parts I care about LOL I just wish I had done that when I started this process. So the embarrassing numbers are below and I will measure again next week.\nI have also increased my cardio workout to 40 minutes on the elliptical and I have been able to increase it to 3 miles total while maintaining a heart rate average of 150 for 30 of the 40 minutes. So I know I am getting stronger because I have to work harder to get my heart rate up and keep it up. I am also in the processing finding a new house, I viewed one last night and fell in love with it, but so did lots of other people so I am putting it out in the universe that if this is meant to be then it will happen and be easy. PLease be easy, I am tired of having to struggle through everything LOL.\nMan these numbers don't lie and sure do make me feel like a whale. But you know I honestly don't feel that way most of the time, most of the time I feel like I am smaller than I am, and I am ok until I look at a picture or I look in the mirror. It messes with my head sometimes but I haven't given up yet. If though I go through another week without any loss then I am going to have to change my food again and I don't know how much smaller I can on my food, because I need some food, I can't get by on just veggies lol. Anyways I have a ton to do this weekend with cleaning and packing and looking for houses ( just in case the one from last night falls through). So take care all and thank you for reading.\nLast edited by jenfett; 06-25-2011 at 10:40 AM.\nWell I let what usually happens happen...I let stress get in the way of what I was working towards. Lost all motivation, starting eating like crazy, and I didn't stop me, neither did anyone else. I even stopped coming here, actually I think the 25th of June was the last time I logged in. Its all in my head, I know, I just don't know how to deal with stress or not speaking my mind in any other way than hurting myself. It comes so easy for some, but not me. Whatever it may be, I need to cut the strings and get over it, I need to become a totally different person, I need to become me. I am too busy trying to do and be what everyone else wants me to be that I have never learned who I am and what I want in my life. I don't love myself and never really have. I am told that I am a very negative person, always depressed, and think everything stinks. Partly this is true, and while I don't know 100% of the cause I certain know a few key things that are causing most of my grief, and if I would just learn to open my mouth and say what is on my mind or hurting me or what I disagree with then I think I can start making the changes in my life that will help me get to a different level. I fear though hurting anyone's feeling and most people don't like people to disagree with them so I always walk on eggshells and worry about what people think and I just internalize everything, so on top of my weight I have years and years worth of pent up feelings that don't go anywhere but eat away at me everyday. Sometimes I wish I could just be a *****, that would make it so much easier because I wouldn't care what anyone thought.\nAt any rate I just needed to talk that out and at least not have that floating around my head. I went back to the gym today, didn't want to but I did. I will get back on track. I am a person who needs help that is for darn sure, maybe some day I will figure it all out, hopefully sooner rather than later.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T22:15:32Z", "url": "https://www.3fatchicks.com/forum/mini-goals/234274-mini-goal-30lbs.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "When the labeled data are few, exploiting amount of unlabeled data can be helpful for improve learning performance of classifier. The key issue for active learning to solve is how to select the most \"valuable\" training samples to reduce labeled cost of amount of unlabeled samples. In the paper, we propose an efficient active Bayes classifier by using Affinity Propagation (AP) to select the most valuable samples on the unlabeled data sets. Firstly, the method clusters amount of unlabeled sample data by using AP algorithm. Secondly, through exemplars obtained from the results of cluster and similarity matrix, the method selects the unlabeled samples for experts to label. The method choose two kinds of most valuable instances to label: one is cluster center instance, which also called exemplar instance. Another is the instance which stays in the farthest position to the cluster center in the same cluster, that is, the sample which sets in the nearest position to the cluster boundary. The experiment results on UCI data sets demonstrate that our method is simple and more efficient compared with traditional active learning method.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T07:27:54Z", "url": "https://reference.globalspec.com/ref/2635770/an-efficient-active-bayes-classifier-using-affinity-propagation-on-unlabeled-data", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The ash cloud reminds us of the risks of risk aversion. Shutting down Europe's airspace removed the risk of an ash-caused crash, but it also increased all sorts of other risks: the risk of death to a patient because an urgent medical operation might have to be postponed for lack of supplies, the risk of poverty to a Kenyan farm worker because roses could not be flown to European markets, the risk of a collision between ferries on extra night-time sailings in the English Channel. And so on. Risk decisions cannot be taken in isolation. The precautionary principle makes too little allowance for the risks that are run by avoiding risks - the innovations not made, the existing suffering not alleviated. The ash cloud, by reminding us of the risks of not being able to fly planes, is a timely reminder that the risks of global warming must be weighed against the risks of high energy costs - the risks of poverty (cheap energy creates jobs), of hunger (fertiliser costs depend on energy costs), of rainforest destruction and indoor air pollution (expensive electricity makes firewood seem cheaper), of orangutan extinction in subsidised biofuel palm oil plantations.\nOh, and remember the lessons of public choice theory: if you set up a body called the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, don't be surprised if it over-reacts the first time it gets a chance the demonstrate that it considers itself - as all public bodies always do - underfunded.\n...the excitable idea that one volcanic belch has reminded us how small we are reveals what lies behind the contemporary green outlook: a misanthropic view of mankind as a cocky and destructive species which needs to be firmly put back in its place.

This shows that, for all contemporary commentators' claims that they are only interested in communicating the 'scientific facts' about what will happen if we continue distorting and warping the natural world with CO2, in fact they are instinctively drawn to any natural occurrence that can be held up as evidence of Mother Nature's power over deluded mankind.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T06:47:40Z", "url": "http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/dilute-till-safe/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "What Impact Will a 9% Drop in Profits Have On Your Organization?\nUnless your Supply Management organization takes it to the next level, your company is facing a 9% drop in corporate profits this year due to rising prices and other inflationary pressure according to a recent Hackett Group study. For a typical Global 1000 company with 27.8 billion in revenue, Hackett\u2019s study estimated that commodity and offshore labor inflation will drive a 150 million per year hit to the bottom line. Ouch!\nWhy? While most companies are now able to effectively anticipate commodity price increases, more than 60% of companies surveyed by Hackett in the recent study have not been successful at mitigating these cost increases. The reality is that few executives have experienced significant inflation, which is now at levels not seen in 30 years (when inflation rates hovered around 13% back in 1981).\nAnd while inflation may not yet be at 13%, it is bad. Not only do respondents to the Hackett study expect the rate of inflation for commodities overall to rise by more than 30%, to 6.3% a year, but commodity price volatility has increased nearly 60% since before the recession. Making matters worse, at the same time, due to the talent crunch, the rate for internal labor is expected to more than triple from 0.7% to 2.2% and the rate of inflation for external labor is expected to more than double from 1.2% to 3%.\nThis entry was posted in Analyst, Economics on June 30, 2011 by thedoctor.\nRegular readers of SI will know the importance of good should-cost modeling (which is also great for negotiations) as well as good market intelligence (which has dimensions and is valuable in a down economy) in cost reduction and avoidance. And while both should-cost modelling and market intelligence have a number of critical requirements that must be met for success, they both have one key requirement in common \u2014 good data. But where do you get good data? Certainly not from supplier bids! A new supplier is going to bid what it thinks it can get, not what the actual price is. Market indices from governments and professional associations? Better, but they will typically be at least a month or so behind. Trade associations that track and monitor prices on a daily basis or stock markets that trade the commodity? Great \u2014 but do you have the IT skills to integrate the feeds? And are you going to do it for the dozens of raw materials and commodities you need to build your should cost models?\nTo help their clients understand the data, Mintec provides a data analysis package, called Datagain, which can be used to import, graph, analyze, and compare different line items (such as the petrol price in the UK and the petrol price in Australia, normalized to US dollars). A user can graph any set of series, against any frequency, using any (currency and unit) converions, for any date range she chooses. She can also normalize or index this data using a custom formula, factor in seasonality, and plot trends. She can also break the series down across two or four graphs and/or plot specific subseries, against different projections, to see how the price might trend over time under different assumptions. The normalization / indexing equations can use all of the standard algebraic operators and be defined over any set of variables, including user defined variables, that the user chooses.\nIf the user is not sophisticated at trend analysis, or does not want to do it, Mintec also offers Benchmarking and Market (Intelligence) Report services that do a deep dive into a particular raw material, commodity, or service that discuss recent, current, and projected pricing subject to the state of the market and the dominant factors at play. These, by request, reports complement the monthly market reports and commodity fact sheets that track the major commodities and markets and their relative month-over-month changes for buyers who want to look at the bigger picture. If the user wants to learn more about Datagain, analysis, and should-cost modeling, Mintec also provides on-demand out-of-the-box and customized training sessions as well as quarterly newsletters and occasional articles.\nIt\u2019s a huge amount of data, that comes at a very low price point. Most customers pay less than 100K \u00a3s for access to the data they need, when they need it, updated as often as they like. Moreover, medium-sized business can get basic access (to the datafeeds) and access to the desktop Datagain tool for as little as 10K \u00a3s a year. Large enterprises will probably want the on-line hosted applet version (at the higher price-point) that runs through the browser on a hosted database that is accessible anywhere, anytime, and always up to date. While it is more expensive, it\u2019s still cheap compared to what the organization will be paying for their ERP solution (and much more valuable from a cost avoidance perspective).\nThis entry was posted in Best Practices, Market Intelligence on June 30, 2011 by thedoctor.\nTMS Requires 100 Million, Does ERP Require 1 Billion?\nBen Pivar, Vice President and North American Supply Chain Lead for Capgemini regarding Transportation Management Systems (TMS) Pivar says that the economics of installing a TMS package on a client server, for example, doesn\u2019t really work until you have nearly $100 million in freight spend and that\u2019s why on-demand is so popular in that space.\nSI has to agree. Unless a firm has tens of millions in freight spend, the costs of installation, maintenance, and usage tend to dwarf the benefits of using a TMS system. However, what\u2019s even more important to note is that enterprise ERP (from a top vendor) is, on average, at least five, if not (usually) ten times, more expensive to install, integrate, maintain, and use than TMS. This would seem to indicate that the economics of traditional ERP don\u2019t make sense unless your company has 1 Billion in spend, or at least 1 Billion in revenue. In other words, unless you\u2019re a member of the Fortune 2000 or Global 3000, traditional end-to-end on-premise enterprise ERP is probably not for you. And it would appear that Oracle, one of the largest players, tends to agree. Why do you think it has advertisements stating it has 98% of the Fortune 500? It\u2019s not just because the Fortune X, it\u2019s target market, provide it with its biggest deals. It\u2019s because Oracle also understands that unless a company has reached a critical mass, given the cost of the system, the company won\u2019t get the advertised return (which is a key to keeping the company as a high-paying customer year after year).\nHowever, every organization needs a good transaction store and data repository as analysis is key to supply management success. So what does this mean if you\u2019re not one of the lucky ones? Don\u2019t look at a a tradtional on-premise end-to-end ERP from a big boy. Look at either a newer, smaller, slimmed down offering from a smaller player, possibly based on an open-source solution (like Compiere), a suite from a provider that maintains its own transaction store, or a newer, slimmed down, SaaS offering from a traditional provider that can integrate with some BoB solutions in the cloud and offer an effective hybrid solution. Just don\u2019t go for the billion-dollar solution, because your organization likely won\u2019t get a return from the millions it will cost.\nThis entry was posted in Inventory, Logistics, Technology on June 29, 2011 by thedoctor.\nCheck out the live debate in two hours (@ 2pm EDT) between Paul Martyn, VP of Supply Strategy at BravoSolution, and Howard Coleman, principal of MCA Associates, to find out.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized on June 29, 2011 by thedoctor.\nAs per yesterday\u2019s post, it\u2019s been less than five months since we last checked in with Trade Extensions, who had traded up to a Fact Sheet User Interface and added a slew of new features, including improved RFI support, multi-dimensional rankings in e-Negotiation, Google Earth integration, new incumbent rules, and an OLAP foundation to reporting, including the implementation of a new n-way comparison report. Since then, Trade Extensions has been on a tear to add new functionality as fast as it can to make the platform not only one of the most powerful expressive bidding optimization platforms on the planet, but also one of the easiest to use \u2014 listening to its users (which include the Fortune 1000) and adding features and functions that make an average buyer\u2019s life easier, taking usability to a whole new level yet again. And while earth-shattering technology improvements are cool, it is usability that is the ultimate key to to adoption, use, and, ultimately, cost avoidance and reduction in your sourcing organization.\nNot only are there new rules that allow partial awards to be fixed based upon existing scenarios, but the number of constraint categories has doubled. While there were only general and incumbent constraints in the past, there are now an entire category of scenario reference rules and post processing rules. With respect to scenario reference rules, not only can allocations be kept, but bids can be favoured or penalized as well. The post-processing rules are also quite useful. Allocations can automatically be rounded and allocations that don\u2019t meet a minimum number of units can be removed (or re-assigned to the supplier who meets a minimum allocation with the lowest total cost).\nThe buyer now has fine-grained control over what the supplier sees, and can even mix feedback types. For example, if the buyer only wants the top three suppliers to know they are top three, but suppliers four to six to know their exact rank, they can specify that specific rank starts at bidder four, and the top bidders default to \u201ctop 3\u201d. In addition, if the supplier does not meet a minimum bid increment, which can be defined in a number of ways (including, minimum dollar or % decrease over last bid), the supplier gets a nice red error that the bid is not acceptable AND a message indicating the minimum increment required. Finally, and this is really cool, the user can define custom color-coded bid feedback fields based on dynamic formulas that now only let the user know where they rank, but how competitive their bid is (against the current bids from the competition) in English using a buyer defined scale such as \u201cCompetitive\u201d, \u201cSlightly Competitive\u201d, \u201cNot Competitive\u201d, and \u201cNot Acceptable\u201d.\nPlus, the buyer can now chat with users online in an integrated IM client, and immediately see who is online when they log in as it is a widget on their project management dashboard.\nThe \u201cdashboards\u201d for RFX and auction phases have also improved. The summary, bidder summary, and lot summary are now completely customizeable by the user, support custom fields, and user-defined colour codings in the rankings. In addition, there is integrated show/hide, drill-down functionality, and customizeable pop-up (bid, trend, and bidder activity) charts where a user can select one, some, or all of the rows in each report.\nAll and all, it\u2019s a lot of new functionality in a short time frame that makes the tool extremely useable by an average buyer.\nThis entry was posted in Decision Optimization, Spend Analysis, Technology on June 29, 2011 by thedoctor.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T04:54:21Z", "url": "http://sourcinginnovation.com/wordpress/2011/06/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Do you want to know how to start a PT business? If so then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a few things you need to take into consideration. Obviously the first step you will need to move forward is gaining your certificate 3 and 4 in personal training, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what happens both before and after you finish your certification that is most important.\nMost RTOs simply don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t teach you how to set up a personal training business. They teach you about movement, nutrition, muscle groups and how to train clients, but business systems, marketing, sales and even people skills is seriously lacking in their training of PTs entering into the business world.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not too dissimilar to a conveyor belt, churning out personal trainers with no real knowledge on how they are going to succeed once they are out in the market place.\nIn actual fact, if you are looking at how to set up a pt business for success, the planning stages should actually start well before you have finished your qualifications. At least a month out you want to be prepared and ready to hit the ground running so when you do finish, you are ready to go.\nSome of the things you need to look at before even finishing your qualifications should be setting up things such as your business name and company registration, your business logo and what type of training model you are planning to implement into your business.\nOnce you have these things set up, you can then move onto the next stage which would be to set up your online presence. Even if you plan on working out of a gym to start with, you should always be looking at branding yourself and your business, rather than relying on a gym. If you want to know how to set up a PT studio once you leave a gym, the best advice would be to build your brand first so you have an asset you can rebrand into a PT studio.\nOne of the biggest mistakes a PT can make when learning how to set up a PT business is not branding themselves and their business from day 1. So setting up your social media sites such as a Facebook page, an Instagram account, Youtube channel and website are all essential in branding yourself online and giving people a chance to find and follow you.\nThe next thing you will need to consider is how to set up PT business systems. The vast majority of PTs when they start training clients, start out by using and tracking their clients with software such as an excel spreadsheet and Google calendars.\nIn regards to invoicing and accounting, this is usually done through Microsoft Word. This is an extremely messy and unprofessional way to approach your business and one that will waste you a lot of time as you continue your business.\nMy advice would be to look into a client management software from the beginning. There are many out in the market place such as Client Connect and PT Minder to name just a few. This helps you track all of your clients in the one place, do all your invoicing and tax, scheduling your classes, track the progress of your clients such as their measurements and results etc. which can all be graphed and shared with your clients so they can see the results and improvements they are making.\nThis also adds a higher level of professionalism to you as a personal trainer as you will be able to offer a better service.\nFinally, the real thing you will need to learn if you want to set up a personal training business for success is to get business education. This means mentoring from someone who has been there and knows how to set up pt business systems. This includes crucial things such as marketing, sales, retention and referrals.\nWithout the knowledge of how to get people through the door, then how to hold onto them and increase the value per client, your business is going to struggle and will ultimately fail. When PTs enter the market place, most of the time they are unaware how competitive the industry is.\nGet your business systems in order before day 1 and start understanding how to generate leads. If you need assistance on gaining this education, then there is no better starting place than PT Business Coaches. The Inner Circle Membership offered by PT business coaches is a 12 month program which teaches you everything you need to know about how to set up a personal training business, how to set up PT business systems as well as the key skills of marketing, sales, social media and business growth.\nTo get access to the PT business coaches program for only $7 please CLICK HERE to find out more.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T16:29:09Z", "url": "http://ptbusinesscoaches.com/how-to-start-a-pt-business/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "I once had a dog named Bear. He was a bit of a goofball. As with many dogs, he would eat almost anything. However, he developed a particular liking for the flavor of whipped cream. We bought the kind that was pressurized and thus made a particular sound when squirted from the can -- compressed air volumizing the whipped cream, making it fluffy.\nOne time a few months after Bear discovered his love of whipped cream, my mom left the door open when shaving her legs. Bear was in a room nearby, and when my mom started squirting shaving cream from the can, which produced that familiar sound, he came running in and started licking the shaving cream right off her legs.\nHabit learning can be summarized as the \u201cacquisition of associations between stimuli and responses;\u201d that is, our brains learning to associate causes and effects, enhancing certain neural pathways. To simplify things, let\u2019s just say the brain builds \u201croads\u201d between various memories, and the more these roads are travelled the easier they become to travel. The more you think something, the easier it is to think it again.6 This happens regardless of why you thought something or if it is correct or incorrect. For instance, being in a bad mood can cause us to have different morals than we\u2019d have when in a good mood.7 From the \u201cbad mood\u201d nodes of our brain, the easiest roads to travel are often those with \u201cbad\u201d morals.\nFurthermore, once these paths are created, our subconscious travels them whether we like it or not. They may even form new paths without us knowing -- shortcuts to feelings whose origins are then forgotten, the result of countless choices that we made sometime in the past.8 (I once had a friend who trimmed her nails to calm herself down. She picked up the habit by being calm, then trimming her nails). Even our emotions can manifest as these \u201cunconscious habits.\u201d 9 Let me say that again: our emotions can be habits whose origins we\u2019ve forgotten.\nNegative habits can compound themselves by leading to other negative habits, and pretty soon, you\u2019re on a downward spiral with no roads out (literally -- as long as \u201croad\u201d is synonymous with \u201cneural pathway,\u201d of course). When most of your thoughts are negative, you might exhibit symptoms of depression. When most of your thoughts are fearful, you might exhibit symptoms of anxiety.\nReplacing the destination of a well-traveled road can be effective as well (we might call this the \u201cbait and switch\u201d).14 For instance, one of the reasons video games are so appealing is because they provide social interaction combined with a challenge. These are both legitimate psychological needs, but it might be that video games aren\u2019t satisfying anymore. We can\u2019t simply replace them with reading a book -- reading isn\u2019t typically either social or challenging -- but we might replace it with a sport. When your brain feels the need for a challenging social activity, it will think video games. But before long, you can have it thinking soccer, and all the associated thoughts along with your new favorite sport.\nHabits are both physical as well as mental. Our brain learns from what we think -- consciously or subconsciously -- but we can build new roads for it to travel. Roads that lead to positive thought.\nJust don\u2019t get confused between the whipped cream and the shaving cream.\n1A. Earling, The Tetris Effect: Do computer games fry your brain?

{"text": "The words alcohol and America don\u2019t sit comfortably together in my mind. Understandably, since my father fell hard to alcoholism while living his last years in a kooky town on the Californian coast, which had only one way in, and one way out\u2026 He was also addicted to prescription drugs, which he bought by the ton-load over the Internet.\nBut there is another connection between the US and alcohol in my psyche: an American gave me my first alcoholic drink. I was four years old. She was a neighbour, and had a birthday party for her daughter; having recently moved from the States, she got her Apple Juice and Apple Cider mixed up. When my mum came to pick me up some hours later, I was lying beneath the living room table: I staggered home along the pavement, my fairy wings bent.\nThese are two defining moments: I won\u2019t go back to California after the hellish week my brother and I spent trying to get my father into a rehabilitation centre, after the nightmare of negotiating his medical bills after the fourth or fifth overdose; and one could argue that the said American introducing me to alcohol gave me a taste, which I abused somewhat through my adolescence and 20s\u2026 But these are both other stories. Though the two events popped up in my mind last night after a conversation I had at a dinner party at the weekend. It was about the Little Angel Marionette Theatre\u2019s production of the \u2018Very Old Man with Enormous Wings\u2019. The comment was made by an American mother at my daughter\u2019s school who had taken her son to the performance, but had been shocked at what she saw were \u2018inappropriate\u2019 scenes that involved copious drinking. I should add here that the Little Angel Marionette Theatre is a puppet theatre, and is primarily a family venue, though some performances are more grown-up than others. This one welcomed a minimum age of six.\nThe moral is that the village turns into a money-making tourist trap and everyone becomes corrupted, even the priest who turns to cocktails and ends up getting jiggy with the village woman (please keep in mind that they are puppets, so you wouldn\u2019t call this explicit). I was a bit sleepy at this point and lulled by the dark auditorium, put my head back and had a little snooze. So when American mother questioned me about the scene my response was to dismiss it: \u2018Oh, it would have gone straight over my daughter\u2019s head.\u2019 But it did get me thinking, particularly as I have witnessed the destruction of alcohol first hand. On going home I read Marquez\u2019s story and saw that the production company had changed the setting from Marquez\u2019s Spain to a British seaside town, and that the boozy bit was also an addition. Who, after all, would hang out in a British seaside town without a bit of booze and brawl?\nI walked away from the dinner party thinking it was important that I acknowledge the possible insidious affects of this kind of performance on the tender mind of my young daughter, but I was also sorry that it took away from the overall magic of the story. The puppets were sublime, particularly that of the old man. What a beautiful ending when he finally stretches his wings and reaches out to the sky, and escapes the community who had judged him, used him, and kept him caged.\nThis entry was posted in Theatre and tagged advertising, alcohol, American culture, British culture, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, literature, Little Angel Marionette Theatre, Old Man with Enormous Wings, theatre, writing. Bookmark the permalink.\nI was shocked when I went to university at the blatant advertising of drink, and getting drunk, from freshers\u2019 week to discounted nights in the Union. It\u2019s like, university prepares you for life, work, fending for yourself, supposedly, but does it also prepare you for going out every night with your mates and drinking tons of beers and being the last man standing? I didn\u2019t even question it till my dad fell ill, then I had a totally different perspective on what I had spent the past 15 odd years of my life doing \u2013 basically getting drunk.\nReblogged this on Mothermind: Motherhood + Beyond.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T18:24:44Z", "url": "https://lilydunn.co.uk/2013/03/04/61/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "[AUTO](RC):[Counter Blast (1) & Put this unit into your soul] During your opponent's end phase, when an opponent's locked card is unlocked, if you have a \u00abLink Joker\u00bb vanguard, you may pay the cost. If you do, lock that unit.\n...personally, this card is just annoying to go against regardless of whom the Link Joker's final ace is. The fact that Palladium here is made to keep that disruption factor that the Lock effect really has on the opponent by keeping it locked and either severely weakening attacks or even preventing them from ever happening to begin with at the cost of himself. Now, it would be bad if it was just retired and you'd never see it again, but I personally see this as beneficiary as possible by it going into the Soul as Chaos Breaker Dragon will have more Soul food to eat when you want to start killing things and begin drawing more cards and just plus sing in general.\nThere are two major drawbacks to Palladium however. One is that you have to be able to actually Lock something to begin with, and if you are unsuccessful at Break Riding with Infinite-Zero Dragon, then it'll cost you even more Counterblast to even get the Lock to begin with let alone retaining it. The other drawback is that you end up losing Palladium by it going into the Soul and losing a 7,000 power supporter, but seeing how he's able to potentially stop a single attack from even happening singlehandedly is just phenomenal and worth the loss especially if you can reinforce it when the spot is open anyway.\nPalladium is made to be more of a defensive card with offensive stats, so while others sleep on this card *looks down*, I personally am keeping an eye out against this card.\nNext Time: While it's not from Set 13, it's still a Grade 1/7,000 Power that I believe that this card deserves a lot of acknowledgement!\n4th card of the week is Link Joker's newest troll card, Palladium. When a unit unlocks during the End Phase, you Counterblast 1 and move him from RG to the soul to lock it again.\nHooray, finally I can talk about this card in more detail than the others. Firstly, this card is pretty neat in Chaos Breaker Dragon decks. His uses are fairly extensive, with the most obvious being he fuels the soul for Chaos Breaker's Limit Break. He can also shut down a front row and thus a whole column for another turn without Chaos needing to commit anything else from the hand. Especially if you have a better booster and need to sack it away nice and neatly.\nHe's also good for when you are stuck riding Chaos on turn 3 and you're reduced to playing the stall game until you can Chaos Retire away their units. However, if your actual gambit of Chaos Breaker over Infinite Zero works, Palladium's pretty redundant, unless you absolutely need one of their columns re-locked for any reason, since locking generally isn't as good as retiring in terms of long-term benefits.\nThe fact he now has Colony Maker to search him helps too. I'd run him, if only because to give Chaos more shots at retiring and also because Link Joker has plenty of 7k boosters to play with.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T23:08:11Z", "url": "https://www.pojo.com/cardfightvanguard/cotd/2014/May/29.shtml", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

You're defining the ABI for your specific OpenCL implementation, but Clang might reasonably support other implementations with their own ABIs.  So this name is inappropriate.\n> > > Now, if I understand how SPIR works, SPIR does require some sort of stable lowering of these atomic operations in order to ensure that the resulting LLVM IR can be ingested into an arbitrary implementation.  (Ot at least that was true prior to SPIR V?)  Therefore, SPIR needs to specify a lowering for these atomic operations, and that probably includes ABI values for specific sync-scopes.  But the appropriate name for that would be the \"SPIR ABI\", not the \"OpenCL ABI\".  And, of course, you would need to be sure that you're implementing the lowering that SPIR actually wants.\n> > The ABI is not intended for a specific OpenCL implementation, but for extending to other languages. For example, we have a downstream C++ based language called HCC, which may support atomic scope with an ABI different than OpenCL atomic scope ABI.\n> By \"ABI\" you mean that it might present a different model of synchronization scopes to the source language?  Okay, that's great, and it explains a lot of things that were very murky about some of our previous conversations.\n>   - They don't need to be in the __builtin_opencl namespace.\n>   - They *do* need to be enabled only in language modes with well-defined sync-scope models, which for now just means OpenCL.\n>   - The language mode's sync-scope model should determine everything about the scope argument, including its type.  Sema-level validation requires first determining the language's sync-scope model.\n>   - There is no meaningful way to \"default\" the scope argument on the non-scoped builtins the way that we are now.  Instead, the scope argument should only exist for the scoped builtins.\n> Alternatively, if you potentially want the opencl-model builtins to be usable from non-opencl languages, the right design is for HCC to use its own set of builtins with their own type-checking rules.\n> In either case, I don't think it's a good idea to call this \"ABI\", which is associated too strongly with target-lowering concepts.  You're really talking about a source-language concept.\nWe could introduce __builtin_hcc_atomic_* in downstream HCC.\nWe need a generic approach to represent atomic scope values for different languages and associated semantic/codegen needs, and AtomicScopeABI seems generic enough to serve the purpose. It has interface for semantic checking (isValid), and the interface to map to LLVM sync scope for both constant and variable arguments. If the name is not proper, we could rename it to just `AtomicScope`.\nI can remove the default atomic scope for atomic expressions without scope originally.

{"text": "For most of 2018 the Children at Play Network has been working with staff from New Directions Housing Corporation and ChooseWell Communities. The goal remains simple \u2013 provide all children with amazing opportunities to engage in free play in the outdoors. That is more complex than first meets the eye. The following is a reflection from two people engaged in our first Seeds for Urban Play project.\nLast winter we embarked on an incredible new adventure with the Children at Play Network, Bernheim Forest, and Choosewell Communities to bring free play to our residents. New Directions Housing Corporation provides affordable housing to over 1,000 families in the Louisville metro area, and not only houses many kids but also provides an afterschool and summer camp at many of our properties. This partnership was a perfect opportunity for us to train our staff and start implementing enriching programming through free play at our apartment communities.\nThe overall process of first learning what free play was, what it takes to have one, how to participate, and what is required was amazing. After our training, we couldn\u2019t wait to get started and share these experiences with our resident families. On September 22, we were able to see first hand what free play looks like up close. Participating in free play as a facilitator, gave us the opportunity to observe, let the children run wild with their imagination and be creative, guide and let them lead. Overall it had a positive outcome on our children and youth; it gave them the opportunity to have control of something and not feeling like it has to be corrected; but the feeling that they are in lead.\nThe dynamics of what free play consists of, how it happens, and the outcome and the participation of the community and children was an eye opener. The children jumped right in and immediately engaged with the loose parts and each other. In the role of facilitator, we extricated ourselves so that the children had ownership over the process and their own play, which was difficult to do at times. It\u2019s not a form of play that most of us are used to facilitating. However, once we were able to release our own management of the play, we were able to see the depth of each child\u2019s engagement. For instance, they didn\u2019t run from one activity to the next, they stayed with what they were working on until they decided it was complete.\nAs adults and parents, it can be difficult to remove yourself from directing the play. But we are confident that with a little practice, it will come more naturally. This experience was truly rewarding and we are looking forward to our next free play day to further expand upon our training.\nIf you would like to learn more\u2026click HERE for a short video of the project.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T20:39:46Z", "url": "https://childrenatplaynetwork.com/reflections-on-free-play-seeds-for-urban-play/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "You should not receive this vaccine if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any vaccine containing Japanese encephalitis virus.\nWhat is Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine (SA14-14-2)?\nJapanese encephalitis is a serious disease caused by a virus. It is the leading cause of viral encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) in Asia. Encephalitis is an infection of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord. This infection often causes only mild symptoms, but prolonged swelling of the brain can cause permanent brain damage or death.\nJapanese encephalitis virus is carried and spread by mosquitoes.\nThe Japanese encephalitis SA14-14-2 vaccine is used to help prevent this disease in adults and adolescents who are at least 17 years old.\nThis vaccine is recommended for people who live in or travel to areas where Japanese encephalitis is known to exist, or where an epidemic has recently occurred.\nYou should receive the vaccine and booster dose at least 1 week prior to your arrival in an area where you may be exposed to the virus.\nNot everyone who travels to Asia needs to receive a Japanese encephalitis vaccine. Follow your doctor instructions or the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThis vaccine is also recommended for people who work in a research laboratory and may be exposed to Japanese encephalitis virus through needle-stick accidents or inhalation of viral droplets in the air.\nLike any vaccine, the Japanese encephalitis SA14-14-2 vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.\na weak immune system caused by disease or by taking certain medicines or receiving cancer treatments.\nVaccines may be harmful to an unborn baby and generally should not be given to a pregnant woman. However, not vaccinating the mother could be more harmful to the baby if the mother becomes infected with a disease that this vaccine could prevent. Your doctor will decide whether you should receive this vaccine, especially if you have a high risk of infection with Japanese encephalitis virus.\nDo not receive this vaccine without telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.\nThe Japanese encephalitis SA14-14-2 vaccine is given in a series of 2 shots. The shots are usually 28 days apart. Your individual booster schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by the health department of the state you live in.\nIn addition to receiving the Japanese encephalitis vaccine, use protective clothing, insect repellents, and mosquito netting around your bed to further prevent mosquito bites that could infect you with the Japanese encephalitis virus.\nBecoming infected with Japanese encephalitis is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine. However, like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.\nGet emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; dizziness, weakness, fast heart rate; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.\npain, redness, tenderness, or a hard lump where the shot was given.\nWhat other drugs will affect Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine?\nThis list is not complete. Other drugs may interact with Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.

{"text": "\u2190 How do you get into that popular course?\nMegan Duffy had a thoughtful post on not inducing anxiety in others. She mentioned the specific case of reducing anxiety in others by being really clear. Instead of saying something like meet me Thursday, say why. I agree that getting asked to meet a professor or a boss is a scary thing, so the detail she suggested is great.\nFor the moment, not anxious?\nBut today I\u2019m thinking more about my own anxiety, and yours. Anxiety is so often a problem, we may lose sight of its positive side. So I think we should embrace our anxiety, for it is a big part of what makes us empathetic humans. I think anxiety is fundamentally a social feeling. We feel anxious if we think we will let someone else down. We could also feel anxious anticipating the reactions of unreasonable people. Miscommunication is also a rich field for anxiety.\nWhat exactly is anxiety? What comes up on Google for anxiety is \u201ca feeling of nervousness or unease\u2026typically about an uncertain event or outcome.\u201d Obviously life throws all kinds of events and circumstances at us about which we are uncertain and worry. I guess worry has to be the first cousin of anxiety. Together and in a helpful way, they can help us do what we should do, pay forward the debt to our future self, so she is as happy and fulfilled as she can be.\nSo the best thing to reduce anxiety is simply to do what needs to be done, so you won\u2019t have anything to be anxious about. If you are worried about being late, be on time. If you are anxious about a test, study more. Oh, if only it were so simple. Sometimes you cannot do what you must do. Conflicting demands on your time can make you anxious. If I let anxiety run my life entirely, I would never do anything new or creative, just follow the demands others put on my time.\nSometimes anxiety gets higher and higher because not doing something makes you anxious, yet you somehow keep failing to do it. In this case, listen to your anxiety. What is it trying to tell you? Do you actually not want to do the thing you think you want to do? Or is it something else? Try to figure it out. A healthy level of anxiety we all need. Sometimes it will build up to nearly unbearable levels, simply to tell you you don\u2019t really want that career, that project, that relationship.\nIn some ways, this is a very simplistic post because it is not addressing how crippling anxiety can become. But the basic message is not simple. It is that anxiety is a part of being human, so fundamental that no anxiety would be as troubling as too much anxiety. And our anxiety is telling us something. Listen and try to figure out what it is.\nThis entry was posted in Managing an academic career, Mentoring, Social interactions, Undergraduates and tagged anxiety, career choices, clarity, kindness, self honesty.

{"text": "That transformation was behind the recent decision by the prestigious 60-year-old Shakespeare Quarterly to embark on an uncharacteristic experiment in the forthcoming fall issue \u2014 one that will make it, Ms. Rowe says, the first traditional humanities journal to open its reviewing to the World Wide Web.\nMixing traditional and new methods, the journal posted online four essays not yet accepted for publication, and a core group of experts \u2014 what Ms. Rowe called \u201cour crowd sourcing\u201d \u2014 were invited to post their signed comments on the Web site MediaCommons, a scholarly digital network. Others could add their thoughts as well, after registering with their own names. In the end 41 people made more than 350 comments, many of which elicited responses from the authors. The revised essays were then reviewed by the quarterly\u2019s editors, who made the final decision to include them in the printed journal, due out Sept. 17.\nThe Shakespeare Quarterly trial, along with a handful of other trailblazing digital experiments, goes to the very nature of the scholarly enterprise. Traditional peer review has shaped the way new research has been screened for quality and then how it is communicated; it has defined the border between the public and an exclusive group of specialized experts.\nToday a small vanguard of digitally adept scholars is rethinking how knowledge is understood and judged by inviting online readers to comment on books in progress, compiling journals from blog posts and sometimes successfully petitioning their universities to grant promotions and tenure on the basis of non-peer-reviewed projects.\nThe quarterly\u2019s experiment has so far inspired at least one other journal \u2014 Postmedieval \u2014 to plan a similar trial for next year.\nJust a few years ago these sorts of developments would have been unthinkable, said Dan Cohen, director of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. \u201cSerious scholars are asking whether the institutions of the academy \u2014 as they have existed for decades, even centuries \u2014 aren\u2019t becoming obsolete,\u201d he said.\nEach type of review has benefits and drawbacks.\nThe traditional method, in which independent experts evaluate a submission, often under a veil of anonymity, can take months, even years.\nClubby exclusiveness, sloppy editing and fraud have all marred peer review on occasion. Anonymity can help prevent personal bias, but it can also make reviewers less accountable; exclusiveness can help ensure quality control but can also narrow the range of feedback and participants. Open review more closely resembles Wikipedia behind the scenes, where anyone with an interest can post a comment. This open-door policy has made Wikipedia, on balance, a crucial reference resource.\nMs. Rowe said the goal is not necessarily to replace peer review but to use other, more open methods as well.\nIn some respects scientists and economists who have created online repositories for unpublished working papers, like repec.org, have more quickly adapted to digital life. Just this month, mathematicians used blogs and wikis to evaluate a supposed mathematical proof in the space of a week \u2014 the scholarly equivalent of warp speed.\nIn the humanities, in which the monograph has been king, there is more inertia. \u201cWe have never done it that way before,\u201d should be academia\u2019s motto, said Kathleen Fitzpatrick, a professor of media studies at Pomona College.\nMs. Fitzpatrick was a founder of the MediaCommons network in 2007. She posted chapters of her own book \u201cPlanned Obsolescence\u201d on the site, and she used the comments readers provided to revise the manuscript for NYU Press. She also included the project in the package she presented to the committee that promoted her to full professor this year.\nMany professors, of course, are wary of turning peer review into an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d-like competition. They question whether people would be as frank in public, and they worry that comments would be short and episodic, rather than comprehensive and conceptual, and that know-nothings would predominate.\nAfter all, the development of peer review was an outgrowth of the professionalization of disciplines from mathematics to history \u2014 a way of keeping eager but uninformed amateurs out.\n\u201cKnowledge is not democratic,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Lamont, a Harvard sociologist who analyzes peer review in her 2009 book, \u201cHow Professors Think: Inside the Curious World of Academic Judgment.\u201d Evaluating originality and intellectual significance, she said, can be done only by those who are expert in a field.\nThe most daunting obstacle to opening up the process is that peer-review publishing is the path to a job and tenure, and no would-be professor wants to be the academic canary in the coal mine.\nAlthough initially cautious, Mr. Galey said he is now \u201centirely won over by the open peer review model.\u201d The comments were more extensive and more insightful, he said, than he otherwise would have received on his essay, which discusses Shakespeare in the context of information theory.\nAdvocates of more open reviewing, like Mr. Cohen at George Mason argue that other important scholarly values besides quality control \u2014 for example, generating discussion, improving works in progress and sharing information rapidly \u2014 are given short shrift under the current system.\n\u201cThere is an ethical imperative to share information,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, who regularly posts his work online, where he said thousands read it. Engaging people in different disciplines and from outside academia has made his scholarship better, he said.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T01:22:26Z", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/arts/24peer.html?_r=1&ref=general&src=me&pagewanted=all", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

If you have the money saved already, this article is not for you.\nYou try to save the amount or borrow it from someone else or borrow it from your own retirement fund.\nThe first step is to absolutely work the numbers and figure out your budget. While this is not an actual savings tactic, it\u2019s a crucial step in the process because it gives you a concrete goal to work towards.\nKnowing this number makes it a real goal and clears up the confusion and vagueness of having some idea of some large dollar amount, that\u2019s probably unattainable anyway. Remember, half the battle is gaining mental clarity and setting the goal.\nRemember, half the battle is gaining mental clarity and setting the goal.\nStep 2 \u2013 Then use a home-buying calculator to plug in your numbers, and it will give you a better sense of how big of a home you can afford.\nZillow\u2019s mortgage calculator is pretty helpful in helping you find this number.\nStep 3 \u2013 To know how your potential creditors think you\u2019re capable of handling, get pre-qualified. Do not look for a $500,000 home if you are pre-qualified for only $300,000. This is a reality-check step.\nFor simplicity\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say we did our budgeting and used the calculator to figure out that you can afford and qualified for a $500,000 home, so your down payment savings goal should be $100,000.\nNow consider these tips to save up.\nNow you can start to plan how much money you should really put aside each month.\nYou\u2019ll also get a better idea of how long it will take to reach your goal. If you\u2019re on the five-year plan, that means you\u2019ll need to save an extra $20,000 a year.\nDon\u2019t panic, just break it down further. An extra $20,000 a year is about $1,700 a month, which sounds way less intimidating.\nKeep in mind you\u2019ll still need to continue saving for your emergency fund, IRA, and paying down debt.\nYou\u2019ve heard this from me again and again: get a side gig, make extra money, work overtime, increase your income!\nIt sounds like generic advice but there\u2019s a reason why experts dish out the same advice: it\u2019s because earning extra money is a lot easier than drastically changing your lifestyle to scrimp and save.\nGoing this route is just not realistic or sustainable. Pinching pennies is not going to get you closer to the $1,700 each month, but increasing your income will.\nThis is going to take research on your part, but it\u2019ll be worth it \u2014 just imagine how you will enjoy your dream house, and what the extra income will afford you.\nThe best way to start is to make a list of what you\u2019re good at, and if you can leverage and outsource those skills during your free time to make that $1,700.\nOne of the items that your mortgage lender will look at is your overall DTI (debt-to-income) ratio.\nIf you\u2019re carrying a lot of credit card debt, you might want to look into a personal loan to consolidate and lower your payment. Debt consolidation loans can help you have a single monthly payment at a fixed rate.\nNot only does this help you eliminate debt faster, but it can help increase your credit score by up to 40 points according to Payoff.\nIf you\u2019re able to reduce your monthly payment and increase your score, you\u2019ll be in great shape to qualify for a mortgage.\nAfter you establish that, any kind of extra money that comes in during the year goes straight into that fund.\nThis includes any bonus from your employer, tax refunds, Christmas bonuses, gifts, inheritances, lottery, gambling win, etc.\nA 20 percent savings goal may be discouraging, especially if you have zero saved, but it can be done \u2014 all you need is a concrete plan and a savings mentality.\nThese methods are tried by people I know.\nTry to find alternative areas where housing is cheaper and your present savings allow for you to buy a home there, instead of the dream location you previously thought about.\nIf you have valuable property elsewhere then sell it to arrange for mortgage down payment. This includes inherited valuables, foreign real estate, etc.\nPutoff savings in your retirement fund for a couple of years. Redirect this fund to your home buying fund.\nIf all else fails, then go for mortgage insurance by paying only a small % of the loan, typically 5% only. But, be prepared to spend extra $100-$300 per month on mortgage insurance. You can start repaying the loan faster and as soon as cross the 20% ownership criteria, opt out of that insurance.\nStart with determining how much down payment is required for your need, your credit and home location. Then divide the number by the months you\u2019re willing to wait. Once you have the monthly savings goal, start by aggressively saving that amount from your monthly budget or increase side income.\nYou can also bring in additional money from selling some of your valuable stuff to reach your goal early.

{"text": "Adweek: So what\u2019s a digital-media tyro like you doing at a fusty old-media company like CBS?\nJim Lanzone: I don\u2019t really think of it that way at all. People think the Internet will supercede TV, but it\u2019s really been more additive than anything else, largely because it\u2019s so portable. It\u2019s not taking anything away from linear television; if anything, it\u2019s encouraged people to spend even more time watching video.\nAW: The fact that we can watch TV on a telephone: is this doing something insidious to the parts of our brain that process narrative?\nJL: Think about the very early days of TV\u2014the first shows were structured just like radio broadcasts or Broadway shows. You start with the familiar and you expand from there. Creative people haven\u2019t taken advantage of the new media platforms; we\u2019re still in this brackish time between two eras.\nAW: You still watch TV?\nJL: I\u2019m a binge watcher. I have DirecTV, so I have a ton of shows on the DVR: The Daily Show, [Real Time With] Bill Maher, SNL. I\u2019ve been watching How I Met Your Mother for six years. There are definitely more shows out there that I want to watch that I don\u2019t have time to watch, which I suppose is a great sign of where programming is headed.\nAW: Why did CBS issue a fatwa against Hulu?\nAW: Can you write code?\nJL: I never got into programming when I was a kid. I was too busy playing Pitfall and Kaboom! on Atari to write code. But then again, I don\u2019t think Les Moonves knows how to make a television set either.\nAW: So there\u2019s no disconnect between the old media centers\u2014New York, L.A.\u2014and Silicon Valley?\nJL: Well, you\u2019re looking at it from a geographic standpoint and that really isn\u2019t relevant any longer. I think Silicon Valley is the third leg of the media stool; I mean, there\u2019s a reason why all the animated features are made in Silicon Valley now. Engineers are the new artists of this generation of media.\nAW: Are you from Silicon Valley?\nJL: I grew up in San Carlos, where Oracle now stands. In fact, they built Oracle on the old Marine World site. George Lucas used some of the elephants from Marine World in Star Wars, and after it came out\u2014I must have seen it 25 times that summer\u2014they started offering Bantha rides at Marine World.\nAW: Speaking of which, what the hell happened to George Lucas? Those three Star Wars prequels were just god-awful.\nJL: I know what happened to George Lucas: the \u201880s. If movies peaked in the \u201870s, then it\u2019s fair to say that the 2000s is the Renaissance period for TV. The new Battlestar [Galactica] was at least a thousand times better than the old one. And I almost didn\u2019t watch it at first because I was afraid it was going to ruin my childhood memories of the original.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T09:14:15Z", "url": "https://www.adweek.com/digital/first-mover-interview-jim-lanzone-131128/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Architect Elisabetta Rizzato was born and raised just outside of Venice, Italy. After 31 years, it might seem safe to assume she\u2019d bore of the sights, spots and surroudings of this great, tourist-rich locale, but rather, the opposite is true. Elisabetta continually discovers amazing new places and hidden gems which she shares on her blog ITALIANBARK, along with plenty of posts on interior design, and her work as an architect.\nStart your day with the best coffee in Venice. Located close to the railway station, Torrefazione Cannaregio is a must.\nOpened in 1930, this is the oldest coffee shop in town and offers many different kinds of coffees, toasted in-house with a big, old coffee machine. I recommend the Remer blend, a coffee you can only drink here as it\u2019s a secret recipe!\nTake a morning walk in Sestiere Cannaregio and visit the workshop of a marionette maker called L\u2019isola di Pinocchio.\nIt may be hidden behind an ordinary door, in an ancient mezzanine, but here you will step into a magical place, surrounded by handmade marionettes by an amazing artisan.\nLibreria Acqua Alta bookshop, in Sestiere Castello, is one of the most original bookshops in the world.\nSelling vintage and new books, this place is literally filled with books everywhere, displayed in boats, gondolas, bathtubs, etc. It\u2019s also located between two of my favorite corners of Venice: one is Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo, situated in front of the stunning Scuola Grande di San Marco (which has since become the city hospital).\nThe other corner is Campo San Lorenzo. In this spot, you will see one of the three bent bell-towers of the city. The one of San Giorgio dei Greci church is almost as crooked as the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa! But, I digress. After grabbing a book, find a bench and enjoy it.\nBefore lunchtime, head to Rialto.\nCross the world-famous bridge and enjoy some fresh fruit and fish in the ancient market of the town, Mercato di Rialto. Despite being a very famous one, it is still a genuine Venetian market where you will find locals buying fresh fish. It has also recently been listed as one of the 10 best markets in the world by The Guardian. If you are wondering where the vegetables and fruit come from, they\u2019re from an island near Venice called \u201cl\u2019orto di Venezia,\u201d Sant\u2019Erasmo, almost entirely covered with fields!\nEnjoy sunshine at Le Zattere after an \u201combra\u201d (glass of wine) and some \u201ccicchetti\u201d (Venetian fingerfood), then head south for a proper lunch to Sestiere Dorsoduro. Here, you will find many bars and small \u201cbacari\u201d (typical Venice \u201costerie\u201d) to enjoy something fast. I recommend a deviation to the Bacareto da Lele, a really small corner with amazing small paninis and good wine! It was my favorite bacaro during my university years and is still very popular in town by locals. Alternatively, enjoy lunch at Fondamenta delle zattere, at the southern edge of the city. Facing Giudecca Channel, it is the best place to enjoy the sun and take a long walk afterwards. Its name comes from the zattere, a la the historic rafts that were docked here to store the city\u2019s timber. It is also the best place to enjoy an ice cream, maybe at Gelateria da Nico , loved by Penny Guggenheim and Angelina Jolie, and famous for its Gianduiotto. It\u2019s also the best starting point for an afternoon stroll among the best shops!\nEven if it\u2019s crowded with tourists, Accademia area in Sestiere Dorsoduro has always been one of my favorites. It is really filled with culture and art and has recently become a real art-walk, thanks to the Venice Museum Mile project. Here, you can choose between contemporary art at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection and Punta della Dogana, historical paintings at Gallerie dell\u2019Accademia, and many other museums and historical palaces\u2026all within a one-mile radius! Don\u2019t forget to visit Biennale and its collateral events between May and November!\nHere, we are in the best area for some good shopping in Venice. Near Accademia, you will find some of the most original design shops in town, such as the incredible Fiorella Gallery (if you are lucky enough to find it open, as it doesn\u2019t abide by regular hours). Within a few steps you will also find Venetia Studium, a historical shop selling wonderful fabrics, as well as the amazing \u2014 and often imitated \u2014 Fortuny Lamps. It\u2019s very expensive, I know, but if you are a design-lover you can\u2019t not love them! Next, head to Mercerie area, a trio of streets between Piazza San Marco and Rialto, for the most famous brands. This is the \u201cshopping district\u201d of Venice!\nFor aperitivo (appetizers) and dinner, head far from the tourist traps to Fondamenta della Misericordia, in a northern direction back to Sestiere Cannaregio. Here you will enjoy a gorgeous sunset. It is also one of the city areas where locals can relax, unwind and enjoy dinnertime.\nWalk across the Judish Ghetto \u2014 one of the most fascinating places in Venice \u2014 and enjoy an aperitivo in one of the bars you will find along the Fondamenta, such as Vino Vero, a brand new spot where you can sip your wine outside around a briccole (wooden poles in the water transformed into small tables)!\nIn this area, there are also many good, affordable restaurants there are not too crowded. Here in fondamenta della Misericordia, you will find Paradiso Perduto, a typical Venetian restaurant founded by four students with a very spartan mood and fresh food. Five minutes from here, towards Strada Nuova, Osteria alla Vedova is another good spot. With its lovely, retro interior and its delicious polpettas, you will not be disappointed!\nIf you are still not tired after this day in Venice, you can head to another area of the city where university students hang out (I sure did as a student)! The spot is called Campo Santa Margherita, and it\u2019s crowded with osterie and bars. On your way there, don\u2019t forget to deviate towards another magical corner in Venice, Squero San Trovaso, where you will see the officina, one of the last gondola craftmakers left in town.\nWhile this is just an overview (and maybe this day could last 48 hours, actually!), there\u2019s plenty more great reasons to spend time in Venice\u2026 Just think, we haven\u2019t even gotten to Piazza San Marco!\nwhat a great guide to Venice! Bookmarking for my next visit.\nThanks \u2013 perfect timing! We are landing in Venice this June, after a Seabourn cruise through the Adriatic. Any suggestions for the best area to shop for antiques?\nWonderful suggestions :) I know Venice really well and I love (and know) about half the places you\u2019ve mentioned \u2013 really off the beaten path and some stunning quiet corners \u2013 so now I\u2019ve some new ones to add next time.\nI would love to eat my way around Italy. Saving towards this dream trip!\nThe historic texture of the city is truly fascinating.\nI would like to go with certainty in the summer holiday.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T15:38:14Z", "url": "https://www.designsponge.com/2015/12/24-hours-in-venice-italy.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

She is the owner of Breakthrough Learning Solutions, a company directed at sharing the most cutting-edge information with parents and educators. She is the parent of a child with learning challenges, and has experienced first-hand the need for a positive, strengths-based approach to helping our children reach success!\nA few weeks ago, my husband and I went to see the movie \u201cThe Imitation Game.\u201d It is the story of Alan Turing, a British scientist, cryptanalyst, and computing pioneer, and his development of a system to crack Nazi codes in order to significantly shorten World War II. It was both fascinating and brilliantly acted. Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s Turing breathtakingly transports viewers to another place and time.\nAs we processed through the movie over dinner, my husband (an engineer himself), said ,\u201d He was a pretty quirky guy, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d I shared my hunch that Turing\u2019s portrayal was indicative of someone with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, reviewing the nuances that led me to that conclusion.\nI became intrigued if my intuition was correct. I spent the evening diving into blogs, websites, and eventually Autism activist sites, hoping to find the opinions of others. Although the term Asperger\u2019s was not around during Turing\u2019s life, I found there is great debate in the Autism community about the pros and cons of posthumous diagnostics. Many were passionate about the danger of applying labels to someone who is not alive to interview or participate in the diagnostic process. Others were equally vehement about the societal advantages of adding brilliant, world-altering people into the category of those living successfully with some form of autism. Before I knew it, I\u2019d spent several hours drawn into to the debate and reading link after link, comment after comment.\nI stopped dead in my tracks. DID it really matter if Turing is considered to have been on the autism spectrum? Of course not. A posthumous diagnosis does not change who he was, the impact he had on our every day lives in terms of computer science, or his undeniable shortening of World War II.\nSo why had I spent hours digging, researching, reading? Yes, it was out of curiosity, diligence, and an interest in the opinions of activists within the autism community, but I have to admit, ashamedly, that is was also part of my need to make sense of a highly unusual man. It was my need to put things neatly in a box, tied with a bow. I was disappointed in myself, quite honestly. I try diligently to spend my days helping teachers, parents, children look outside of the box, to celebrate their uniqueness, to be empowered to find their own way, and yet here I was, trying to fit someone nicely and neatly into a corner, giving a label some kind of power.\nShame on me. I should know better. Honestly, we all should.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. Diagnosis don\u2019t matter. Yes, yes, they do help us answer questions, they can certainly help us obtain services, and quite often they can help us guide interventions. But when it comes to understanding, TRULY understanding, a person, his or her traits, his qualities, her heart, a diagnostic label is a grossly insufficient way to tie things up.\nBrilliant, funny, loving, tender, energetic\u2026.these are the words that matter.\nChild. Father. Brother. Sister. Uncle. Son. These are the words that matter.\nIn the midst of our diagnosis-laden, therapy-heavy world, sometimes we need to stop, take a deep breath, and really focus on was DOES matter. It is the true heart and soul of each individual, the rare and unmatched gifts and talents we all bring to the table, that determine who we are in this world.\nWhat a month August has been! I have had the humbling opportunity to quite literally meet with teachers, parents and administrators across the country! From a large district in Cheyenne, Wyoming to a private school is Washington, D.C., teachers and administrators have been busily preparing for a fresh year of learning. From a small adobe school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to a school for unique learners in Tulsa, Oklahoma, bulletin boards are going up, pencils are being sharpened, and fresh books are being placed on desks in anticipation of students. From a district in Lexington, Kentucky, where teachers came during their own summer days to learn about children with learning challenges to a group of motivated and profoundly dedicated home school parents in Atlanta, Georgia, the 2015-2016 school year is underway.\nOUR KIDS ARE IN GOOD HANDS!\nMy work affords me the unique ability to view education in every form in every state. It is a rare and sacred experience for someone like me, who has never dreamed of being anything other than a teacher.\nWhat I know is this: Our kids are in good hands!\nI am blessed to spend my days with teachers: Classroom teachers, home school teachers, public school teachers and private school teachers. Teachers who wake up every morning, pushing through the fatigue and haze of sleepiness to quickly grab materials together to create the lesson that came to them in their sleep. Teachers who have gone out and developed schools to meet the needs of other children who have challenges similar to their child\u2019s. Teachers who have given up their own careers or person goals to stay home and educate their own children, even though it means seldom having a break or a second for themselves.\nTeachers are a forced with which to be reckoned!!!\nAside from a mother\u2019s ferocious love for her children, I know of few other earthly forces as powerful as the Teaching Heart. Thousands upon thousands of men and women face every day, ready to love, nurture and educate our children. Against increasing and ceaseless odds, they demonstrate dedication, energy, creativity, passion, compassion, mastery and curiosity. They spend their own time, their own limited income, and their own emotional resources to keep children engaged, loved and moving forward. They teach our children how to read, how to add, and how to share. They teach that art is essential, music is magical, and who you are on the playground is as important as how you do in the classroom.\nSo let me share the good news: Our kids are in good hands!\nOur diverse, expansive and often tumultuous nation is brimming over with people dedicated to the art of teaching. Nurture your child\u2019s teachers. Be present. Be available. Ask them what they need, and then help out. Encourage and support them. When you see your child\u2019s teacher dragging at the end of a long day, smile and say thank you. Take the time to ask you neighbor why she has chosen to home school her children, and watch as her eyes light up. Almost every teacher will tell you it\u2019s never the children that cause them to leave the profession. It\u2019s never their lack of love or dedication, but rather a sense of unsurmountable expectations that don\u2019t seem to go noticed or appreciated. Show your support and appreciation. Let\u2019s keep the good ones around.\nThere is life-changing power in the Teaching Heart. It is the power to move mountains, the power to love children, the power to change the world. Think about it. Pray about it. Then go nurture it.\nThe 4 of July. Just the thought of this holiday floods my heart and brain with precious childhood memories. I can close my eyes and instantly be transported back in time. I am a little girl in pristine Madeira, Ohio, holding my dad\u2019s hand while we stood on the sidewalk outside the Daisy Chain gift shop and watched the parade go by. I look up at my dad, a veteran of the Korean War, as tears stream down his cheeks and his free hand is either placed over his heart or is saluting other vets marching by. I am equal parts embarrassed and impressed as his voice seems to be the loudest, boldest one singing God Bless America as the high school marching band plays. The parade is followed by a huge 20-family cookout in the cul-de-sac, complete with decorate-your-bike contests, endless hours of Kick the Can, and of course hundreds of sparklers. My memories are of what July 4 should be\u2026.a country-wide birthday party for America.\nToday I still look upon the 4 of July as our nation\u2019s birthday party, but I find myself focusing more on the concept of independence and freedom. I realize now, from the vantage of age ( and I hope wisdom), the sacrifices that went in to our ability to march in parades and watch fireworks. Though my dad never spoke of his war days, I have learned more about what he likely experienced, and the tears have a more powerful message to me. Now I am married to a veteran, and this 4 I have a nephew who is deployed. While I cherish the day to join the country in an American birthday celebration, I also am humbled and overwhelmed with the ability to pull back the curtain and see what cost this freedom and independence has been for so many.\nHow brave those men were 239 years ago, signing a declaration of independence from tyranny and an over-reaching government, not knowing what was ahead, but knowing with faith and conviction they could move forward. This July 4, as we enjoy grilling out and spending time with family and friends, let\u2019s not forget the cost of freedom, and take inspiration from the visionaries that came before us!\nThank you so much to those of you who have contacted me after speaking engagements, conferences, and meetings, asking if there is a way of sharing information and updates in an ongoing manner.\nI have always been a bit intimidated about the whole \u201cblogosphere\u201d thing, but I agree with you\u2026.there are too many cutting edge research articles, books to review, and new products that can help our kids to not get information out on a more regular basis.\nSO\u2026.here it is! I will use this space to interview professionals, review products and books, and to share insights and ideas. My hope is that this will become an interactive forum where we can all share ideas and encouragement, and new ways to reach children who struggle!\nStay tuned, the first \u201creal\u201d blog entry is soon to follow. I look forward to visiting with you soon!\nDepending on your part of the country, the new school year is only a matter of days or weeks away.\nIt\u2019s the season of new action-hero backpacks, freshly sharpened pencils, the aroma of fresh crayons, and the bustling commotion back-to-school open houses.\nParents and students eagerly fill the halls, crowding around the lists hung neatly on the walls to see which class, which friends, which teachers will be part of creating the year ahead.\nAnd also a bit terrifying. As much as hope factors into a new, unseen adventure, so does fear, especially if you are the parent of a child who learns or behaves in a slightly (or obviously) different way. For these parents, it\u2019s often less about seeing if their son\u2019s best friend is in the class as it is about if their son will MAKE a friend in this class. It\u2019s less about did we get the teacher the moms at the grocery store said was the best, and more about will the teacher \u201cget\u201d my daughter, will she be able to see her creativity beneath her blurting out, will she understand that that IS my son\u2019s best work, even if it appears to be hurried and scribbled.\nAs a parent of a struggling student myself, I know that feeling oh-too-well. As a professional who has had the privilege of ushering in new school years with hundreds of families of unique kids, I\u2019ve shared this crazy mix of hope and caution over many tables and cups of coffee.\nWithout exception, what almost always happens, is we realize we are holding our breaths. We are almost afraid to dream of all the remarkable possibilities in case they don\u2019t manifest. We are preparing for battles that most of us will never even have to fight. We are holding our breath as we armor up for the unknown.\nThere is a reason that breathing is a critical part of the labor and birth process. It is through the deep, focused, measured breaths that we move forward into the unknown. It prepares our brains and bodies for what is to come. It slows our heart rates and clears our minds. It allows us to be present in the moment, without interference from past or future.\nYou\u2019ve got this! We\u2019ve got this! We will take it one step at a time. Together we\u2019ll rejoice over surprising victories, deal with frustration, and probably shed a tear or two. You won\u2019t be doing it alone. Let\u2019s not bring forward events of the past, and let\u2019s not anticipate so many things that likely won\u2019t happen.\nLet\u2019s JUST breathe! Take it one breath at a time. You\u2019ve got this!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T22:20:10Z", "url": "https://breakthroughlearningsolutions.com/blog/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Useful historical information can be hard to find. It's easy to find the big facts like when was the Viking raid on Lindisfarne, or even who did what at the Battle of Hastings.\nBut, for the Bard and Sigurd stories, I needed to know what are they ate in medieval northern England? Lots of steak & potatoes? Not even close. Potatoes are a New World vegetable and cows were more valuable for milk.\nAnd clothing? Doublet and Hose? (Nope, that's more rennaissance), tunic and leggings (probably), robes (for the upper classes).\nTwo of the more useful sites I found were unexpected.\nWould you believe out-of-copyright comic books? In particular, the Robin Hood comics published by Magazine Enterprises during the 1940s and 1950s had a text section describing life in medieval times. Robin Hood is a little out of period for Bard & Sigurd, but I pulled a few snippets from these articles.\nThe downside of things like the Digital Comic Museum or Comic Book Plus is that you can lose a few hours (or more) to The Spirit or other classic titles.\nThe other fun bit of research was two books by Paul Telegdi: Learning Berserk and Unlearning Berserk.\nThese are stories about the life of a norse slave in the early 11th century. Telegdi went into a lot of detail about how his characters lived, what they ate, how the portages between the North Sea and Black Sea were done, etc.\nThe books are good historical stories and fun reads, but the gravy for me was the level of research that went into them.\nAnd as free samples, you can't beat the price.\nMy research into Constantinople has led me to French Romantic painters, Assasin's Creed video game, and articles on belly dancing.\nAll of this is on top of the normal sorts of research like books and history websites.\nI should mention that Paul Telegdi has written other books, and they are good reads.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T15:25:38Z", "url": "http://cflynt.com/Blog/showBlog.htm?BLid=Blog,FCD73D2225B1682B4534A3353131E517", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "History: The Deviants (or DV8) are descendants of Team 7, the covert military strikeforce who were exposed to mutational chemical compounds by the intelligence community in order to make them superhuman. The \u0093Gen-Factor\u0094 of superhumanity was passed on to Team 7\u0092s children. Those children therefore become International Operations\u0092 targets, as Team 7 had gone into hiding. Some of this children -- now in their mid-to-late teens -- were rescued by rogue I.O. chief and Team 7 man John Lynch, and became the group Gen-13.\nDV8 were not. They are fully the creatures of crazed I.O. Science director Ivana Baiul. Therefore, what we\u0092re looking at here is the antithesis of nice clean Gen-13. They stayed with IO. And they are not pleasant people.\nBrought together by the deliciously amoral Ivana Baiul, the group consisted of the heat-sucker Frostbite, the animalistic Evo, the multiple-personality possessor Copycat, the brawny Powerhaus, the density-altering Sublime, and the pain/pleasure controller Bliss. This motley group of disruptive teens was led by the arrogant psionic Threshold, with the utterly insane Sideways Bob acting as the team's \"keeper\". The group was formed and funded by Ivana once she was excised from International Operations to act as a \"spoiler force\", snatching up various technology and items before other intelligence agencies could get their hands on it, and then auctioning it to the highest bidder.\nWarren Ellis' opening run on the title was relentlessly nihilistic. The characters at no point seemed an amiable bunch, and with nary an altruistic gene among them. But Ellis' sharp writing and strong characterization made me interested to see if they'd discover a hint of humanity, a glimpse of promise, within themselves. For example, in the second issue Ivana sends them to investigate and possibly recruit a cult-like group of gen-active teens. When the DV8 members realize these people (with names like Virginia Dentata) are even more degenerate and twisted than themselves, they kill the lot of them - which of course was precisely what Ivana wanted in the first place.\nThe members slowly realize they exist to be manipulated. As one character puts it, they're \"like mushrooms, kept in the dark and fed crap.\" But it was fascinating to see how they each coped with their situation, particularly during \"downtime\". Sublime saves a girl from committing suicide by breaking her leg, Bliss begins a disturbing relationship with her brother Threshold, the ever-bored Evo wanders the streets seeking drugs to distract him.

{"text": "Like most people I find it intimidating to cook a whole live lobster. So I love to cook with lobster tails, its simple to work with and I don\u2019t have to kill anything. Since lobster meat is delicate and sweet, I deviated from strong flavors but used some spices to enhance and compliment the lobster meat\u2026.\nThis curry is great for those new to Indian cooking as it does not use a ton of ingredients and is relatively simple to follow.\nVada is a South Indian savory fritter made with soaked lentils and usually fried to a golden crisp. This recipe is baked with little to no oil for a healthier alternative. I used green split pea unlike the typical split chana dal (dry split chickpea) for variation. This recipe works well with chickpeas, black lentil and other legumes.\nThe most important step is soaking the peas till it plumps up three times their size. I soak the peas for a minimum of 12 \u2013 24 hours to make it easier to digest. Change the soaking water every 3-4 hours, till the water is clear and free of bubbles. Add a pinch of sea salt when soaking overnight to draw out the gas which will form bubbles on top of the water. Be sure to use cold water when rinsing and soaking the peas. Changing the soaking water and adding some sea salt helps reduce bloating and uncomfortable gas associated with legumes.\nIn the above the picture you see the difference between dry and soaked split peas. Another advantage to soaking the peas for 12-24 hours is the peas grind smoother and cooks evenly\u2026.\nLumpia is a fried spring roll made with minced meat and a variety of vegetables, made famous as the Filipino eggroll. Some varieties are fried with raw pork or beef, others with cooked filling. For safety reasons I like to fully cook my meat before filling the lumpias.\nLumpias uses an array of vegetables but feel free use what is on hand and personal preference. The only substitutions I wouldn\u2019t make are garlic and red onion because they are the foundation of flavors. I used a series of colorful vegetables like sweet red bell peppers, crunchy celery, savory red onions, and crispy carrots. Soy sauce and rice wine vinegar are added to season the meat. The rice wine vinegar is mellow and sweet, great for balancing the salty bite of soy sauce. Rice wine vinegar is low in acidity, unlike other varieties of vinegars\u2026.\nTuna wrap is an easy healthy flavorful recipe that is great for lunch or dinner. This recipe isn\u2019t loaded with a million spices and complicated steps, it\u2019s easy for anyone to make.\nThis recipe uses canned white albacore tuna. I\u2019m not a fan of dark fish meat because it\u2019s too musky. The albacore tuna can be quite meaty as it is canned as a portion of a tuna steak. I break it apart with my hand so it\u2019s flaky and can evenly disperse with the vegetables. Squeeze as much water out of the tuna as you can otherwise the final dish will be watery.\nThe combination of vegetables used are light and flavorful. The vegetables are finely minced to speed up the cooking process and blend with the flaked tuna. The base flavor for the tuna are minced red onion, ginger, garlic and chili. The green bell pepper and celery are savory and give a slight crunch. The turmeric powder gives a depth of flavor and the chili powder gives spiciness. These spices combined give the tuna a beautiful orange hue\u2026.\nThis is a healthy recipe using a whole red snapper. Seems imitating? Luckily the fish monger does most of the hard work of gutting and removing the scales of the fish. I love red snapper because of its delicate white meat. But any medium sized white fleshed fish would work just as well\u2026.\nIf you\u2019re craving a spicy hearty Indian chicken recipe that is somewhat easy\u2026this dish is for you!\nMaking a paste marinade allows the spices and fresh ingredients to seep into the chicken, tenderizing it and insuring it will be succulent. Roughly chop the red onion (you can substitute with white onion), ginger, bird\u2019s eye chilies, and crush the garlic. It makes it easier for the food processor or handheld emulsifier to grind through. I leave the curry leaves whole before I grind them, since the leaves are not fibrous. Curry leaves give the dish a distinct earthy floral flavor, mainly used in South Indian dishes. Most grocery stores carry it, but if you are out of luck, substitute with cilantro\u2026.\nThis recipe is a healthy delicious vegetarian dish. If you\u2019re not a fan of a particular vegetable, try roasting it and you might be surprised! Slowly roasting the vegetables allows any existing sugar content to caramelize. So the vegetable is left sweet, nutty, and earthy which melts in your mouth.\nThe combination of vegetables I used in this recipe is great, but feel free to use what you have on hand, or according to your personal preference. To make this dish more filling I used mainly root vegetables like parsnips, carrots, turnips, beets, potatoes and cauliflower. Also I added aromatic vegetables for flavor, like green bell pepper, red onion, and the garlic. All the vegetables are cut to roughly one inch pieces, to ensure even cooking\u2026.\nThese baked chicken wings have the same crispiness and guilty pleasure of fried wings, but without gallons of wasted oil or exploding wing particles!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T22:03:12Z", "url": "http://www.tikkaa.com/author/tikkaa/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Communication Sites in SharePoint Online are now rolling out to a tenant near you. This is one of the larger releases from the SharePoint team recently and has been a point of focus since the Virtual Summit earlier this year.

We now see site classification and usage guidelines.\nInterestingly enough, these are the options that are configurable within Azure AD for Office 365 Groups management.\nAnd last but not least we have a new choose your design section on the left.\nAs of initial release we have 2 preset designs of Topic and Showcase and then a blank design.\nI really like the idea of preset designs. I hope this is an area that will be opened up to allow new designs that you create to be added as communication site design templates.\nThe Topic and Showcase site designs are easy starting points to meet common needs and begin guiding page/content creation which is always a struggle for intranets. Both the Topic and the Showcase site design come preconfigured with web parts on the page.\nI am not sure of the technical reason for this but if you don't have the ability to create an Office 365 Group you won't be able to create a communication site. Even though you need this permission, an Office 365 Group is NOT created.\nAfter you clicked create, the actual process of creating the site was ridiculously fast. There is still quite a bit of work to do to personalize a site but the new web parts such as the hero and stream web part are great starting points for content delivery.\nI assume this will be resolved when the new admin portal comes out. For now if you want to see a list of your communication sites you will have to use PowerShell.\nThere is only 1 collection of navigation for top and left. This can be edited either in a library or on a site page. You can edit directly on these pages by clicking the edit link next to navigation.\nHere is some more support information for updating navigation. If you change the navigation it will be reflected on both the site pages and within the libraries and list pages.\nWith the release of communication sites we finally get more than single column page layouts. Personally I didn't think it was possible to create a super useful page in the modern framework without using more than 1 column so I think this is a huge improvement. This is also not just for communication sites but you can now have multi column layouts on all modern sites.\nNow if you are on a communication site and want to create a new page, the easiest way is through the + New option right below top navigation.\nThis is the kind of flexibility we have been needing for building pages in SharePoint Online within the modern experience.\nWhat else and what's next?\nCommunication sites are being rolled out to first release users and then full first release tenants. Worldwide rollout targeted for August 2017 and all of this includes the new web parts and sections layouts.\nThe publishing infrastructure continues to be supported.\nCommunication sites can support external users as long as the SharePoint site is configured to allow external sharing.\nMobile apps are being updated to support communication sites.\nJoin a communication sites AMA on Wednesday, June 28th 2017 from 9-10 a.m. PDT.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T05:30:15Z", "url": "https://concurrency.com/blog/june-2017/first-look-at-communication-sites-in-sharepoint-on?feed=Blog", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The overpayment scam is another time-honored classic that's made a successful leap to the online world. It goes like this: A business (usually a small, seemingly vulnerable one) receives a check from a buyer, usually of a big-ticket item. But suddenly there's a hitch \u2014 the buyer has mistakenly written the check for more than the correct amount. To avoid the trouble of writing another check, the buyer asks that the check be deposited and the difference wired back to them. We all know where this is going, right? The check bounces, the wire transfer is gone, the scammer is untraceable and the business owner is also responsible for bank fees.\nOverpayment scams are pretty easy to avoid with just a few safeguards. There are so many warning signs with these cons that you should be able to stop things before they start. A no-check policy would instantly solve the problem, and it's also best to steer clear of wire transfers. If you must accept checks for some reason, always ask for all of the buyer's contact information and then double-check \u2014 or, better yet, deal with them in person and ask for a check from a local bank. Wait for checks to clear before you use any of the funds and, above all, never accept a check for more than the agreed-upon amount.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T02:40:14Z", "url": "https://money.howstuffworks.com/10-online-scams-that-target-small-businesses7.htm", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Call It Arson plays out of the Old Saybrook area of Connecticut, probably about an hour and a half from where I used to live. Being so close, they've become a local favorite, and rightfully so. I think they're one of the few musical acts around now that still make original music. You can tell that the individual styles of the members all contribute to the bands overall sound, which I always find interesting. They've managed to create a heavy aesthetic while retaining acoustic and folk rock elements to their songs; the harmonica and acoustic guitar are always as audible as the driving low end. Singers James Downes and Ryan White have very distinct, unique qualities to their voices that blend and mesh like they were from the same family.\nThey're one of the few bands in the area who are seeing some success, having shared the stage with bands like Cursive and The Appleseed Cast. On May 20th of 2008, Call It Arson released \"Moth Wash: The Old Flames Seven Inch\" which features a lonely two songs but comes with an MP3 download of all the files. Moth Wash is the latest of three releases since 2006, after \"The Animal Strings Album\" and \"Call It Arson\" a self titled, 10 track album. Look for Call It Arson on Kill Normal Records, alongside bands like They And The Children, Stab You In The Head and The Flaming Tsunamis.\nHere are some of our first MP3 downloads on My Son Cool. These songs are great and everyone should hear them, but if you like these songs please support this band and their music. All of these CD's are available on the Kill Normal Website for cheap.\nI'll be totally honest, if I had my way I'd have different songs on here but we do what we can. You might not be able to download them, but go to the Call It Arson myspace and listen to \"Eliza\" and \"Sharpie,\" my two favorite songs of theirs, just take my word for it. Both songs are beautiful and haunting in their almost anthem-like composition. \"Sharpie\" shares the mentality of \"There's A Way To Be On,\" being the other track from Moth Wash.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T00:22:35Z", "url": "http://mysoncoolny.blogspot.com/2009/02/call-it-arson-moth-wash-old-flames.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Spotting Space Launches; Prime Sites for Free Viewing.\nI\u2019m always surprised how many everyday (i.e. non-space buffs!) I meet that fail to realize that space shots are visible to millions on almost a monthly basis. It\u2019s almost as if the space program is this exotic thing that happens in strange and remote places, far from the eyes of the general public. But the reality is that it may be easier to spy a launch than you might think, and anyone can easily see the International Space Station or the Space Shuttle with the naked eye while it\u2019s in orbit. There are about a half dozen spaceports worldwide that see at least monthly action, but for this post, we\u2019ll talk about the two most famous; Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and the Kennedy Space Center.\nLast year, we were able to attend the STS-125 launch at the KSC; prices for general admission currently go for about $38 dollars US. Viewing was from the visitor center complex grounds, and while I wouldn\u2019t deter anyone from the experience, we were still quite some distance away! You won\u2019t see the shuttle sitting on the pad, and it will only be visible seconds after it clears the tree-line. It\u2019s interesting to note that while the mainstream media generally ignores the manned spaceflight program, tickets for launch viewing also tend to sell out fast. In fact, if the quick sellout of tickets for next week\u2019s STS-132 mission are any indication, a vast counter-movement of space enthusiasts exists that isn\u2019t being served by the mass media. In fact, STS-132 viewing tickets appeared on EBay at magnitudes above the sale price hours after the sellout!The good news is you don\u2019t have to sell the car (or a kidney) to see a launch. Several off-site areas exist where you can spy launches. If you find yourself along the Florida space coast or in the Orlando area, I invite you to keep an eye on the sky\u2026 we can even spot launches from the backyard of Astroguyz HQ, about 100 miles to the west! What follows are some tips and advice, both official and unofficial, from readers, followers, sources and personal trial and error experiences.\nThe first and foremost thing you\u2019re going to want is information. When is the next launch? SpaceFlightNow is a daily \u201cmust look at\u201d for us; it updates launches and schedules of spaceports worldwide. Keep in mind; there are only three shuttle launches left in the program! Unmanned launches are always cool as well, and look dramatically different in appearance as their payload is generally lighter than the multi-million ton shuttle. Launches out of the Cape also tend to have a more easterly track out to sea, while shuttle launches have to match up with the International Space Station in its 51.6\u00b0 degree orbit and thus follow a more northeasterly track up the U.S. seaboard. For in-the-field satellite tracking, I point you towards the outstanding stand-alone free-ware resource Orbitron; just remember to update those TLEs occasionally to assure currency. Celestrak is also another ultimate resource for data, and CALsky will even give you custom built e-mail alerts for such events as dockings, solar and lunar transits, and decaying satellites. And don\u2019t forget to follow @Astroguyz on Twitter for the latest launch updates!\nThe official NASA page lists some areas of interest for off-site viewing: It also mentions that audio transmissions for amateur radio operators are at 146.94 MHz and boaters can tune to Channel 16 VHF-FM for Coast Guard instructions on restricted areas during launch. Keep in mind, boats aren\u2019t allowed north of mile marker 15 on the Banana River, and photography from a moving boat may be tricky, though not impossible.\nAn interesting site complete with diagramed maps comes to us via Peter Vidani and his Space Shuttle Launch Viewing Recommendations. He notes that Port Canaveral has the optimal viewing locale for launches out of the Cape, but may be used for KSC launches as well. Parrish Park is noted as another prime site, as it is only 12 miles from launch pad 39A. Construction at the Max Brewer Bridge has, however, limited parking. He also notes that while Space View Park is wired up with an audio feed from Mission Control; arrive early, as it gets very crowded!\nVeteran launch photographer Ben Cooper also echoes the above, stating that; \u201cSpace View Park is definitely a fan favorite, because it has trees and monuments and a pier\u2026a very nice place compared to just being at the side of the road or something. (As for) Tips and tricks\u2026get there early, earlier is always better even if it is too early, you can\u2019t go wrong getting a good spot. Everyone arrives at different times but leaves at once, so expect major traffic jams after the launch or scrub.\u201d Make sure you are also flexible in your viewing plans, as launches can and do frequently scrub. High profile launches, such as last year\u2019s Hubble repair or the final up-and-coming shuttle flight draw the largest crowds, but even a run of the mill telecommunications launch can be interesting\u2026 you might even catch something unusual, such as when the Solar Dynamics Observatory \u201cpierced\u201d a solar halo during launch earlier this year! Mr. Cooper\u2019s site also gives an excellent rundown of Titusville viewing areas, as well as examples of his own launch photography.\nGenerally speaking, a night launch will provide a better contrast against the night sky; I usually shoot a few calibration shots before launch to have some idea of what shutter speeds I can get away with; remember, digital film is cheap. My usual setup is a video camera mounted and running on a tripod and a hand held DSLR, with NASA TV running in the background. Keep in mind that NASA TV does have a time delay; you may well see the shuttle a few seconds before launch is broadcast. Dawn and dusk launches are the ultimate, such as the recent outstanding STS-131 launch. Keep an eye on the sky directly afterwards, as glowing neon clouds may be seen high in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. These are the results of condensation in the wake of a launch contrail, and can be equally photogenic.\n- Be ready and flexible for changing light conditions; a night-time launch can quickly turn into daytime conditions. I always shoot on manual, and try to pre-focus on a bright planet or the Moon if available.\n- Know your equipment: this is a basic one that\u2019s often overlooked. Give all gear a through \u201cshakedown\u201d before launch day and make sure all batteries are topped off\u2026 in astrophotography, the devil frequently lurks in the details!\n- Scout out a good foreground; scenery can make a good photo great. Such landmarks as the Disney castle, the Intracoastal Waterway Bridge in Ponte Vedra, palm trees, or the Moon add individuality to a shot. Check the azimuth of the launch pad against your viewing position so you know where the launch will be visible before hand; if you use the same sight frequently, note any land marks for future use.\n- Finally, don\u2019t shoot video in the vertical position! I know this from my own experience; I failed to realize during the STS-125 launch that the software wouldn\u2019t \u201cde-rotate\u201d the video the same as stills. Hey we\u2019re big enough to admit our own mistakes.\n- Binocs are handy for sighting booster separations; I\u2019ve seen the SRB detachment from a 100 miles away with our Canon IS 15x45s.\n- And don\u2019t forget those non-photography related issues; be prepared for heat, UV, and bugs in the summer; Florida nights in the winter can be surprisingly chilly. Twitter follower @Dangerbarrow ) suggests packing a lunch, arriving several hours early and viewing from Titusville on the river would a fine way to spend a launch spotting-day.\nWhy not view the launch from a kayak? Adventure Central offers a unique tour viewing from Mosquito Lagoon that gives you an unrestricted and unique vantage point. While not free, the $32 is a fraction of the KSC viewing price. Thanks to our friend Donna Frose teaching in Quito, Ecuador for sending this one our way!\nFlorida residents can also write their congress-person and request to view a launch; most elected officials in Florida recognize the value of the space industry and are thrilled to give their constituents a chance to see it in action, up close. Thanks to Ruth Arnold in Miami for bringing this to our attention.\nFinally, why not join a NASAtweetup? These media events are raffled off periodically, and provide up-close access to launches and interviews with astronauts. Entry is open to anyone over 18 years of age with a Twitter account; simply follow the NASAtweetup page religiously, as event notifications frequently come and go.\nAnd speaking of which, we here at Astroguyz are T-minus one week until departure for the STS-132 launch and the NASAtweetup! Follow this space as we track Atlantis in its final flight to the International Space Station\u2026we promise we\u2019ll keep the video camera in horizontal mode this time!\nEditor\u2019s Note: And for those partaking in a day tour of the KSC, check out these money saving tips from Wise Bread.com!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T06:08:13Z", "url": "http://astroguyz.com/tag/spaceflight/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "What does it take to get a start-up going? Well, nothing much; just a great idea, a few devoted professionals and, of course, funds. Helical IT Solutions seems to have them all. A company that started its operations in November 2012, it has already earned funds from an international investor and is poised to grow in a domain where growth is almost guaranteed-open source technology.\nHelical IT Solutions Pvt Ltd deals with Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence (DWBI). The founders of the company, Nikhilesh Tiwari and Nitin Sahu, chose the open source way because they are sure that if there is any domain in which growth is guaranteed, it is in open source technology. The range of services provided by the company include data warehousing, data visualisation, BI, ETL (extract, transfer and load), mobile and self-services BI, geographical charting, etc.\nThe two bank on open source not because it is a trend, but because they have learnt and understood the pros and cons of it over the years. Their tryst with open source began in their previous jobs, which they left to start their venture. Tiwari says, \u201cIn our previous companies we were working on open source BI technologies. According to the latest report by Gartner, the Indian BI sector is growing at 16 per cent and is expected to touch US$ 113 million in 2013 and US$ 172 million by 2016. Not only in India but worldwide, BI is one sector that is growing the fastest in the IT sector.\n\u201cSo we thought of moving to the next level with our company. With the recession and sluggish economies, more and more companies are trying to adopt open source technologies because of the low cost of ownership. Seeing this kind of market growth and the higher adoption of OSBI technologies, we thought of monetising this trend. This led to our searching for clients, and even before starting our company full time, we had three paying clients with us,\u201d Tiwari adds.\nSince the team was already working on different BI tools, it could easily offer consultancy to its clients regarding what would be the best tool to adopt, whether or not they ought to purchase the enterprise edition of that BI tool, etc. Hence, not only was Helical developing the client\u2019s solution, it was also acting as a consultancy.\nHaving begun the journey with open source technology, both Tiwari and Sahu want to continue down that path in the future as well. Tiwari explains that the biggest benefit open source technology brings is that without any compromise on the quality, the cost of ownership is the lowest. Hence, for SMEs and start-ups that have cost constraints, but do not want to compromise on the quality, open source technology is the best choice. He asserts, \u201cWith sluggish economies in the US and EU, we are now also approaching medium-sized companies, since they want to reduce their expenses and overheads. OSBI technologies often turn out to be 70-90 per cent more cost effective as compared to their proprietary competitors like SAP, SAS, IBM Cognos, etc.\u201d The company currently has a team of eight people and will continue to hire to meet the requirements that come with its growth.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T16:23:46Z", "url": "https://opensourceforu.com/2014/02/successful-start-chose-go-open-source-way/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "I had another debate with my friend again regarding the cost of living in Singapore. Naturally, we referred to the article below, titled \"Inflation could hit 5% early next year, then taper off\", and argued about the notion of \"spending less = lower cost of living = lower standard of living?\".\nMr Lim, Singapore\u2019s Minister for Trade and Industry, commented that by spending on alternative, cheaper goods, we can effectively lower the cost of living. However, some people seem to interpret that as lowering the standard of living.\nInstead of saying that \u201cswitching to cheaper products can reduce the cost of living\u201d, Minister Lim would have been more accurate to say, \u201cswitching to cheaper products can lower the standard of living\u201d. For example, instead of living in a 5-room HDB flat, you can live in a 1-room HDB flat (a cheaper product). Instead of having chicken rice and vegetables for lunch, you can just eat plain porridge (a cheaper product).\nLiving in a 1-room HDB flat and eating plain porridge constitutes a lower standard of living. So yes, by switching to cheaper products, you can lower your standard of living. And a lower standard of living does cost less to maintain.\nMy friend shared the perception that, by spending on (possibly) lower quality (and hence cheaper) goods, there will be less demand for the costlier goods. Given such a scenario, it is possible for the costlier goods to cost cheaper since the demand is now lowered. After all, economics is all about demand and supply \u2013 and hence Mr Lim\u2019s advice is not entirely wrong.\nHe also added that, it is not possible for everyone to stop spending \u2013 so people should spend less \u2013 perhaps on cheaper products, but not entirely stop spending because the entire economy will collapse. Thus to prevent either extremes from happening \u2013 (i) goods getting costlier (ii) economy collapsing, Singaporeans have to start spending moderately so that both goals become achievable.\nFrom the point of economics, I have to agree with his points. However, the entity that we are talking about are humans, and not robots, and so a greater amount of PR has to be injected while getting people to face reality.\nMr Lim had been infamous for his statements when he was the health minister, which includes asking the women to \"save on one hairdo and use the money for breast screening\", his regret in intervening to admit a premature baby to KKH to save the baby\u2019s life because \"\u2026in the end, the baby continued to be in intensive care, and KKH now runs up a total bill of more than $300,000\u2026\", and his call to raise hospital rates to hotel rates because \"if these patients (hospital overstayers) want to treat hospitals like a hotel, then they\u2019ll have to be charged hotel rates.\", of whom mostly are likely to be older than 60, with no income, or are from families with incomes below $1000.\nAS CONSUMER prices continue to rise, inflation in Singapore will likely surge to 4 or 5 per cent in the first quarter of next year.\nBut it should taper off by the second half of the year to \u2018more normal conditions\u2019, said Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang yesterday.\nThe average rate for next year should be around 3 per cent.\nFuelled mainly by rising global oil and food prices, inflation recorded a 13-year high of 2.9 per cent in August. It is expected to dip to 2.7 per cent in the last quarter, Mr Lim told Parliament.\nBut it was his 2008 forecast that made analysts and consumers sit up yesterday.\nCitigroup economist Chua Hak Bin said that the 5 per cent rate predicted would be a \u2018historic high\u2019 in the 25 years since 1983. The previous high was in July 1991, when it hit 4 per cent.\nMost economies, including Singapore\u2019s, size up inflation by tracking the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. The CPI measures the cost of a basket of goods and services consumed by most households.\nYesterday, Mr Lim cautioned against \u2018interpreting a rise in the headline CPI as necessarily reflecting an increase in the cost of living\u2019.\nIt depends on the individual household\u2019s spending. \u2018Switching to cheaper products can reduce the cost of living despite a rise in the CPI,\u2019 he added.\nA CPI increase may also not reflect actual hikes in consumer prices. For instance, flat prices soared, but flat owners do not pay rent.\nHigher inflation, he said, should also be viewed against rapid economic growth, with the gross domestic product rising more than 6 per cent on average since 2003 and wages also on the up.\nHowever, MPs such as Madam Halimah Yacob worry that residents, especially the elderly on fixed incomes, are feeling the pinch. \u2018They go to the market with a similar sum of money. But they can buy less,\u2019 she said.\nHe sketched out how the landscape will look like next year.\nExplaining why there will be a spike in inflation before it plateaus, he cited two reasons: First, it is as compared to the first quarter of this year, when inflation was at 0.5 per cent and oil prices were low.\nSecond, the \u2018one-off\u2019 effect of the goods and services tax hike, which will be felt until next June.\nThereafter, the trend will \u2018revert to more normal conditions in the second half of next year\u2019.\nThe numbers come against a global backdrop of rising oil and food prices, such as more expensive chicken due to costlier feed. Adverse weather in food-supplying countries has also reduced supply, even as demand has risen.\nDiversifying sources is one way to maintain more stable food prices, Mr Lim said, but there was a limit to this given the worldwide increase in food prices being seen now.\nBut inflation has not affected Singapore\u2019s economic competitiveness, he said.\n\u2018We are tracking our competitiveness position very closely and so far we are in quite a good position,\u2019 he said, adding that inflation here was lower than in other countries.\nHe noted that imported inflation has been reduced because of the policy of gradually appreciating the Singapore dollar.\nOther watchers suggest more aggressive measures. Citigroup\u2019s Dr Chua, for instance, believes that the economy is in danger of overheating.\nHe called on the Government to re-prioritise projects, given that unemployment is already at a low.\nPrevious: Plans for today (like who will bother).. haha..", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T18:23:12Z", "url": "http://blog.simplyjean.com/2007/11/17/debate-over-standards-of-living-part-1/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Seaton Parkrun Review 11/08/18 \u2013 Too many pebbles!\nAnother parkrun ticked off on the list, and probably not one many people have heard of.\nThis week I\u2019m on holiday in Lyme Regis, so we checked out the closest parkrun and luckily Seaton parkrun was only ten minutes in the car.\nAnyway, the course, which was on the seafront ala Hastings, started on the pebble beach. For the first time in a while I tried a sprint start. Running over pebbles isn\u2019t easy, I\u2019ll tell you that much, and it wasn\u2019t going to be the last I saw of them either.\nAs I got onto the concrete path this shorter guy flew past me. Looking at the results from last week, the winner got a time of 16:32, so I thought it could\u2019ve been him.\nThere was a turning at Yacht Club at about 1.5k where we had to run on pebbles for another 100 metres, we did the loop twice so it probably knocked a bit off my time.\nI liked the fact that we ran up and down the seafront four times, it allowed you to break up the race in smaller chunks rather than one long path.\nI dropped my pace towards the middle but managed to pick it up again for the finishing kilometre.\nI\u2019m not sure why but I always seem to speed up after a turning, luckily for me there were a lot of them on the course, as well as volunteers who were great as usual.\nIn terms of my time, it\u2019s an improvement on last week which is what I was expecting now I\u2019m starting to train regularly again. All there is to do now is find some long run routes for the mornings here in Dorest and I\u2019ll be pretty much sorted.\nIn other news, apparently my aunt saw Robbie Williams walking down by the beach earlier; a man who\u2019s met Lawrence McKenna.

{"text": "This article appeared in the September, 23, 2011 edition of the Davis Enterprise.\nExplorit Science Center welcomes you back to its Mace Ranch Park facility for the opening of its new Forces of Nature exhibit. The exhibit opens Saturday, October 1 at 1:00pm at 3141 5th Street in Davis.\nExplorit Science Center has been housed in Mace Ranch Park since 1992, but the facility itself has a much longer history. A historic home owned by the Mace Ranch Investors, the Mace Ranch House was first built in 1951 on the site of a hundred-year-old farm and cattle ranch.\nThe land known as Mace Ranch Park entered into written history in the mid-nineteenth century as part of a Mexican land grant. In 1850 Col. Joseph Ballinger Chiles purchased the Mace Ranch Park portion of the grant.\nChiles planted grain, raised horses and cattle and erected a two-story family home near where the Mace Ranch House stands today. That home stood until the 1950s when the current house was built.\nAs the Chiles family grew, the ranch was divided and diversified. Grain and horses gave way to sheep farming, and later alfalfa and sugar beets.\nWhen the C. Bruce Mace family purchased a portion of the original Chiles ranch land, they farmed it with tomatoes, wheat and alfalfa. They built and lived in the Mace Ranch House until 1985.\nSix years later, Explorit Science Center negotiated our current tenancy with the home\u2019s owners, Mace Ranch Investors, who had purchased the property in 1981. Explorit moved in the next spring on the occasion of our tenth anniversary.\nExplorit has maintained offices in Mace Ranch Park ever since. Now, on the cusp of turning 30, Explorit has returned its exhibit space to its roots in Mace Ranch Park.\nThe new exhibit, Forces of Nature, explores the science in the world all around us. From the principles of flight to the power of continental drift, visitors will experience the wonders of movement in our lives.\nYoung children will also enjoy investigating a variety of activities geared for those five and under in our Discovery Den. And no visit to Explorit would be complete without dropping in to our animal alcove to greet Connie the ball python or Blizzard the blue tongue skink.\nSo as Explorit comes home to Mace Ranch Park, we invite you to join us on Saturday, October 1 from 1:00-5:00pm. We will be open the first weekend of the month, Saturday and Sunday 1:00-5:00pm beginning October 1. And be sure to like us on Facebook to stay up to date with all our news.\n\u2022 Saturday and Sunday, October 1st and 2nd from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m: Explorit\u2019s newest Exhibition, \u201cForces of Nature\u201d opens. This exhibition welcomes the public back to our 3141 5th Street Nature Center and will feature some of the best of Explorit\u2019s past exhibits.\nExplorit Science Center is located at 3141 5th St. and is open to the public every first Saturday and Sunday of the month.

{"text": "Recently, we went to breakfast with some friends of ours and their 2 1/2 year old son. While the adults were talking, the young toddler wanted to speak to his mother. Almost simultaneously, both parents gave their child a non-verbal sign. They crossed their pointer fingers and middle fingers and showed the sign to their child\u2026 almost immediately, he stopped. He waited patiently for three or four minutes until the discussion was completed. At that point, the parents asked him what he wanted to say and he shared his idea while everyone listened. As I\u2019m watching this, I\u2019m thinking\u2026IF ONLY!!!\nMy TBP has always struggled with patience, but having to wait to share his thoughts, remains one of the biggest challenges. It seems to be worse when we are driving in the car. His continued perception is that we don\u2019t allow him any time to talk. It doesn\u2019t seem possible to us (or our ears), but we try to check ourselves to make sure that we are actively listening in between our discussions.\nOutside of the car, we have the same issue. I might be watching a show or working, and my TBP doesn\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t want to stop immediately to see the latest village he has made in Mine Craft. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026I adore him. Anyone that knows me, knows that he is the center of my world but\u2026 this constant need for attention and not wanting to wait is exhausting. Just today, I was putting laundry away upstairs and I heard him scream for me. I dropped the laundry, ran downstairs, and shouted his name to see what had occured. I was out of breath when I said, \u201cAre you okay. What\u2019s wrong?!\u201d He said quietly, \u201cNothing\u2026I just needed you.\u201d While this sounds sweet (and I\u2019m glad that he wants me near him) it is the interrupting and need for immediate attention that is frustrating.\nWe have noticed that the interrupting increases at certain times. When he is tired or hungry, he doesn\u2019t seem to have the ability to control his impulsiveness. If school has been especially challenging or there is an activity coming up that he is anxious about, we have to be prepared for a bit more frequent check ins. Understanding and preparing for this, has been a preventive measure that we didn\u2019t understand in years past. We also make a deliberate effort to spend 15-20 minutes a day giving him 100% of our attention (no cell phones, texting, or multi-tasking) in addition to the bedtime routine and reading. This usually is enough, but on tough days, more time might be needed. Actually on really rough days, no amount of attention seems to be enough! I\u2019m sure many of you understand oh so well what I\u2019m talking about here!\nInterrupting is annoying to me and to others (especially those without children). The ability to wait and not interrupt, seems to be one of the most important pillars of good manners. Because of this, we continue to work on it and compliment him when he is able to wait. If you are the parent of a TBP, you know that we do not accept these controlling and manipulative behaviors sitting down. It\u2019s just sometimes, we NEED to sit down for that moment. And then before too long, we get back up and try it again!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T20:23:56Z", "url": "https://mytwicebakedpotato.com/2012/05/28/mama-mama-mama/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "As an Occupational Therapist, I have always strived to maintain good sitting posture, be aware of my office ergonomics and live a healthy and active lifestyle. So it is somewhat alarming to realise that 30 minutes of exercise every day is not enough to counter-act the effects of sitting all day at work.\nFrom a personal perspective I was quietly excited to think that there was something else that I could do for my health rather than face that run that I dread every afternoon, but from a professional perspective I realised that it would be a challenge to change the habits and expectation of what a typical office worker should do all day\u2026\u2026.SIT.\nResearchers have linked sitting for long periods of time with a number of health concerns, including obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol levels.\nResearch shows that reduced sitting could have a considerable impact on cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.\nThe health burden associated with insufficient physical activity is likely to far exceed the health burden of associated computer-related musculo-skeletal disorders.\nHumans weren\u2019t designed to be so immobile \u2013 just think back to our hunter-gatherer ancestors.

Now, we aren\u2019t cheap\u2014we'll tell you that upfront. We are a premium dog training service. We give you customized training programs, one-on-one attention, and a ton of other perks that we can discuss during your free consultation.\nVery similarly to any program with us, first we need some information from you. Fill out your information and make sure to specify that you are interested in Online Skype Training.\nDo Skype Dog Training Sessions actually work?\nAbsolutely! Part of our free consultation is to determine the program that works best for you and your dog so that you see the best results in the shortest amount of time possible. Because we are essentially training the people, not the dog, Skype sessions allow us to see the problems you are having and work you through them.

However, you found us and that\u2019s because we are very good at what we do. We\u2019ve been featured on Nat Geo Wild, Inspire Health Magazine, Autostraddle.com, and San Diego News 6.

This isn\u2019t a hobby or side job for us, like many dog trainers. This is our career. This is something we have studied, practiced, and dedicated our lives to.\nYou can see that in the two cities we work in we have an average Yelp rating of 4.9 stars! The trainers who helped achieve this rating are the same trainers you will be working with. We only use humane, positive reinforcement training techniques that get results. This is an opportunity to work with Los Angeles based all-star trainers without leaving your home.\nCan I use Facetime or another digital platform instead?\nOf course! In fact, sometimes we will ask our clients to Facetime problems that may be occurring out of site of the computer or outside of the house. This way we can \u201cbe there\u201d and observe everything you are seeing and give you the tools necessary to combat these behavioral problems.\nI am still skeptical about skype sessions. How do I know this will work?\nWe understand why you would be skeptical about digital dog training. This is obviously very different than the traditional dog owner-dog trainer relationship. While we can never guarantee training will work, (it all depends on your commitment and application of the tools we give you), we do have a track record that speaks for itself. If you are still skeptical, give us a chance! Sign-up for our free, no obligation, Skype consultation to see if we are a right fit for you. We will go over all your dog training goals, answer all of your questions, and prepare a customized program for you and your canine friend! At the end of the consultation if you are still not impressed, then there is no obligation!

{"text": "Fencing \u2013 will we never learn!\nThis morning we were awoken by a phone call. It was to tell us that some of our sheep had gone awandering. Again. Now this shouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise as they have been getting out recently, but I thought I\u2019d actually found their main egress route, and blocked it. Sadly I was wrong.\nUsually the escapees are the cross-bred boys, with the occasional pure bred Soay. None of the OAPs wander, I think they\u2019re quite happy where they are thank-you-very-much. This morning the usual suspects had been joined by all the other non-OAPs, for a total of twelve wandering sheep.\nWe quickly jumped into the car and drove round to where they\u2019d been spotted. We found them quickly, and I started towards them with my trusty bucket. Usually they would run towards me, but not today. They were rather spooked. I suspect that they\u2019d met a few people out walking their dogs and this had put them in rather a fluster. Instead we did the human sheep dog thing, and soon had them heading in the right direction. They\u2019d clearly had enough of an adventure, and were happy to be heading home. I stayed on after them, both to make sure they didn\u2019t change their minds, and also to see where they\u2019d got out, and within a few minutes they were all safely back in their field.\nRecently their method of escape has been to jump over the fence, so I was expecting them to jump back in. Instead they seemed to walk back in without any real problems. When I got to that part of the fence I found that a whole section had come loose, and they could just walk in and out. I was rather lucky the cows hadn\u2019t decided they needed to wander as well!\nWe got out the fencing supplies and went to work to fix up the fence, and we also took another look at all the other fencing to see what other weaknesses they might be exploiting. I have to admit that recently I\u2019ve only been looking at where they have been jumping, so have been a bit lax at checking the bottom of the mesh. It looks like they\u2019ve taken advantage of this and pushed it up in several places, and indeed that\u2019s how they\u2019d freed up the loose section. An hour or so later, with some judicious use of wooden beams, some random branches and a reasonable number of fencing staples, and I was relatively confident that the fencing would hold our escape committee for at least a few days.\nHowever, I also decided that wasn\u2019t going to be enough. Clearly those boys would continue challenging the fence, so I needed to do something about it. They\u2019re actually due to go on holiday fairly soon, so maybe it was time to move them in with the Borerays, who happen to be occupying the pre-holiday field at the moment. So next job is going to be to move them!\nAlso, obviously, at some point I\u2019m going to need to get the whole fence on the bottom field redone. Something else to look forward to.\nWhen we acquired the Borerays we gained not only two breeding ewes and a ram, but also two whethers and an old ewe. The old ewe we dubbed \u2018Duchess\u2019 and we both became fond of her. She was a very friendly ewe, and would usually run up to us whenever she saw us, and happily eat out of our hands, the only one of the Borerays to consistently do so.\nShe was rather old, and over the last few days has had problems standing. She was still eating fine, but was rather weak, and needed help to get up a couple of times. This morning when I went out to feed the sheep I found her in her little hut. She wasn\u2019t moving at all any more. I think she\u2019d only just died. Poor duchess, but at least she had a fair innings.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T06:17:06Z", "url": "http://jasonmgibbs.co.uk/wallowinginpoo/tag/boreray/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Maple sugar actually has 63 phytonutrients that give it antioxidant properties similar to berries, red wine and tea. Who knew?! Well I sure didn\u2019t.

So the antioxidants in maple sugar can actually help speed up your recovery time.

{"text": "Christmas shopping is a terrifying, stressful experience that we have to confront each and every year. It has the power to turn normally courteous and considerate people into raving lunatics with absolutely no sense of human decency. To do it well, to find gifts that will make your loved ones really feel loved, is a bit of an art that can take a lot of practice. I have some suggestions that will hopefully steer you in the right path and clear up some common misconceptions about the subject.\nFirst and foremost, it is absolutely essential to wait until the very last minute. We all know someone who gets all their shopping done before Thanksgiving, so that they can relax (and brag) all through December. This may seem like a good idea, but I assure you it\u2019s not. These people are not to be trusted. They are likely foreign spies or androids sent to destroy Christmas. Experienced shoppers know that the best ideas come when your back is against the wall, when you have think outside the box and really dig down to come up with that special gift. In truth, anything purchased before December 23\u2019rd is likely to be boring and uninspired.\nAnother common mistake is to read Christmas lists. This is an absolute no-no. Any hack can go out and buy something off a list of things their Mother-in-Law claims she actually wants. If you want to show someone that you love them, pick up something that you think they should have, maybe even something that you\u2019d really like for yourself. It shows that you are selfless as well as thoughtful. Your Mother in Law will greatly appreciate it and forget all about that little \u201cincident\u201d during Thanksgiving dinner.\nLastly, store selection is crucial. Since you should only have a few days (or hours) left before you buy a single gift, efficiency is everything. You\u2019ll want to choose a locale that is easy to get to and carries gifts for the whole family. Malls may seem like the obvious choice, but you should resist them at all costs. By the time you park your car and safely navigate to the necessary stores, it may already be too late. My advice is to hit up your nearest Wal-Mart or comparable all-in-one store. Also, remember that gas stations often have a wide variety of gifts to choose from and are easily accessible from the highway.\nHopefully these suggestions will make your holiday a little bit easier. Christmas can be a trying time, but if you follow my advice and trust your gut, you\u2019ll get through it. If not, there are always gift cards.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T17:01:58Z", "url": "http://www.stepbystep.com/A-Brief-Guide-to-Christmas-Shopping-for-the-Rest-of-Us-136211/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

It has 18 miles of trail cut into the hillsides.

This insures that you have earned a great downhill run through Bergman Gulch.\nFrom the Ridge parking lot, head out to Grand Junction. At the GJ kiosk, look to your right. Between the two trails is a fun single track which takes the rider to Chaos Corner. From there head on down Alley Oop and do that loop which will bring you back to Chaos Corner. Then head up Windsinger to Grand Junction. From there head up Ridge View or go out Morning Glory to 5-Corners. Hit Little Critter. Keep your eye open for the single track taking off to the right after you have ridden most of Little Critter. This will dump you at North Junction at the beginning of the 1.9 mile Gulch.

{"text": "I've started work on an autumn layout for my Seasons out of Time journal project, and it is going to involve cascades of beautiful autumn foliage falling down the pages, and I wanted it to be bright and vibrant and in shades of orange, red, brown, and yellow with hints of green maybe. I decided to combine my Dylusions ink sprays and Tim Holtz Distress spray stain to get the colours I wanted, prepare a tag as a good surface then stamp on some leaves I could later cut out and glue onto the layout once it's ready and then they'll stand out and look beautiful. This layout is called \"Les Feuilles Mortes\" (the dead leaves) after the 1945 song, which was re-released in English translation in the same year of course as \"Autumn Leaves\" - obviously because the layout is based on falling, autumn leaves.\nThis is by no means a complete project, just one of maybe a dozen elements that will make up this layout, but it made a beautiful autumnal colourway and I wanted to share that.\nSTEP 1: I first sprayed the tag in a generous coat of Lemon Zest rather than spraying it with water - the wetness will help the brighter, darker colours to blend and will fill any gaps with a beautiful yellow.\nSTEP 2: I sprayed Tangerine Dream and Fresh Lime over most of the tag.\nSTEP 3: Immediately, I switched to the Distress spray stain and added Carved Pumpkin and Vintage Photo. As you can see from the photo above, they don't all sit 'equally' on the page. The reason: Distress stains have a different density and hydrophobicity to the Dylusions products. To analogise firstly ionic strength. If you were to mix a very salty solution with pure tap water, you'll get all sorts of swirling and mixing and clear mixing lines visible in it (Schlieren as the Germans call it) - you can try it out and see - this is because one has far more salt dissolved in it and thus when it mixes with the other, they try and equal out and the salt tries to move around and equilibrate it - that's owing to both liquids having different densities - if you dissolve 200g of salt in 1,000mL water, then 1mL of that water has a mass of 1.2g (1mL water = 1g, plus the 0.2g salt in every 1mL), therefore, it has a density of 1.2g/mL - in short, they will try and equal out and you'll see mixing/swirling/etc happen, or, if they were mixed more slowly, the water will sit on top of the salt water and form separate layers. Hydrophobicity is a measure of how much something wants to adhere to surfaces and not be in a water-based solution - in this context, it's really a measure of \"does this dye molecule want to be joined to paper or in solution?\" - so what happens is that one of them adheres rapidly to the paper, one of them more slowly.\nWhat does this mean in practice? It means you get amazing patterns - you get the two different products mixing slowly and naturally and producing mixes of colour in close proximity without making mud.\nSTEP 4: I left it without touching it at all to dry for 24h and it looked beautiful! I then stamped the open/spotty leaves stamp from the Branching Out set onto it with Wendy Vecchi's beautiful Potting Soil Archival Ink - this is an oil-based ink so it won't lift the products underneath. I didn't apply it perfectly - I wanted a rough look. When my journal pages are ready, I will cut out all the whole leaves and adhere them to the pages individually. I LOVE the colours this has produced! Every leaf is totally unique and has texture and usually 2-3 colours. I had planned to stamp with some random texture over this to add interest but I really don't need to now!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T01:19:41Z", "url": "http://www.the-spin-doctor.co.uk/2017/09/seasons-out-of-time-layout-les-feuilles.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
