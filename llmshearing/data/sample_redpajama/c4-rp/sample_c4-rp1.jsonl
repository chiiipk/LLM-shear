{"text": "Discussion in 'Mac OS X Lion (10.7)' started by axboi87, Jan 20, 2012.\nI've got a 500gb internal drive and a 240gb SSD.\nWhen trying to restore using disk utility i'm given the error \"Not enough space on disk ____ to restore\"\nBut I shouldn't have to do that!!!\nAny ideas or workarounds before resorting to the above?\nUse Carbon Copy Cloner to copy one drive to the other. I've done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won't be bootable. CCC usually works in \"file mode\" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that's mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall).\nI've actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone. Definitely format the drive cloning to first, as bootable Apple etc..\nThanks for pointing this out. My only experience using DU to go larger to smaller was when I was trying to make a Lion install stick and I was unable to restore InstallESD.dmg to a 4 GB USB stick but of course the reason that wouldn't fit is there was slightly more than 4 GB of data.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T10:07:13Z", "url": "https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/restore-from-larger-disk-to-smaller-disk.1311329/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Sysco Corp. has terminated its planned $3.5 billion takeover of US Foods, it announced Monday, after a federal judge blocked the combination. The company is opting instead to add $3 billion to its stock-buyback program.\nWith the deal breaking up, Sysco will pay a $300 million termination fee to US Foods and a $12.5 million fee to Performance Food Group, which had agreed to buy some US Foods facilities. Sysco, based in Houston, plans to make the share repurchases over the next two years.\nRosemont, Illinois-based US Foods operates a major distribution center in Fishers. Sysco has a large warehouse at 4000 W. 62nd St., in Indianapolis.\nSysco had fought for more than a year to gain government approval for the transaction, which antitrust regulators said would hurt competition and lead to higher prices. Sysco and US Foods dominate a market known as broadline foodservice, which supplies school cafeterias, restaurants and hotels. Sysco had argued that the acquisition would bring $1 billion in savings, letting it offer lower prices to customers.\nInvestors have responded with relief to the deal\u2019s demise, reflecting concerns about the company undertaking an ambitious merger. Sysco shares rose 3.1 percent the day the transaction was halted by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, and the stock climbed again Monday morning after the merger was withdrawn.\nMehta blocked the merger on June 23 when he granted a Federal Trade Commission request to delay the transaction. The FTC had sued the companies in February, saying the deal would give Sysco an oversized share of an industry where it\u2019s already the biggest player.\nIn arguments before Mehta in May, the two sides clashed over the scope of the market in which the companies compete. Sysco and US Foods argued that the commission was relying on a \u201ctortured\u201d analysis, ignoring the variety of distribution channels available to customers.\nSysco said on Monday that it weighed embarking on an appeal but decided against it.\nShares of Sysco rose as much as 1.6 percent to $39 in early trading.

{"text": "\"Bake me a pie or go away,\" I've literally had my son say that to me a few times. So, what was I to do except fulfilling his demand? Baking (not only pies), is a cooking method where tools DO actually make the man, which means that it is very hard or nearly impossible to do it successfully without proper bakeware.\nWith years of experience under my belt, I\u2019ve learned about and discovered what truly matters when looking for bakeware to buy, and I am going to teach you later in the article.\nAlso, I have reviewed what I believe to be the best five non-stick bakeware sets out there, so make sure to check them out if you are in search of one.\nThe first and most obvious reason is \u2013 because food doesn\u2019t stick to it! I do not want to sound overly simplistic, but any chef (or mom, as a matter of fact) knows that pans that stick will absolutely mess up the outcome.\nPeople normally solve this problem by oiling up, but I don\u2019t like it since it makes the food greasy. Using non-stick bakeware is a healthier, more convenient, and more practical way of baking.\nThe next thing that you might not have known is that non-stick bakeware is so much easier to clean than more conventional types. It is a no-brainer really \u2013 if nothing sticks to the surface then there won\u2019t be anything to scrub, scrape or wash off.\nThis trait right here will save you tons of time as well as frustration, and it might motivate you to bake more often because of the hassle-free cleaning process. Just make sure to maintain the bakeware.\n\u200bLastly, even heat distribution is another thing that you should look for, and this type of bakeware enables it.\nHere's the deal: heat distribution most likely won't affect the quality of the result, but it will make the bakeware heat up more quickly which will ultimately decrease the cooking time.\nInvesting a little bit of time into research can save you a lot of money and trouble in the long run, and that is why you need to read this section carefully.\nBakeware sets differ regarding materials, abilities, cost, and maintenance, so learning about some general features of these products will help you decide which type will fulfill your demands.\nBakeware can be made from different kinds of materials including iron, glass, copper, steel, etc.\nToday I will mention only the types that are related to products I reviewed in this article.\nIt is important to know that each material yields different cooking properties so study these paragraphs to find out which one is right for you.\nCarbon steel \u2013 this material is light, durable, and reacts to temperature changes very quickly, meaning that it can heat up fast. Even though is lightweight, it is a bit heavier than copper and doesn't retain heat as well as iron. It's a good choice for baking meats, veggies, bread, and cakes.\nCopper \u2013 it is an excellent heat conductor and doesn\u2019t need pre-heating since it gets hot very quickly. Very light, but also quite expensive compared to other bakeware materials. Also, it isn\u2019t the best choice for recipes that require baking under very high heat.\nSilicon \u2013 good for foods where sticking is an issue, such as breads, cookies, and cakes. It is light, affordable and dishes will slide out of it easily. The one downside is that it can be frustrating to wash because it is so elastic, but luckily, most of the silicon bakeware is dishwasher safe.\nSince you\u2019ll be buying an entire set of products, it would be a good idea to find one that is suitable for all kinds of baking jobs. Make sure that all the basic items such as pie pan, muffin pan, loaf pan, cookie sheet, cake pan, or whatever you need, is included in the package.\nThis is a feature that most folks overlook, and it makes a world of difference when it comes to handling the pan. It's easy to move the dish around when it's cold but taking it out of a scorching hot oven is a different story (trust me, I know). You\u2019ll try to be cautious not to burn your fingers so it is easy not to pay attention to the contents of the pan which can lead to spillage and a messy kitchen.\nLook for bakeware that has nice, ergonomic handles or handling areas. Some models have silicon added to these parts for extra protection and ease of use.\nNot all types of bakeware can withstand the same temperatures; as a matter of fact, this trait greatly differs from product to product. Certain pans are oven safe to up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, while others cannot take more than 350.\nThis is a significant difference so pay close attention to this detail when buying a set.\nNow, let\u2019s get into the meaty part of this article \u2013 the reviews.\nAfter trying out many sets, I\u2019ve reached some conclusions and decided to put together a list of my favorite ones.\nKeep in mind that these are my personal choices, but they are also top rated products.\nRachel Ray is a world-renowned chef and TV personality, and her famous Cucina line of products never fails to deliver. Here, we are dealing with an excellent, 10-piece set that I personally think very highly of.\nThe material that this bakeware is made of is carbon steel, and the non-stick, latte-colored coating looks very pretty and does the job well.\nA thing that I didn\u2019t like about the construction of this set is that everything is so bulky. It is not a huge issue, but folks who lack storage space will not be thrilled with these products.\nAs far as items are concerned, the set includes two loaf pans, two cake pans, two cookie sheets, two pie plates, a muffin tin, and a plastic cake pan topper.\nIn my opinion, this is more than enough, but I\u2019m sure some folks are going to be disappointed because there\u2019s no pizza pan included.\nThe handles have silicon grips attached to them, and this is a big bonus when it comes to practicality and handling. Also, the rolled edges allow you to grab the pan more easily and move it around securely.\nThe pan can withstand heat of up to 450 F, and I think that this should be sufficient for most baking jobs. Make sure not to go over this temperature because you could burn the pans.\nCopper has gained a lot of popularity in the cooking world over the last few years, and honestly, I can only say good things about it. Copper Chef is known for a plethora of cookware, and now we are taking a look at their baking set.\nAs I've mentioned before, copper is a fantastic heat conductor, and the heat distribution in this material is as even as it gets.\nPersonally, I find the latter feature very important because I like to have consistency in my cooking.\nThis is a 12-piece set that consists of a 12-cup muffin pan, a cookie sheet, a loaf pan, a square pan, and eight pieces of silicon ramekin cups with lids.\nOk, so I think it is a bit unfair for a company to advertise a set of twelve copper products while only four of them are actually made of this material. While the ramekin cups are lovely, they seem to be a cheap filler in this set.\nAs far as handling is concerned, most of the products in this pack do not have handles, so you have to rely on the rolled edges for gripping. This is a big disadvantage in my opinion, and greatly handicaps the ease of use.\nThese black, sturdy-looking baking dishes remind me of old-school bakeware sets that people used to bake with a few decades ago. However, this is a modern and versatile set that should fulfill most of your demands.\nThe ChefLand set is made of carbon steel; it looks pretty plain but has a non-stick coating that's quite effective. One thing that this material is good at is even heat distribution, so you won\u2019t need to worry about hotspots.\nThe products are dishwasher safe, however, after several months of kind of cleaning, some items started to form rust on the outer edges, which is a big minus. I would recommend washing them by hand.\nWhen it comes to the items, ChefLand\u2019s set includes a roasting pan, a round pizza pan, a large and medium cookie sheet, two round cake pans, a square cake pan, a loaf pan, an oven crisper pan, and a 12-cup muffin pan. As far as I\u2019m concerned this set has everything covered!\nMost of the dishes have handles on them, and even those which don't, have a nice grip area that allows for good handling.\nUnfortunately, there is no silicon padding or protective surface so you will need to use gloves or cloth.\nThis bakeware set comes to us from Sunbeam; it is a bit smaller set in terms of the number of items in it, but a worthy addition to today's list. Oh, I forgot to mention it\u2019s cheap as chips!\nThe material these pans are made of is carbon steel, and its non-stick features are achieved with a xylan coating interior and exterior. The black color gives it a pretty plain, non-exciting look, but I personally do not mind this.\nThe Sunbeam set has only 5-pieces, which is significantly less than other sets we reviewed today. The dishes included are a loaf pan, a cookie sheet, a 6-cup muffin pan, and two round cake pans.\nOne disadvantage of this set is that it cannot handle temperatures higher than 400 F, which is quite limiting because some recipes require more heat.\nAll of the pans have handles or enough room to grab them properly and handle safely.\nNow as I was reading some online commentary, many people complained that pans arrived dented or bent when they ordered them, so this might be an issue.\nI haven\u2019t experienced this myself, so I just want to put it out as a warning.\nThis set differs from others I reviewed today because it is the only one that\u2019s not made of metal.\nBoxiki Kitchen brings us this 3-piece silicone set that bread and cake lovers might find interesting.\nAs I\u2019ve said, these products are made of silicone which has its pros and cons.\nThe good thing is that food will just slide out of it, but it might be irritating when trying to wash it by hand because it\u2019s so bendy. A lot of people raise concerns about chemicals in this material, so you\u2019ll be glad to know that this set is FDA approved and non-toxic.\nThe set comes with three items \u2013 a round cake pan, a square brownie pan, and a banana bread/meatloaf pan.\nAll of the dishes are equipped with metal handles which allows for a nice and solid grip, so you won\u2019t have to worry about the pans slipping out of your hands.\nSilicone is generally oven safe up to 500 degrees F, which is fantastic and much better than some metal products, so you won\u2019t need to worry about burning your bakeware.\nHowever, the metal handles don't seem to take high temperatures very well, and I've heard some reports of them flaking and bubbling at 400 F.\nI hope that the article was helpful and that it got you acquainted with the basics of bakeware.\nNow, the time has come for me to declare my top pick of the day, and the product that got most of my sympathies is Rachel Ray\u2019s 10-piece Cucina Set.\nIts beautiful design is what attracted me to this bakeware set, but the excellent performance made an even stronger impression.\nNon-stick surface does its job flawlessly, and the carbon steel construction is sturdy and strong.\nThis is a very good list, i have tested myself the Rachel Ray\u2019s 10-Piece Cucina Bakeware Set and i\u2019m satisfied with it, it fulfill most of my daily cooking.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T02:37:15Z", "url": "https://kitchenbyte.com/best-bakeware-sets/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Are film trailers spoiling movies?\nIn April we asked if high ticket prices were ruining your visits to the cinema. Yes, you said overwhelmingly. But something else has put a strain on my relationship with the cinema \u2013 and it\u2019s not the popcorn.\nHave you ever gone to your local cinema to watch a new film only to feel you\u2019ve seen it before? I know I have. \u2018Spoilerific\u2019 film trailers are now often so detailed it seems hardly worth watching the movie itself.\nImagine if the trailer for Casablanca told you whether Ingrid Bergman went off with Humphrey Bogart or Paul Henreid at the end. Or if the trailer for Citizen Kane revealed just what the dying man meant when he muttered the word \u2018Rosebud\u2019.\nAnd it seems that even some film directors agree. Colin Trevorrow, director of new film, Jurassic World, has said he think that trailers have shown far more of the film than he would have wanted.\nIn the last couple of months, I\u2019ve paid \u00a317.50 a ticket to see two films I\u2019ve been anticipating for some time. OK \u00a317.50 sounds steep, but that was for iMAX 3D and I\u2019d still have paid more than \u00a310 for a \u2018normal\u2019 ticket.\nBut I left the cinema unfulfilled, because I felt like I\u2019d seen them both six months before.\nIn both cases the trailer revealed the entire structure of the story, key plot twists and expensive action sequences. Throw in a few character deaths for good measure and you\u2019ve got the basis of a significant chunk of what you\u2019ve paid your money for.\nI really did feel cheated by what the studio had wanted me to see in advance.\nSo is this just a modern trend? I checked out trailers for 1981\u2019s Raiders of the Lost Ark, and 1964\u2019s Goldfinger to get a bigger picture.\nBoth revealed some well-known scenes (including Goldfinger\u2019s iconic laser and dialogue), but the plot basics were instead explained by voiceover, rather than any especially huge visual giveaways.\nBesides, the chance of actually seeing these trailers was significantly lessened due to the technology available at the time of release. Which got me thinking further.\n\u2018If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t watch it\u2019, I hear you cry. I wish it were that simple. In the age of the internet, exposure has increased tenfold.\nMarketing campaigns target social media and television, while the days of a simple poster are gone. Why commission a still image when you can display scenes from the film on a screen in a station or other public place?\nNot only that, but trailers are also forced upon you in the cinema itself before other films. Without a blindfold and a soundproof booth to hide in you have little choice.\nIt\u2019s not that I have a problem with marketing and ads. But they\u2019re spoiling the experience. I don\u2019t want to see all the best bits wrapped up into two minutes, six months ahead of release.\nHave you had a film spoiled by its trailer/marketing? Is Hollywood revealing too much in a desperate attempt to put bums on seats?\nDo ticket prices ruin your film-going experience?\nSomething George mentioned earlier about Terminator 2 trailer jogged my memory about another film from the same franchise, Terminator Genisys.\nTo promote the film, a trailer had been released that included a major plot twist ACTUALLY in the trailer. Now, I had heard about this trailer and had been purposely avoiding it. However, even when you try to avoid spoilers, sometimes it\u2019s out of your control. When I went to see Mad Max, they showed the afore-mentioned trailer and before I realised, it was too late. It cannot be unseen.\nEven the director, Alan Taylor, was unhappy about the spoilers in the trailer.\nGenisys was [spoiler alert] \u2026.. indeed half of the inspiration for this convo. I saw that article about Alan Taylor\u2019s thoughts the other day, but could only sympathise so much as the film was, in my opinion, a travesty.\nHave you seen the film now Ryan?

{"text": "UNStudio has joined forces with HPP Architects to create a consortium (UNS + HPP) to carry out the next phases of their winning project at the architectural design competition for FOUR Frankfurt. Take a look at the complete story after the jump.\nFrom the architects: The centrally located 16,000 square meter site was purchased by Gro\u00df & Partner real estate development company \u2013 who will be carrying out the development of the project \u2013 back in 2015. Situated in the very core of the city, the site has been completely inaccessible for the last 45 years. Now four new high-rise towers will change Frankfurt\u2019s skyline from the air, while cultivating its liveliness on the ground. The development of these towers, reaching heights of 228 meters, will open up new streets to create a multi-use, vibrant inner-city quarter, bringing together a healthy mix of work, living, relaxation and recreation.\nThe choice of programmes allows for a smooth transition from Frankfurt\u2019s shopping district to the east of Ro\u00dfmarkt, to the high-rise office towers clustered around Park Taunusanlage. With a development concept that is unique to Europe, the FOUR Frankfurt project brings together facilities that will establish a lively new neighbourhood for Frankfurt, its visitors, and its (future) residents.\nThe new high-rise complex will be integrated into the expanding city structure by incorporating the heritage-listed facades of the Junghofstra\u00dfe into the design and by making a multi-storey base building the connecting element of the entire site.\nAccording to the assessment by the competition jury, the unique quality of the quarter can be found in its public development and amenity value. The new development will therefore create connected spaces, accessible rooftops, pathways and passages. The existing block on the Junghofstra\u00dfe will be opened up to strengthen the surrounding pathways and ensure a high level of accessibility. This will create a multi-use, diverse quarter comprising 50% office spaces, 30% living accommodation (including subsidized housing), in addition to retail spaces, restaurants and hotels.\nFour Frankfurt is expected to be completed in 2023.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T12:20:23Z", "url": "https://www.archiscene.net/tower/four-frankfurt-unstudio/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The rally was also held in the last year with the same objectives. Goals of the rally are to criticize Jogye Order for its responsibility on Dongguk University\u2019s present conflicts related to President Han Tae-sik (Bogwang) and to guarantee the school\u2019s autonomy from the order.\nAt 11:00 A.M., approximately 200 people, about 150 Donggukians and 50 people who are related to Dongguk University, gathered together in Manhae Hall. As soon as the march began, the marchers were obstructed by police officers because of a cow, which was prepared by the GSC, was not reported to participate in the rally. Scuffles broke out between the police and the GSC, and the cow was not able to go with the marchers. The parade was started from Chungmu-ro where Dongguk University is located, passed Myeong-dong and finally to Jogyesa Temple.\nAfter several speeches from students, the GSC and the gathered students tried to deliver request proposal to Jogye Order together, but police officers blocked the way. Therefore, only ten representatives were allowed to go to deliver the request proposal to the persons concerned of the Jogye Order at the temple gate. The request proposal involves following three demands: Jogye Order has to stop intervening in the school matters and should guarantee the school\u2019s autonomy, every sunim who spoiled the school needs to apologize and resign, and board of directors should be reformed in a more democratic way.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T14:15:51Z", "url": "http://www.dgupost.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1902", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Quartz is one of the most common and varied minerals on earth, and its abundant colors produce many gemstone types. Amethyst and Citrine are the most popular and valuable gem varieties of Quartz, but other forms also make important gemstones. Chalcedony describes any form of Quartz that is microcrystalline, in compact form without any visible crystals. Chalcedony also has several varieties used as gemstones, most notably Agate, Carnelian, Tiger's Eye, and Chrysoprase.\nPure Quartz, which is also known as Rock Crystal, is colorless. Various impurities are responsible for the extensive range of colors. The main crystalline Quartz varieties used as gemstones are described below.\nAmethyst, the purple variety, is the most popular and valuable Quartz gemstone. Amethyst ranges from light to dark purple. See the Amethyst gemstone page for more details.\nCitrine is the yellow, orange, or reddish-brown variety of Quartz. It is usually colored by heat treatment of Amethyst or Smoky Quartz. Light yellow or lemon yellow Citrine is often called Lemon Quartz in the gem trade. See the Citrine gemstone page for more details.\nSmoky Quartz is the brown \"smoky\" variety of Quartz. It ranges in color from light brown to black. Despite its dark color, it is rarely opaque. See the Smoky Quartz gemstone page for more details.\nThe rosy pink variety of Quartz is known as Rose Quartz, and its color is usually soft, ranging from very light pink to medium pink in intensity. Rose Quartz is often milky or hazy, and it may lack good transparency. See the Rose Quartz gemstone page for more details.\nThe colorless, transparent variety of Quartz, free of any impurities, is known as \"Rock Crystal\". Flawless and very large cuts may be cut from Rock Crystal.\nMilky Quartz is the white, translucent to opaque variety of Quartz. Though very common in nature, it is not used as a gemstone.\nColorless Quartz with golden yellow Rutile inclusions, as hairlike growths within the gemstone, are known as Rutilated Quartz. See the Rutilated Quartz gemstone page for more details.\nAmetrine is an interesting, color-zoned combination of purple Amethyst and brownish-yellow Citrine. See the Ametrine gemstone page for more details.\nPrasiolite, or Green Quartz, describes a light green Quartz artificially colored by heat treatment of certain types of Amethyst. May also be called \"Green Amethyst\" by some jewelers.\nThe blue variety of Quartz, which is uncommon in nature, is seldom used as a gemstone. Most \"Blue Quartz\" is clear Rock Crystal irradiated with gold to from a deep sky blue color. Blue Quartz may also refer to a dull grayish-blue Quartz in massive form with Crocidolite inclusions.\nColorless Quartz with Tourmaline inclusions, often as thin long black crystals, is known as \"Tourmalinated Quartz\".\nCat's Eye Quartz is Quartz with dense, tiny Rutile inclusions that cause a cat's eye effect. It is not common, and the chatoyant effect is usually weak. Cat's Eye Quartz is usually grayish in color and translucent.\nAll forms of Quartz are used as gemstones, and they are all affordable. They are cut into various gemstone cuts and cabochons, and used in all forms of jewelry. Lesser quality stones are often tumbled for use in bracelets, necklaces, and as costume jewelery. Large spheres and carvings are also cut from all the Quartz forms. Due to its abundance and lack of luster, Rock Crystal is not commonly cut into gemstones, although some very large spheres and sculptures are carved from it. Small crystals of Rock Crystal are sometime worn as pendants, sometimes being polished and smoothed, and sometimes in their entirely natural crystal form.\nVarieties specific to Amethyst, Citrine, Smoky Quartz, Rose Quartz, Rutilated Quartz, and Chalcedony are listed separately.\nAmethyst\t- Purple variety of Quartz, and its most popular and valuable gemstone variety. (See the Amethyst gemstone page for more details.) Tumbled Amethyst with white Milky Quartz is sometimes known as Amethyst Quartz.\nAventurine\t- Opaque, compact Quartz / Chalcedony containing small Mica, Hematite, or Goethite scales which cause a glistening effect. Aventurine is most often green but may also be other colors such as gray, orange, and brown.\nBlue Quartz - Rare natural blue variety of Quartz. It is caused by inclusions of blue minerals, especially Dumortierite. Most \"Blue Quartz\" is what is popularly known as \"Aqua Aura\", essentially clear Rock Crystal synthetically irradiated with gold to form a deep sky blue color. Blue Quartz may also refer to a dull grayish-blue Quartz in massive form with Crocidolite inclusions.\nCat's Eye Quartz - Quartz with dense, tiny Rutile inclusions that cause a cat's eye effect. Cat's Eye Quartz is not common, and the chatoyant effect is usually weak. Cat's Eye Quartz is usually grayish in color and translucent.\nLemon Quartz - Lemon Quartz is a light to dark yellow Citrine, distinguished from most Citrine by lacking orange, brown, or reddish tints. More often though it is clear Quartz that is irradiated to produce an intensely colored yellow gemstone. Lemon Quartz has recently experienced a popularity increase in the gemstone market.\nMilky Quartz - White, translucent to opaque variety of Quartz. It is not commonly used as a gemstone.\nPrase - Light to emerald green, transparent to translucent Quartz / Chalcedony, with coloring caused from inclusions of green minerals, such as Actinolite, Hedenbergite, Chlorite, or Malachite.\nPrasiolite - Light green gem form Quartz artificially colored by heat treatment of certain types of Amethyst. May also be called Green Amethyst by some jewelers.\nRock Crystal - The colorless, transparent variety of Quartz, free of impurities is called \"Rock Crystal\".\nTourmalinated Quartz - Quartz with splintery Tourmaline inclusions.\nAmethyst may be heat treated to deepen the purple color. Most gem Citrine is produced by heat treating Amethyst, and the green Quartz known as Prasiolite or \"Green Amethyst\" is also produced by heating Amethyst from specific localities.\nCertain colorful Quartz types not found in nature are produced through irradiation. Some forms of Quartz with a multicolored rainbow effect are synthetically treated to produce their color effect using film deposition. The process involves bonding an extremely thin metallic film layer over the top of the gemstone, so that the interesting color effects are reflected from the crown. Some vividly colorful forms of Quartz are synthetic grown using the hydrothermal method.\nQuartz is extremely common and is found in numerous localities throughout the world. The important sources are far too numerous to mention, though in general the most prolific countries that produce Quartz gemstones are Brazil, Madagascar, India, and the U.S. (Arkansas). Specific sources for the popular Quartz varieties are described on their dedicated pages.\nSee the individual variety pages for specific variety similarities.\nRock crystal is similar to glass, but the softness of glass usually lends it to scratches and soft etches which are lacking on Rock Crystal. Rock Crystal is rarely cut into small facets, so it usually is not a concern of confusion to other colorless gems such as Diamond, White Topaz, and White Sapphire. These white gemstones will also have a greater dispersion and exhibit more fire.\nAdditional images for the varieties Amethyst, Citrine, Smoky Quartz, Rose Quartz, Rutilated Quartz, and Chalcedony are listed separately.\nHave a question about Quartz?

The Chinese company\u2019s official port of PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds (PUBG) is now available on iOS and Android worldwide.\nWe tried PUBG on iPhone X when it released in China last month and came away very impressed. It successfully squeezed much of the PC and Xbox game down to a much smaller screen -- and in places looked even better than the Xbox One version of the game.\nIt comes a week after rival Fortnite began inviting players to test its own mobile version. Unlike PUBG, Fortnite will allow players to play across platforms -- meaning iPhone players can kill or be killed by gamers on PC or PlayStation 4.\nFortnite recently surpassed pioneer PUBG in popularity. Both games feature 100 players landing on a deserted island filled with weapons, with everyone fighting to be the last person left standing. While PUBG adopts a realistic setting, Fortnite has a more cartoon-like look -- and an emphasis on building structures sets it apart from its rival.\nBut Tencent may find its main competition for PUBG on mobile could come from other Chinese companies.

Since last June, they\u2019ve been arranging for professional and corporate volunteers to dedicate some of their time to helping Thames Reach clients at iReach, a weekly digital skills workshop at our Employment Academy in Camberwell.\niReach gives people with little or no computer skills the opportunity to learn at their own pace.

But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year\u2019s NFL Draft. He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round.

If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T10:16:10Z", "url": "https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/sports/college/iowa-state/cyclone-insider/2019/03/01/nfl-scouting-combine-hakeem-butler-iowa-state-cyclones-indianapolis-david-montgomery-wide-receiver/3034514002/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Building a successful software platform is done by building software with a purpose by solving a problem that people already have. The problem may not be obvious, and it may not even be a problem that people are aware of, but the problem exists. Using Instagram as a case study, I think there are four keys a platforms success.\nMost people aren't professional photographers. They don't have access to the tools professional photographers use nor the time or money to buy the tools and learn them. But they do want professional looking photos. Instagram built a platform that had intrinsic value on it's own by providing people the ability to easily create professional looking photographs.\nOne of the keys that made Instagram successful was that they took something people were already doing and made it easier and better. They removed the need to download photos from a mobile device and then upload them from a desktop or laptop. They simplified the process and allowed users to share exiting photos right from their phones or take a new photo to share.\nThey also simplified an otherwise complex photo editing process by providing a set of templates that people could apply without having to understand image editing. This enabled a regular person to have professional looking photos without any work.\nOne thing that Instagram did very well is that it built it's software to work with exiting services like Facebook and Twitter. Services that already had a huge community of users. They didn't try to re-create Twitter or Facebook. Instead, they allowed Twitter and Facebook to get better by making their service interoperable.\nInstagram didn't force people to ONLY use their service. Instead, it allowed people to continue to use their existing social media services and augment a specific workflow to be better if they wanted to. Users don't want to be asked to chose between this OR that. They want to be able to use this AND that. Will your software provide additional choices or limit choices?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T14:48:54Z", "url": "http://paul.oremland.net/2016/01/building-successful-software-platform.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Meaningful, reliable and valid mRNA expression analyses by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) can only be achieved, if suitable reference genes are chosen for normalization and if appropriate RT-qPCR quality standards are met. Human periodontal ligament (hPDL) fibroblasts play a major mediating role in orthodontic tooth movement and periodontitis. Despite corresponding in-vitro gene expression studies being a focus of interest for many years, no information is available for hPDL fibroblasts on suitable reference genes, which are generally used in RT-qPCR experiments to normalize variability between samples. The aim of this study was to identify and validate suitable reference genes for normalization in untreated hPDL fibroblasts as well as experiments on orthodontic tooth movement or periodontitis (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). We investigated the suitability of 13 candidate reference genes using four different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, comparative Delta C-q and BestKeeper) and ranked them according to their expression stability. Overall PPIB (peptidylprolyl isomerase A), TBP (TATA-box-binding protein) and RPL22 (ribosomal protein 22) were found to be most stably expressed with two genes in conjunction sufficient for reliable normalization. This study provides an accurate tool for quantitative gene expression analysis in hPDL fibroblasts according to the MIQE guidelines and shows that reference gene reliability is treatment-specific.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T14:24:09Z", "url": "https://epub.uni-regensburg.de/36212/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Grace. What is it? What does it mean? How do you get it and how do you KNOW you got it?\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know the answers to these questions. I have no way of describing something I don\u2019t understand BUT believe deeply in my soul that it exists. How do you get these graces? Sanctifying grace is IN your soul. It\u2019s the free and underserved gift from God. Actual grace would come from our knowledge and belief of all things right and wrong \u2013 following the Ten Commandments, making sure we follow a path that is pure and justified. Justified means to be sinless, and to be sinless means you are in favor with God. When you are baptized you are sinless and therefore have favor with God. When you go to reconciliation, you are once again sinless and in favor with God. You are in a state of grace. Once sanctifying grace is in your soul, you can increase it by every good action you do \u2013 receiving Communion, saying prayers, performing corporal works of Mercy. The most important thing to think about is NOT what you are going to do or how you are going to do it but to recognize God\u2019s love. The reason you can do any good work is because God LOVES YOU FIRST in Grace. You must continually seek God\u2019s grace, continually respond to the actual graces God is working within you, inclining you to turn to Him and do good.\nHave I answered the question as to what Grace is? I\u2019ve read through all the study guides provided to me and compiled all the information, but I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve properly explained what Grace is.\nTo me Grace is a feeling. Sometimes it\u2019s butterflies in the stomach, and it takes my breath away. I feel this way every time I think of my husband. We met and married 38 years ago. I see God\u2019s grace in our meeting, getting married, and living our life together as husband and wife. Sometimes it\u2019s a jolt, like an electric shock and then an overwhelming wave of love, like the enormous amount of love I felt when I held my first baby in my arms for the first time. This happened again with my 2nd and 3rd child, and then God blessed us with twins to make 4 and 5. Then sometimes it feels like a raging fight going on inside me, making hard decisions that breaks my heart in two. I have no power to stop things from happening and my only recourse is just to constantly pray. Mostly it\u2019s a feeling of ultimate peace and an over-whelming calmness that comes over me at different times during the day when God allows me glimpses of HIS love for me: when my dog and cat are doing something cute together; when I see the birds eating the seed I put out for them; when a certain little girl comes over to the house and calls me \u201cGrandma\u201d. I just breathe a sigh of thanksgiving and relax in the comfort of His hand.\nWhere does Grace come from?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T12:25:43Z", "url": "https://stmarysdsm.org/ministry/gof/how-to-recognize-grace/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Everyone seems to want a brighter smile, and teeth whitening is a great option for boosting your confidence. If food and drinks have stained your pearly whites, you may be tempted to rush to the drug store and pick up the first over-the-counter whitening product you find. However, while side effects from whitening products are rare, you should follow these tips before bleaching your teeth to ensure your safety.\nIf your teeth appear stained, don\u2019t assume you need to bleach them. It\u2019s possible a good teeth cleaning will restore the sparkle to your smile. During an oral exam, your dentist will also check for cavities and gum issues, which should be treated before bleaching your teeth.\nAt-home whiteners most often use carbamide peroxide in concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 percent. Carbamide peroxide is hydrogen peroxide with urea added. This product remains active for up to 10 hours at a low enough acidity level that enamel etching is not a concern.\nStart with a product containing 10 percent carbamide peroxide. If the whitener doesn\u2019t bother your mouth, but you don\u2019t see the results you want, try another over-the-counter product with a higher concentration.\nWhen you choose an at-home teeth bleaching kit, it\u2019s your responsibility to follow the instructions on the package. Don\u2019t leave the gel or strips on your teeth longer than advised or you could experience tooth sensitivity and sore gums. Also, avoid drinking soda, sports drinks or other sugary/acidic beverages for several hours after whitening to prevent etching your teeth.\nAt-home whitening kits are inexpensive and widely available, but that doesn\u2019t make them the best choice. Professional in-office teeth bleaching can lighten your smile up to eight shades in a single 45-minute visit. Combined with professional-grade take-home treatments, patients see an average improvement of 11 shades. In comparison, over-the-counter whitening requires daily 30-minute applications for more than two weeks to achieve a six-shade improvement.\nIn-office whitening uses LED light-activated technology to maximize results in the shortest amount of time without causing tooth sensitivity. It\u2019s effective both for people who simply want to lighten their smile and for patients with severely discolored teeth.\nPregnant women and nursing mothers should postpone teeth bleaching.\nTranslucent teeth don\u2019t respond well to whitening. A tooth-colored composite placed on the lingual side of a see-through tooth is a more effective way to improve its appearance.\nZen Dental Center in Seattle offers Philips Zoom in-office teeth bleaching for safe, professional results.

{"text": "Yesterday [12 Nov], at the Shoreditch Town Hall, Dr. Macdonald, M.P., the coroner for the North- Eastern District of Middlesex, opened his inquiry relative to the death of Marie Jeanette Kelly, the woman whose body was discovered on Friday morning, terribly mutilated, in a room on the ground floor of 26, Dorset-street, entrance to which was by a side door in Miller's-court.\nSuperintendent T. Arnold, H Division; Inspector Abberline, of the Criminal Investigation Department, and Inspector Nairn represented the police. The deputy coroner, Mr. Hodgkinson, was present during the proceedings.\nThe Coroner (to the juror, severely): Do you think that we do not know what we are doing here, and that we do not know our own district? The jury are summoned in the ordinary way, and they have no business to object. If they persist in their objection I shall know how to deal with them. Does any juror persist in objecting ?\nThe Juror: We are summoned for the Shoreditch district. This affair happened in Spitalfields. The Coroner: It happened within my district.\nThe jury having made no further objection, they were duly sworn, and were conducted by Inspector Abberline to view the body, which, decently coffined, was at the mortuary adjoining Shoreditch Church, and subsequently the jury inspected the room, in Miller's-court, Dorset- street, where the murder was committed. The apartment, a plan of which was given in yesterday's Daily Telegraph, is poorly furnished, and uncarpeted. The position of the two tables was not altered. One of them was placed near the bed, behind the door, and the other next to the largest of the two windows which look upon the yard in which the dustbin and water-tap are situated.\nJoseph Barnett deposed : I was a fish-porter, and I work as a labourer and fruit- porter. Until Saturday last I lived at 24, New-street, Bishopsgate, and have since stayed at my sister's, 21, Portpool-lane, Gray's Inn-road. I have lived with the deceased one year and eight months. Her name was Marie Jeanette Kelly with the French spelling as described to me. Kelly was her maiden name. I have seen the body, and I identify it by the ear and eyes, which are all that I can recognise; but I am positive it is the same woman I knew. I lived with her in No. 13 room, at Miller's-court for eight months. I separated from her on Oct. 30.\n[Coroner] Why did you leave her ? - Because she had a woman of bad character there, whom she took in out of compassion, and I objected to it. That was the only reason. I left her on the Tuesday between five and six p.m. I last saw her alive between half-past seven and a quarter to eight on Thursday night last, when I called upon her. I stayed there for a quarter of an hour.\n[Coroner] Were you on good terms ? - Yes, on friendly terms; but when we parted I told her I had no work, and had nothing to give her, for which I was very sorry.\n[Coroner] Did you drink together ? - No, sir. She was quite sober.\n[Coroner] Was she, generally speaking, of sober habits ? - When she was with me I found her of sober habits, but she has been drunk several times in my presence.\n[Coroner] Was there any one else there on the Thursday evening ? - Yes, a woman who lives in the court. She left first, and I followed shortly afterwards.\n[Coroner] Have you had conversation with deceased about her parents ? - Yes, frequently. She said she was born in Limerick, and went when very young to Wales. She did not say how long she lived there, but that she came to London about four years ago. Her father's name was John Kelly, a \"gaffer\" or foreman in an iron works in Carnarvonshire, or Carmarthen. She said she had one sister, who was respectable, who travelled from market place to market place. This sister was very fond of her. There were six brothers living in London, and one was in the army. One of them was named Henry. I never saw the brothers to my knowledge. She said she was married when very young in Wales to a collier. I think the name was Davis or Davies. She said she had lived with him until he was killed in an explosion, but I cannot say how many years since that was. Her age was, I believe, 16 when she married. After her husband's death deceased went to Cardiff to a cousin.\n[Coroner] Did she live there long ? - Yes, she was in an infirmary there for eight or nine months. She was following a bad life with her cousin, who, as I reckon, and as I often told her, was the cause of her downfall.\n[Coroner] After she left Cardiff did she come direct to London ? - Yes. She was in a gay house in the West-end, but in what part she did not say. A gentleman came there to her and asked her if she would like to go to France.\n[Coroner] Did she go to France ? - Yes; but she did not remain long. She said she did not like the part, but whether it was the part or purpose I cannot say. She was not there more than a fortnight, and she returned to England, and went to Ratcliffe-highway. She must have lived there for some time. Afterwards she lived with a man opposite the Commercial Gas Works, Stepney. The man's name was Morganstone.\n[Coroner] Have you seen that man ? - Never. I don't know how long she lived with him.\n[Coroner] Was Morganstone the last man she lived with ? - I cannot answer that question, but she described a man named Joseph Fleming, who came to Pennington-street, a bad house, where she stayed. I don't know when this was. She was very fond of him. He was a mason's plasterer, and lodged in the Bethnal-green-road.\n[Coroner] Was that all you knew of her history when you lived with her? - Yes. After she lived with Morganstone or Fleming - I don't know which one was the last - she lived with me.\n[Coroner] Where did you pick up with her first ? - In Commercial-street. We then had a drink together, and I made arrangements to see her on the following day - a Saturday. On that day we both of us agreed that we should remain together. I took lodgings in George-street, Commercial-street, where I was known. I lived with her, until I left her, on very friendly terms.\n[Coroner] Did she express fear of any particular individual ? - No, sir. Our own quarrels were very soon over.\nThomas Bowyer stated: I live at 37, Dorset-street, and am employed by Mr. McCarthy. I serve in his chandler's shop, 27, Dorset-street. At a quarter to eleven a.m., on Friday morning, I was ordered by McCarthy to go to Mary Jane's room, No. 13. I did not know the deceased by the name of Kelly. I went for rent, which was in arrears. Knocking at the door, I got no answer, and I knocked again and again. Receiving no reply, I passed round the corner by the gutter spout where there is a broken window - it is the smallest window.\nCharles Ledger, an inspector of police, G Division, produced a plan of the premises. Bowyer pointed out the window, which was the one nearest the entrance.\nHe [Bowyer] continued: There was a curtain. I put my hand through the broken pane and lifted the curtain. I saw two pieces of flesh lying on the table.\n[Coroner] Where was this table ? - In front of the bed, close to it. The second time I looked I saw a body on this bed, and blood on the floor. I at once went very quietly to Mr. McCarthy. We then stood in the shop, and I told him what I had seen. We both went to the police-station, but first of all we went to the window, and McCarthy looked in to satisfy himself. We told the inspector at the police-station of what we had seen. Nobody else knew of the matter. The inspector returned with us.\n[Coroner] Did you see the deceased constantly ? - I have often seen her. I knew the last witness, Barnett. I have seen the deceased drunk once.\nJohn McCarthy, grocer and lodging-house keeper, testified: I live at 27, Dorset- street. On Friday morning, about a quarter to eleven, I sent my man Bowyer to Room 13 to call for rent. He came back in five minutes, saying, \"Guv'nor, I knocked at the door, and could not make any one answer; I looked through the window and saw a lot of blood.\" I accompanied him, and looked through the window myself, saw the blood and the woman. For a moment I could not say anything, and I then said: \"You had better fetch the police.\" I knew the deceased as Mary Jane Kelly, and had no doubt at all about her identity. I followed Bowyer to Commercial-street Police-station, where I saw Inspector Beck. I inquired at first for Inspector Reid. Inspector Beck returned with me at once.\n[Coroner] How long had the deceased lived in the room ? - Ten months. She lived with Barnett. I did not know whether they were married or not; they lived comfortably together, but they had a row when the window was broken. The bedstead, bed-clothes, table, and every article of furniture belonged to me.\n[Coroner] What rent was paid for this room ? - It was supposed to be 4s 6d a week. Deceased was in arrears 29s. I was to be paid the rent weekly. Arrears are got as best you can. I frequently saw the deceased the worse for drink. When sober she was an exceptionally quiet woman, but when in drink she had more to say. She was able to walk about, and was not helpless.\n[Coroner] Where was this ? - In Dorset-street. She went up the court, a few steps in front of me.\n[Coroner] Was anybody with her ? - A short, stout man, shabbily dressed. He had on a longish coat, very shabby, and carried a pot of ale in his hand.\n[Coroner] What was the colour of the coat ? - A dark coat.\n[Coroner] What hat had he ? - A round hard billycock.\n[Coroner] Long or short hair ? - I did not notice. He had a blotchy face, and full carrotty moustache.\n[Coroner] The chin was shaven ? - Yes. A lamp faced the door.\n[Coroner] Did you see them go into her room ? - Yes; I said \"Good night, Mary,\" and she turned round and banged the door.\n[Coroner] Had he anything in his hands but the can ? - No.\n[Coroner] Did she say anything ? - She said \"Good night, I am going to have a song.\" As I went in she sang \"A violet I plucked from my mother's grave when a boy.\" I remained a quarter of an hour in my room and went out. Deceased was still singing at one o'clock when I returned. I remained in the room for a minute to warm my hands as it was raining, and went out again. She was singing still, and I returned to my room at three o'clock. The light was then out and there was no noise.\n[Coroner] Did you go to sleep ? - No; I was upset. I did not undress at all. I did not sleep at all. I must have heard what went on in the court. I heard no noise or cry of \"Murder,\" but men went out to work in the market.\n[Coroner] How many men live in the court who work in Spitalfields Market ? - One. At a quarter- past six I heard a man go down the court. That was too late for the market.\n[Coroner] From what house did he go ? - I don't know.\n[Coroner] Did you hear the door bang after him ? - No.\n[Coroner] Then he must have walked up the court and back again? - Yes.\n[Coroner] It might have been a policeman ? - It might have been.\n[Coroner] What would you take the stout man's age to be ? - Six-and-thirty.\n[Coroner] Did you notice the colour of his trousers ? - All his clothes were dark.\n[Coroner] Did his boots sound as if the heels were heavy ? - There was no sound as he went up the court.\n[Coroner] Then you think that his boots were down at heels ? - He made no noise.\n[Coroner] What clothes had Mary Jane on ? - She had no hat; a red pelerine and a shabby skirt.\n[Coroner] You say she was drunk ? - I did not notice she was drunk until she said good night. The man closed the door. By the Jury: There was a light in the window, but I saw nothing, as the blinds were down. I should know the man again, if I saw him.\n[Coroner] Do you often hear cries of \"Murder?\" - It is nothing unusual in the street. I did not take particular notice.\n[Coroner] Did you hear it a second time? - No.\n[Coroner] Did you hear beds or tables being pulled about? - None whatever. I went asleep, and was awake again at five a.m. I passed down the stairs, and saw some men harnessing horses. At a quarter to six I was in the Ten Bells.\n[Coroner] Could the witness, Mary Ann Cox, have come down the entry between one and half-past one o'clock without your knowledge ? - Yes, she could have done so.\n[Coroner] Did you see any strangers at the Ten Bells ? - No. I went back to bed and slept until eleven.\n[Coroner] You heard no singing downstairs ? - None whatever. I should have heard the singing distinctly. It was quite quiet at half-past one o'clock.\nCaroline Maxewell, 14, Dorset-street, said: My husband is a lodging-house deputy. I knew the deceased for about four months. I believe she was an unfortunate. On two occasions I spoke to her.\n[Coroner] Did you speak to her ? - Yes; it was an unusual thing to see her up. She was a young woman who never associated with any one. I spoke across the street, \"What, Mary, brings you up so early ?\" She said, \"Oh, Carrie, I do feel so bad.\"\n[Coroner] And yet you say you had only spoken to her twice previously; you knew her name and she knew yours ? - Oh, yes; by being about in the lodging-house.\n[Coroner] What did she say ? - She said, \"I've had a glass of beer, and I've brought it up again\"; and it was in the road. I imagined she had been in the Britannia beer-shop at the corner of the street. I left her, saying that I could pity her feelings. I went to Bishopsgate-street to get my husband's breakfast. Returning I saw her outside the Britannia public-house, talking to a man.\n[Coroner] This would be about what time ? - Between eight and nine o'clock. I was absent about half-an-hour. It was about a quarter to nine.\n[Coroner] What description can you give of this man ? - I could not give you any, as they were at some distance.\n[Coroner] What sort of dress had the deceased ? - A dark skirt, a velvet body, a maroon shawl, and no hat.\n[Coroner] Have you ever seen her the worse for drink ? - I have seen her in drink, but she was not a notorious character.\nSarah Lewis deposed: I live at 24, Great Pearl-street, and am a laundress. I know Mrs. Keyler, in Miller's-court, and went to her house at 2, Miller's-court, at 2.30a.m. on Friday. It is the first house. I noticed the time by the Spitalfields' Church clock. When I went into the court, opposite the lodging-house I saw a man with a wideawake. There was no one talking to him. He was a stout-looking man, and not very tall. The hat was black. I did not take any notice of his clothes. The man was looking up the court; he seemed to be waiting or looking for some one. Further on there was a man and woman - the later being in drink. There was nobody in the court. I dozed in a chair at Mrs. Keyler's, and woke at about half- past three. I heard the clock strike.\n[Coroner] What woke you up ? - I could not sleep. I sat awake until nearly four, when I heard a female's voice shouting \"Murder\" loudly. It seemed like the voice of a young woman. It sounded at our door. There was only one scream.\n[Coroner] Were you afraid ? Did you wake anybody up ? - No, I took no notice, as I only heard the one scream.\n[Coroner] You stayed at Keyler's house until what time ? - Half-past five p.m. on Friday. The police would not let us out of the court.\n[Coroner] Have you seen any suspicious persons in the district ? - On Wednesday night I was going along the Bethnal-green-road, with a woman, about eight o'clock, when a gentleman passed us. He followed us and spoke to us, and wanted us to follow him into an entry. He had a shiny leather bag with him.\n[Coroner] Did he want both of you ? - No; only one. I refused. He went away and came back again, saying he would treat us. He put down his bag and picked it up again, saying, \"What are you frightened about ? Do you think I've got anything in the bag ?\" We then ran away, as we were frightened.\n[Coroner] Was he a tall man ? - He was short, pale-faced, with a black moustache, rather small. His age was about forty.\n[Coroner] Was it a large bag ? - No, about 6in to 9in long. His hat was a high round hat. He had a brownish overcoat, with a black short coat underneath. His trousers were a dark pepper-and- salt.\n[Coroner] After he left you what did you do ? - We ran away.\n[Coroner] Have you seen him since ? - On Friday morning, about half-past two a.m., when I was going to Miller's-court, I met the same man with a woman in Commercial-street, near Mr. Ringer's public-house (the Britannia). He had no overcoat on.\n[Coroner] Had he the black bag ? - Yes.\n[Coroner] Were the man and woman quarrelling ? - No; they were talking. As I passed he looked at me. I don't know whether he recognised me. There was no policeman about.\nMr. George Bagster Phillips, divisional surgeon of police, said: I was called by the police on Friday morning at eleven o'clock, and on proceeding to Miller's-court, which I entered at 11.15, I found a room, the door of which led out of the passage at the side of 26, Dorset-street, photographs of which I produce. It had two windows in the court. Two panes in the lesser window were broken, and as the door was locked I looked through the lower of the broken panes and satisfied myself that the mutilated corpse lying on the bed was not in need of any immediate attention from me, and I also came to the conclusion that there was nobody else upon the bed, or within view, to whom I could render any professional assistance. Having ascertained that probably it was advisable that no entrance should be made into the room at that time, I remained until about 1.30p.m., when the door was broken open by McCarthy, under the direction of Superintendent Arnold. On the door being opened it knocked against a table which was close to the left-hand side of the bedstead, and the bedstead was close against the wooden partition. The mutilated remains of a woman were lying two- thirds over, towards the edge of the bedstead, nearest the door. Deceased had only an under- linen garment upon her, and by subsequent examination I am sure the body had been removed, after the injury which caused death, from that side of the bedstead which was nearest to the wooden partition previously mentioned. The large quantity of blood under the bedstead, the saturated condition of the palliasse, pillow, and sheet at the top corner of the bedstead nearest to the partition leads me to the conclusion that the severance of the right carotid artery, which was the immediate cause of death, was inflicted while the deceased was lying at the right side of the bedstead and her head and neck in the top right-hand corner.\nthe coroner said: It has come to my ears that somebody has been making a statement to some of the jury as to their right and duty of being here. Has any one during the interval spoken to the jury, saying that they should not be here to-day ?\nJulia Vanturney [Van Turney], 1, Miller's-court, a charwoman, living with Harry Owen, said: I knew the deceased for some time as Kelly, and I knew Joe Barnett, who lived with her. He would not allow her to go on the streets. Deceased often got drunk. She said she was fond of another man, also named Joe. I never saw this man. I believe he was a costermonger.\n[Coroner] When did you last see the deceased alive ? - On Thursday morning, at about ten o'clock. I slept in the court on Thursday night, and went to bed about eight. I could not rest at all during the night.\n[Coroner] Did you hear any noises in the court ? - I did not. I heard no screams of \"Murder,\" nor any one singing.\n[Coroner] Were you in the house when Joe Barnett called ? - Yes. I said, \"Well, Mary Jane, I shall not see you this evening again,\" and I left with her two men's dirty shirts, a little boy's shirt, a black overcoat, a black crepe bonnet with black satin strings, a pawn-ticket for a grey shawl, upon which 2s had been lent, and a little girls white petticoat.\n[Coroner] Have you seen any of these articles since? - Yes; I saw the black overcoat in a room in the court on Friday afternoon.\n[Coroner] Did the deceased ever speak to you about being afraid of any man ? - She did not.\nInspector Beck, H Division, deposed that, having sent for the doctor, he gave orders to prevent any persons leaving the court, and he directed officers to make a search. He had not been aware that the deceased was known to the police.\n[Coroner] Was it by your orders that the door was forced ? - No; I had an intimation from Inspector Beck that the bloodhounds had been sent for, and the reply had been received that they were on the way. Dr. Phillips was unwilling to force the door, as it would be very much better to test the dogs, if they were coming. We remained until about 1.30 p.m., when Superintendent Arnold arrived, and he informed me that the order in regard to the dogs had been countermanded, and he gave orders for the door to be forced. I agree with the medical evidence as to the condition of the room. I subsequently took an inventory of the contents of the room. There were traces of a large fire having been kept up in the grate, so much so that it had melted the spout of a kettle off. We have since gone through the ashes in the fireplace; there were remnants of clothing, a portion of a brim of a hat, and a skirt, and it appeared as if a large quantity of women's clothing had been burnt.\n[Coroner] Can you give any reason why they were burnt ? - I can only imagine that it was to make a light for the man to see what he was doing. There was only one small candle in the room, on the top of a broken wine-glass. An impression has gone abroad that the murderer took away the key of the room. Barnett informs me that it has been missing some time, and since it has been lost they have put their hand through the broken window, and moved back the catch. It is quite easy. There was a man's clay pipe in the room, and Barnett informed me that he smoked it.\n[Coroner] Is there anything further the jury ought to know ? - No; if there should be I can communicate with you, sir.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T04:55:47Z", "url": "https://www.casebook.org/official_documents/inquests/inquest_kelly.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Constant development in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) technologies results in evolving aircraft, instrumentation, and control programs of these systems. An open source simulator was examined as a potential method of testing UAS platforms changes. The open source simulator was used to simulate flights flown by an actual platform. Existing flight data was used as a base line of comparison for the telemetry data of the simulated flight. Patterns in parameters such as vehicle attitude and throttle output were compared between the simulated and actual results to determine if the simulator produced an accurate representation of a physical flight. Analysis of the simulated vehicle exhibited similar behavior to that of the actual vehicle in most of the flight data collected. Simplification in the flight simulator model may be responsible for the deviations in magnitude observed between the two sets of data. Three points of interest in each of the three test cases were chosen as checks for the values in the data. These points in the flight were studied in the various graphs of the parameters graphed and the difference between the simulated and actual values was calculated. The values at these points stayed within an average of 0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 for vehicle attitude and between 0% and 33.3% throttle difference over the three test cases. The average difference in attitude was 5.1\u00b0 over 93 compared values and 8.1% in throttle over 18 compared values. On average the simulator showed good agreement to existing flight data and therefore will be a good tool to simulate flights prior to a mission. The accuracy of the results may be improved with further development of the simulation model.\nRamirez Duarte, Jaime A.

{"text": "I grew up with stove top mac and cheese. Luckily my mother often made her own from scratch, but I also had the commercial boxed mac and cheese as well. Personally I\u2019ve always prefered stove top to baked. I know, it is controversial. There is something to that velvety sauce and soft texture. It is simple and concise.\nHowever, as I grew up, the idea of making it from scratch seemed more and more improbable. So I leaned toward the box. Now I am not saying that something is bad if it is in a box but powdered things often don\u2019t feel super healthy in the food realm. Especially if all you are adding to them is butter and hot sauce and maybe tuna from a can. Wait. What?\nYes. I would like to take a moment to address something that we call \u201cShame Food.\u201d What is Shame Food? Shame Food is food that you only feel comfortable eating in private. Far from any witnesses. My big Shame Food experience was when I was doing social work. I would work all day in a pretty intense environment and then commute home and my wife worked another 5-6 hours. So I would get home, eat something, and then take a nap. That thing became my Shame Food. It was inspired by a natural food company\u2019s spicy mac and cheese. (It has since been discontinued.) I would make mac and cheese and add a lot of cheap hot sauce (this was before we had a sauce business) and a can of tuna. I would not even plate it. I would eat the whole thing out of the pot and then take a nap. I mean the nap wasn\u2019t a choice. That box of noodles is meant to feed a family of four. Plus the amount of hot sauce I added meant I wasn\u2019t really enjoying the meal as much as surviving it. I had to recoup.\nThis recipe isn\u2019t that dish. It is tied to that spicy boxed macaroni and cheese, that my wife introduced me to, and we would eat it together at a time that we didn\u2019t eat much. Also the roots are a stove top mac and cheese. The kind where the only powder involved it mustard powder and the spice comes from a complex sauce with a bright balsamic flavor and a nutty essence that pairs well with the gruyere and trust me if you finish it with toasted sesame, you will not regret it. Please enjoy and feel free to share with us your Shame Food.\nPour the pasta into a strainer and place the empty pot back on the stove.\nTurn heat to medium and add the butter.\nOnce the butter has melted, stir in the flour and use a whisk continue for a minute.\nSlowly add the milk and cream while whisking to combine.\nAdd the mustard powder and stir.\nReduce heat to medium-low and add the mascarpone. Continue to whisk.\nBegin adding the cheese a handful at a time while whisking to combine.\nAdd the Hatch Sesame Balsamic Sauce.\nReturn the pasta to the sauce pan and stir to coat.\nIf the sauce seems a little loose then continue to stir the pasta occasionally on low heat.\nServe in bowls topped with toasted sesame seeds and Mexican oregano.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T11:53:51Z", "url": "https://marshallshautesauce.com/blogs/recipes/hatch-sesame-balsamic-macaroni-and-cheese", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Last night a few of us from The Bier Abbey had the opportunity to stop down the Capital Region\u2019s newest brewery, Rare Form Brewing Company, meet owners Kevin Mullen and Jenny Kemp, check out the new space, and of course try some beers they had on tap. It was a breath of fresh air, for both the continuation of the improvement of Troy, but also for the craft beer scene in the Upstate New York.\nThe taproom itself looks bigger than it really is, given that the brewery is directly behind the bar. The bar area holds about 40 people, with a small room off to the side available for private groups or holding tastings. Stools and standing room are available at the bar, while there are some tables and benches off to each side.\nThe brew house is a Beast 5 BBL system from Psycho Brew that allows for brewing either a double batch or two beers at the same time, which will be nice to do some smaller experimental batches.\nThe taps are split between the two sides of the bar, each side with its own glass rinser, which is good to see (nothing worse than putting good beer in a dirty glass). There will be a couple of nitro offerings, as well.\nWhile looking around I was a little confused exactly where their cooler was, not realizing there was a downstairs not readily visible from the bar. Kevin took me for a quick tour of the cooler they made themselves. It looks like they have plenty of Rare Form branded cooperage hiding out down there.\nBack at the bar, glass sizes vary depending on the beer and ABV, and as Todd pointed out last night it would be nice to see glass sizes listed on the chalkboard as well. There are still some folks who don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d that not all beers are meant to be served in a 16 ounce glass, and it can be a shock when someone is served a beer in a glass half the size than what they were expecting.\nAs for the beers themselves, I\u2019ll be honest, whenever I walk into a new brewery opening up in the Capital Region, I have my reservations and things were no different yesterday at Rare Form. I\u2019ve been burned more often than I would like to admit by local brewers who started as homebrewers, were encouraged by friends and family to start brewery, and never really upped their game. Kevin has been brewing in various stages for \u201cmore than half [his] life\u201d at this point, and I gotta say I walked away extremely impressed.\nSabbatical Session Ale \u2013 a session rye ale coming in under 4% ABV with enough rye to keep things interesting without being over the top by the end of the glass.\nL\u2019homme Chat Belgian Black Ale \u2013 an odd beer, as \u201csession Belgian black ale\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily roll off the tongue but this definitely worked surprisingly well. I thought about adding this in Untappd but I couldn\u2019t figure out what style to consider this. I\u2019ll let someone else figure it out. Also below 4%.\nWee Plaid Scottish Ale \u2013 tons of malty caramel notes without being cloying.\nCascadia Double IPA \u2013 a DIPA with a \u201cmalty backbone\u201d and some piney, some citrusy hops.\nKarass Robust Porter \u2013 a classic porter I was unfair to compare side by side with Hill Farmstead\u2019s Everett. Still, Karass held it\u2019s own and had a simple, but great roasty flavor.\nSatan\u2019s Gut Oak-Aged Imperial Stout \u2013 a big beer, with some coffee notes and oak present from the oak chips but not much from the bourbon the chips were soaked in.\nFirst off, all of the beers were extremely drinkable. I like the focus on the session beers which are already very popular this year and\u2026 I feel bad that I need to even say this but\u2026 none of them had any glaring flaws or tasted like the dreaded \u201chomebrew on a bigger system\u201d as mentioned above. I\u2019m sure Kevin is going to do some tweaks as he gets used to brewing consequetive batches on this much bigger system and the beers are only going to improve.\nThe one change I would love to see would be with the Cascadia Double IPA. Just from a demographic perspective, in 2014, in this location, we live where New England\u2019s Gandhi Bot and Coriolis will kick in a matter of hours. We have no problem driving to MA to Tree House or VT to Alchemist/Hill/Lawson\u2019s for IPAs. And Rushing Duck\u2019s War Elephant is one of our most popular local beers. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that malty and piney are not characteristics Capital Region folks are craving for in their IPA, and most of the time any malt presence in an IPA is usually considered \u201cold\u201d to beer geeks these days. I\u2019d love to see Rare Form offer another IPA where the malt steps aside and lets some super juicy, tropical, citrusy notes shine, as that\u2019s more in line with what\u2019s popular in the Northeast today.\nBeyond the beer, some Rare Form swag is also available including shirts, sweatshirts and aluminum growlers for beer to go, although I did not see pricing for growler fills. No #properglassware yet but I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll happen down the road.\nAs Rare Form is the beginning of the transformation of the corner of Congress St and 4th, I got the chance to check out the progress with the rest of the space, including The Shop, a beer bar that\u2019s adjacent to the brewery. The opening is still a couple of months out, but some of the detail in the work happening there currently looks insanely good. A delicatessen at the corner of the building is also in the works and overall the building is shaping up nicely.\nAs some of you know, I\u2019m a little (OK, a lot) harsh on breweries in Upstate NY. Living here, but having such great beer being made in all around us in New England has definitely made me a little jaded at this point. The big breweries in New York seem to be on cruise control, taking little to no risk with new beers. The smaller breweries, while opening up in rapid numbers haven\u2019t done much to shake things up either, and most wouldn\u2019t meet the standards set for the beers poured at The Bier Abbey (the only one I can think of off the top of my head that does would be Rushing Duck).\nThat said I have high hopes for Rare Form. They have a great brand, a website that looks like those of an established brewery, a small, but well put together tasting room, and brewing equipment that doesn\u2019t look like it is meant for homebrew or cobbled together from used parts from other breweries. Not to mention they are making some beer that\u2019s worthy of my recommendation to friends and fellow beer geeks for a brewery visit, and I would gladly serve to a patron at The Abbey if and when they\u2019re producing enough liquid for distribution. I see a lot of potential for Rare Form, and I wish Kevin and Jenny the best of luck.\nRare Form\u2019s Grand Opening is tomorrow, Friday May 30th at 4:30PM. Make sure to head down there to check them out!\nYou lift me up, then you let me down. I\u2019m talking about that Cascadia IPA of course. (I think it\u2019s a bit aspirational to call an 8.8% ABV beer a \u201cdouble\u201d. Imperial, maybe.) War Elephant, now that\u2019s an IPA to my liking. Hope the folks at Rare Form are paying attention to your comments.\nEven if they keep Cascadia the way it is there are still room for other IPAs in their lineup as well. Not that Cascadia is bad, just not the style I was hoping for.\nI had the Wee Plaid, Sabbatical and Satan\u2019s Gut when the owners came down for a cheese tasting at The Cheese Traveler. Most breweries in the Upstate area put out mediocre beer. Rare Form is not most breweries. I must say the Sabbatical is an excellent session ale.\nI think the Sabbatical is my favorite beer they do so far. Such great flavor out of a such a small beer, exactly what I want as these temps warm up.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T05:16:18Z", "url": "https://thefuj.com/2014/05/29/sneak-peak-at-rare-form-brewing-company-troy-ny/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Aman Ullah is with Ro Nay San Lwin and 93 others.\nThe UN Security Council has issued a presidential statement on Myanmar complimenting and criticising the country over its stance on the Rohingya crisis and it also gave the government a month to \u201cget its act together\u201d. The 1,300- word statement was read out by the sitting President of UNSC Sebastiano Cardi, the Ambassador of Italy, at a formal UNSC session on Monday ( November 6, 2017) .\nA presidential statement is a statement made by the President of the Security Council on behalf of the Council, adopted at a formal meeting of the Council and issued as an official document of the Council.\nA Presidential Statement is often created when the United Nations Security Council cannot reach consensus or are prevented from passing a resolution by a permanent member\u2019s veto, or threat thereof. Such statements are similar in content, format, and tone to resolutions, but are not legally binding. The adoption of a Presidential Statement requires consensus, although Security Council members may abstain. The Statement is signed by the sitting Security Council President.\nIt was the first presidential statement in 10 years on Myanmar. The Security Council has adopted such statements against Myanmar only three times, with the last one coming a decade ago. Diplomats hailed the move as a unified international stand against a humanitarian crisis that has been called \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d by the U.N., U.S., France and the U.K.\nIt strongly condemned attacks against the Myanmar security forces carried out by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on August 25, and then expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over the government\u2019s response, the alleged burning of villages and threats to villagers to flee, among others.\nIt called for reform in Myanmar\u2019s security and justice sectors and urged the government to work with Bangladesh and the UN to allow the voluntary return of refugees to their homes, on the basis of an October 24 memorandum of understanding between the two country.\nThe panel welcomed a \u201cunion enterprise mechanism\u201d for humanitarian assistance, resettlement and development in Rakhine.\nIt recommended the government ensure the mechanism supported such return and allow UN agencies full access, urging governments and all humanitarian partners to pay special attention to the needs of women, particular survivors of sexual violence.\nThe council said the government\u2019s primary responsibility is the protection of Myanmar\u2019s population, citizens or not. The statement reiterated concerns and demands previously laid out: an end to excessive military force in Rakhine province, a lack of humanitarian access for the U.N., a right of return for refugees, and steps to address the root causes of the conflict. The statement included most of the demands contained in a draft resolution presented last month by Britain and France, but that measure ran into strong opposition from China, a supporter of Myanmar\u2019s former ruling junta.\nIt is said that, China had indicated it was willing to resort to its veto power to block a resolution, but Beijing finally agreed to a statement during negotiations.\nThe action is one step below a Security Council resolution in diplomatic significance, but a step above the Council\u2019s previous action, a \u201cpress statement,\u201d in September.\nThe statement requires the U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to report back to the Council within 30 days on Myanmar\u2019s progress in addressing the Council\u2019s demands. The statement isn\u2019t as binding as a resolution would be, and carries no punitive measures, such as sanctions, if corrective steps aren\u2019t taken.\nThe Security Council has held a series of meetings on Myanmar since September, including a briefing attended by high-level officials on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly gathering. But efforts to respond forcefully have stalled despite widespread reports of deaths, rapes and torture of Rohingya Muslim minorities, including women and children, at the hands of the country\u2019s military.\nViolence erupted in August after a Rohingya militant group attacked Myanmar security forces. Since late August, more than 600,000 Rohingya have been driven from their homes by an army campaign that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing.\nDuring negotiations with China, language on citizenship rights was watered down in the statement as was a demand that Myanmar allow a UN human rights mission into the country, diplomats said.\nThe statement calls on Myanmar to cooperate with the United Nations and encourages UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to appoint a special advisor on Myanmar.\nThe council statement was agreed as Guterres prepares to travel to Manila this week to join leaders of the Southeast Asian (ASEAN) bloc for a summit.\nThe council also welcomed the Myanmar government\u2019s public support for recommendations by the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State chaired by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and called for their full implementation.\nIt urged UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to consider appointing a special advisor on Myanmar.\nSince the August attacks, over 604,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh. Some fled by land, others in boats over an inlet of the Bay of Bengal.\nIn the last two weeks, 4,000 refugees entered Bangladesh while four people drowned in a shipwreck while fleeing, officials said.\nU.K Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: I am pleased that today (6 November) the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has spoken with one voice on the appalling situation in Rakhine State, Burma. The UK has repeatedly called on the Burmese security forces to protect all civilians and act now to stop the violence and allow humanitarian aid to urgently reach all those who need it. The UNSC has today joined us in that call, with this historic Presidential Statement on Burma.\nI am encouraged to see State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi making important steps forward, including establishing a domestic body to deliver humanitarian and development assistance in Rakhine, and making efforts to promote interfaith and intercommunal harmony, including a recent visit to northern Rakhine. The UK will be watching closely to ensure that the Burmese security forces do not attempt to frustrate these efforts.\nThe U.K. and France initially circulated a proposed Security Council resolution on Myanmar in late October, but China and Russia refused to engage and negotiate, diplomats said. China finally agreed to a similar text with minor changes as a presidential statement\u2014which carries less weight than a resolution\u2014and Russia followed suit.\nMr. Guterres has been outspoken about the Myanmar crisis and urged the Security Council to prevent continued bloodshed and curb the refugee flow. Mr. Guterres will be among the world leaders attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit later this week in Manila.\nThe Rohingya refugee crisis is expected to be a top issue of discussion at the summit, to be attended by US President Donald Trump, who will dispatch US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to Myanmar later this month. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will also attend that summit.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T08:53:33Z", "url": "https://www.rohingyalanguage.com/2018/02/un-security-issues-presidential-statement-on-myanmar-10-years-later.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "In the past five years the percentage of weekly mobile banking users has more than tripled \u2014 from 9% in 2010 to 30% in 2015 \u2014 while weekly branch visitors fell from 40% to 24% in the same time frame. 2015 marked the first time that weekly mobile bankers (30%) exceeded branch bankers (24%) in Javelin\u2019s survey. \u201cWhat is driving this incredible growth? Smartphones and tablets are gaining rapidly in consumer adoption but it\u2019s also a function of the fact that mobile banking services have not only proliferated but increased in the quality and features they offer consumers,\u201d said Javelin analyst Daniel Van Dyke during a January 27 webinar reviewing the firm\u2019s Mobile Banking, Smartphone and Tablet Forecast.\nJavelin\u2019s recent report Digital Account Opening Reaches The Tipping Point also found that more Americans are applying for credit cards, loans and investment products through digital channels than physical ones. Javelin has argued that \u201cFIs that fail to divert resources from branch to digital suffer a large opportunity cost, missing out in lowered servicing costs for basic transactions and in sales of new products.\u201d The service costs argument rings particularly true for mobile deposit, with Chase citing a cost of 65 cents for each teller deposit vs only 3 cents using mobile. While 38 percent of big bank customers utilize mobile deposit, only 18 percent of community bank and 16 percent of credit union customers do, placing these institutions at a significant disadvantage in terms of service costs.\nThe branch network, which peaked at 99,550 U.S. locations in 2009, has dropped each year since. The latest FDIC figure of 93,283 represents a 6.3 percent decline in the last six years, although Bryan Yurcan of American Banker was quick to point out that \"most of that reduction has come with the nation's largest banks shedding inventory ... many smaller banks have held steady, and even increased, branch numbers.\"\nPredicting that account maintenance will increasingly be performed on mobile devices but there will be times that customers seek face-to-face advice, Schwanhausser said FIs need to \"get into the business where they're influencing the behavior of their customers, guiding them to a smarter way to manage their finances. Those are very personal kinds of conversations. It's not about eliminating (the branch) but how do we put the pieces together in a more coherent way?\"\nWhile early adopters of smartwatches tend to be affluent or part of Gen Y2 (ages 25-34), mobile bankers no longer carry such unique characteristics. As Van Dyke put it, \"The mobile banker of today is the banking customer of today. They're becoming indistinguishable.\" Mobile banking has become so commonplace that Javelin projects 80 percent of consumers will be engaging in it \u2014 on a 90 day basis \u2014 by 2020.\nIn 2015 74 percent of mobile banking users employed an app and 69 percent utilized a mobile browser, dwarfing the 31 percent using SMS text messaging. Schwanhausser said FIs will continue to wrestle with the question of what to make available in the app: \"Do you make it fine tuned and focused and streamlined or replicate what can be viewed in online banking?\" Van Dyke predicts that banks will continue to take advantage of device-specific capabilities, whether using the camera for mobile deposit or geolocation to identify nearby ATMs. \"Things like that will underscore the need to offer superior experiences on the app,\" said Van Dyke.\n2015 marked a continuation of Android's dominance, as the operating system grew its share of the U.S. tablet market from 45 to 48 percent and its share of the U.S. smartphone market from 47 to 49 percent. Apple's tablet share fell from 46 to 43 percent, with its smartphone share dropping from 46 to 45 percent. While Apple's numbers have been moving in the wrong direction Van Dyke reiterated that iOS users are the most valuable that an FI can serve. \"iPhone users show extremely unique characteristics. They bank more often, they make payments more often,\" said Van Dyke. \"When it comes to banks and payment providers iPhone owners are the gold standard.\" In addition to serving Android users, Javelin recommended that FIs prioritize an app on Amazon \u2014 but only after all iOS and Android device types have been addressed. Javelin suggested that there was no value in supporting Windows or Blackberry users, who only represent 4 and 2 percent of the smartphone market respectively.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T09:10:27Z", "url": "https://www.mx.com/moneysummit/mobile-banking-outpaces-branch-for-the-first-time", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "My husband is being posted to Darwin for work and we have decided to drive there. We are going in January and I know this is the wet season. My question is, do you think it will be safe travelling the Stuart Hwy to Darwin in a Holden Sedan at the start of January?\nWe plan on stopping at all the main towns for the night. I just worry about flooding on the Hwy and we are travelling with a child and want to make sure we are doing the right thing.\nJust use common sense. As long as you don't drive into any water deeper than 200mm, and you stick to the road and sealed parking bays (i.e. don't pull off the road into any soft shoulders), there is no problem at all. It's a normal highway.\nOf course there is always a chance of major flooding with the highway being cut by water deeper than that, which means you would have to wait for the water to go down before you can continue your journey.\nIt does happen nearly every year, sometimes more than once, but I really can't predict when and where or for how long. Only Petrus can tell you :-).\nKeep an eye on the weather forecast. Big rains do not come out of nowhere, they come out of big, monsoonal depressions. If one of those is heading for the region, then you may have to reconsider your driving plans.\nAnd of course, always check the road reports.\nHow did the travel go?\nThat must have been a long journey. I am thinking of traveling around Australia one day. How did the travel go?\nIn my opinion traveling from Melbourne to Darwin in January might be a bit uneasy, especially when you are planning to do it without any rescue baggage. There can be flash floods, and within just a matter of seconds the entire highway can become dangerous to travel on. Furthermore, while stopping at major cities for the night is a good idea, it doesn't take you out from the risk of facing floods. And of course, you are not going to like the idea of being stranded on the terrace of a roadside motel till rescue workers pull you guys out. Think over it. I guess you can come up with a better alternative than this.\nEditor's note: I removed your totally unrelated spam link, mate. If your comment wasn't a dead give away that you have never been anywhere near the north, the link certainly was.\nWell, we did it and thankfully had not one problem. There was rain but that stopped our journey because we were lucky enough that the water was off the Ed by the time we reached the apparent flooded areas.... It was a very long drive and all I can say is prepare\u2026 prepare\u2026 prepare. :-) Make sure you have everything you need in case of emergency and you should be fine.... Wishing you safe travels!\nI hope you have a safe trip to Darwin.\nI hope you have a safe trip!\nThat's a long trip you're planning mate, this is what you need: axe, sleeping bag, one huge sack of food, around 30-40 litres of water, some things your kid would like to do, phone, tent, 30-40 litres of oil, torch, 3 knifes, extra tyres (8 tyres), building tools.\nJoin in and write your own page!

{"text": "The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-member board is expected to support the plan, which was announced amid much hoopla on Nov. 13. The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years. That grant is worth an estimated $28 million but the county says it\u2019s not a grant just for Amazon, because the improvements will benefit other companies in the immediate area. Amazon will have a chance to express its opinion on how the county uses the money, although the board will make the decision.\nThe county also offered Amazon the possibility of using its fast, fiber-optic network connection, which would be the subject of a separate agreement if the company chooses to use it.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Amazon will pay the local business license tax because that tax is levied only on certain types of business, and Amazon has not yet announced which of its business units will be based in Arlington. If the company does pay the license tax, then some of its operations could be eligible for a discount of up to 72 percent under an existing program designed to attract technology companies.\nWhile Arlington pored over the details, the Virginia General Assembly passed, and Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam signed, an incentives package worth up to $750 million for Amazon.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T23:06:48Z", "url": "https://www.unionleader.com/news/business/arlington-virginia-board-plans-vote-on-amazon-incentives-after-lengthy/article_427512a0-3bf7-58ea-8d40-5791b74da305.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "So you have your children writing every day. Great! Now, of course, you need to become their editor. Here is where some find a challenge in the natural approach to language arts. What if I don\u2019t feel competent to edit my child\u2019s writing? We\u2019ll address the underlying problem with that argument further down, but for now \u2014 here are 10 ways to become a better editor of your child\u2019s writing.\n1. Read A Strong Start in Language.\nThis Ruth Beechick title for beginning grades is recommended widely \u2014 from The Well-Trained Mind to Sonlight. Typically packaged as part of The Three Rs, A Strong Start in Language helps you become the editor from the beginning \u2014 from the time your child traces his first letters, to copywork, and through dictation. Read our full review (scroll down).\n2. Read You Can Teach Your Child Successfully.\nOver 100 pages are devoted to writing in this followup to the Three Rs by Ruth Beechick mentioned above. The book speaks to you as your child\u2019s tutor and therefore includes writing activities, writing lessons to get you started and that you can pattern your own lessons after, and suggestions for usage, grammar, mechanics, and spelling. Best of all it tells you what you can expect from your child at various levels on the writing scale. Very valuable reference to finding your way as you teach writing naturally to your children and we cannot recommend it highly enough. You can read our full review (scroll down).\n3. Use Learning Grammar Through Writing.\nThis handy reference published by Educators Publishing Service is now out of print. But it is worth finding. When you find a mistake in your child\u2019s writing, you can find the coordinating pithy rule with an example to have your child copy into a grammar notebook. A checklist at the back helps you keep track of the skills you have covered.\nThe best way to improve your editing is to read good writing. While you work through the suggestions above, you can be building your foundation in good writing at the same time.\n5. Make use of a dictionary.\nBefore the days of Kindle we had electronic dictionaries handy that included a grammar reference. Although somewhat pricey, the better models not only include the definitions, but also the etymology of the word. Most also come with a built-in thesaurus and other tools. If nothing else, a good dictionary can shed some light on how words are properly used in sentences.\nNot popular with some, but a valuable skill for understanding how words work in sentences. There are easy online courses that can help you quickly learn the basics. For simple and easy practice we like The Complete Book of Diagrams by Mary Daily published by The Riggs Institute Press, which also is a great help for Mom.\n7. Use Learn to Write the Novel Way.\nWhile your child writes his novel as he works through this book, you have a guide that helps you edit your child\u2019s writing. Learn by doing. Read our full review.\n8. Read The Elements of Style.\nThis widely recommended classic by Strunk and White holds the title for the most concise and simple usage, composition, and spelling reference. There is even an early version in the public domain.\n9. Read How to Write Clearly by Ruth Beechick.\nSubtitled, The Meaning Approach, this is another handy writing reference that covers finding a topic, getting organized, outlining, using abstract and concrete terms, sentences, comma usage, active and passive voice, choosing words, usage, and more! Read our full review.\nIt\u2019s never too late. Having a working knowledge of how Latin works is probably one of the best ways to understand how the English language works.\nYou will also want a grammar reference. Our favorite grammar reference is the Handbook of Grammar and Composition published by A Beka. We purchased it on a recommendation in The Well-Trained Mind and haven\u2019t looked back.\nNow, back to the initial question: what if you don\u2019t feel competent to edit your child\u2019s writing? You do know how to write, yes? In this day of streaming output you may even write for a blog or other publication. Using the ideas above, you should be able to stay ahead of your child\u2019s work. Of course, at some point, if you feel you are losing ground there are many qualified and reputable online writing tutors available.\nWhat to have your child do.\nMore structure for those who need it.\nWhere to put the writing.\nYou\u2019ll also want to have your child keep one of these.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T14:59:16Z", "url": "https://diyhomeschooler.com/2016/01/20/10-ways-to-become-a-better-editor/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Her older church friends tell similar stories about their surgeries, how they count backward from ten with an oxygen mask over their faces, then wake up before reaching one, only to find that hours, and sometimes even days, have gone by. She feels as though she were experiencing the same thing.\nDecisions that affect others in bad ways cannot always be traced to one individual.

{"text": "Educating women, in particular, has unmatched transformative power. It not only empowers them but also has a positive effect on their family and surroundings. Women with more education tend to have fewer children, which benefits them, their families and the society at large. Education is also one of the most powerful elements of improving people\u2019s health. It saves the lives of millions of mothers and children, helps prevent diseases, and is an essential component of efforts to reduce malnutrition. Educated mothers are better informed about diseases; therefore, they take preventative measures, recognize signs of illness early and tend to use health care services more often.\nTo create awareness regarding the importance of girl child eductaion, SOC Films in collaboration with Chime of Change, created a series of short documentaries on young girls who want to achieve their dreams and aspirations to seek excellence in various professions in future whether it's sports, literature, science, math, activism, or so on and so forth. Chime for Change, a global movement is aimed at strengthening voices speaking out to support the cause of promoting justice, health and education for girls and women the world over. These documentaries were screened at an event in New York on 11th October this year, which is also celebrated as the International Day of the Girl Child.

{"text": "My stepson decided he wanted a Pokemon birthday this year. The Pokemon figures are pretty hard to make into a cake so I decided to make the Pokeball, which is just a round ball, half red & half white.\nI\u2019ve been wanting to try my hand at decorating a cake with fondant after washing billions of hours of Charm City Cakes\u2019 amazing creations and \u2018the Cake Boss\u2019. Obviously this would not be anywhere in the same league as the cakes they create, but you have to start somewhere, right?\nI have to say that even after making the fondant, I was still surprised at how heavy it was when it came down to decorating the cake. It\u2019s not like pie dough where you can roll it onto itself and move it. You actually need to decide ahead of time to bring the cake closer to you. I found this out after having finally kneaded the fondant so it was just right and then rolling it to just the right thickness and then trying to get it to my cake\u2026 And having it rip apart and fall on the floor\u2026 Thus having to start all over with a new piece. And I did this TWICE before moving the cake. Ugh. Sometimes my brain doesn\u2019t work!\nAnyway, once I moved the cake and got a feel for the fondant, it went pretty smoothly.\nThen I went to add the final touches, which I thought would be the easiest part\u2026 I had that icing in a can with the writing tips. That\u2019s what I used for the black lines I needed. It came out in globs and made a mess. Then I tried to \u2018fix\u2019 it by making another line so maybe it would look like it was supposed to be thicker. It looked awful! Oh well. It was black, it\u2019s not like I could take it back off and start over (the fondant instantly took on the color!). I decided to just be happy the fondant worked.\nBut then, because I can\u2019t just leave well enough alone, I had to write on the cake. I used that same icing in a can, this time in blue. Maybe it\u2019s just me. I don\u2019t think I can write on cakes. The writing was awful and I was very upset about it. I do have a really nice set of cake decorating tips so next time I\u2019ll see if I can do any better with the decorations using homemade icing.\nThe actual cake was just a white box cake, I made a blue and a green layer and then I cut each layer in two so it would be a 4-layer cake. I made a delicious vanilla buttercream to frost it. I also added a layer of sprinkles :). I wish I could post a pic of the inside but it was so late after trick-or-treating last night, it never got cut!\nI think I\u2019m going to go eat the leftover vanilla buttercream!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T22:56:16Z", "url": "https://natalietriestocook.wordpress.com/2013/11/01/fondant-covered-pokemon-cake/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Without a doubt she is the biggest public relation's splash ever in the transgender community. Now we have a former Olympic hero along with Navy Seal Kristin Beck as recent \"coming out\" stories. In fact, Kristin is running for US Congress.\nI am sure Jenner's life will ever allow her to ever experience the everyday lives we live as transgender women. Can you imagine the paparazzi crowding into a women's restroom with her?\nAfter watching her last show rater intently (and knowing it's a glossy over produced Kartrashian show) I couldn't see the emotion in Jenner. Again, I don't know all the facts about her, except she went out and bought the best plastic surgery money could buy. Again, maybe that's why I can't see any emotion in her face-she can't move it!!!!\nPlus, I have no idea how long she has been back on HRT. It took me three years on hormones to begin to see the world in a different way. When I watch Jenner, I wonder if she has passed over (no pun intended) to the feminine side much at all. She tries to overtalk most people and doesn't want to listen for the real problems-typical male.\nThen again, maybe I am just watching the true quandary of a Mtf gender transition play out with Jenner. I don't question the pure persistence and strength it takes to jump the gender fence. It will be interesting to see in the years to come what happens with Jenner.

{"text": "Both the federation of states and the federal super-state describe the same zero-sum game from different angles. Either there is one single state of Europe (federalism), in which case there are no national member states; or else the national member states remain Europe\u2019s rulers, in which case there is no Europe (inter-governmentalism). Within this framework of thought, whatever Europe gains, the individual nations lose. And this is true whether one is for a given option or against it. Caught up in the false alternatives of the national gaze, we are given the choice between no Europe or no Europe.\nThe decline of the nation-state is really a decline of the specifically national content of the state and an opportunity to create a cosmopolitan state system that is better able to deal with the problems that all nations face in the world today. Economic globalisation, transnational terrorism, global warming: the litany is familiar and daunting. There are a host of problems that are clearly beyond the power of the old order of nation-states to cope with. The answer to global problems that are gathering ominously all around and that refuse to yield to nation-state solutions is for politics to take a quantum leap from the nation-state system to the cosmopolitan state system. Politics needs to regain credibility in order to craft real solutions.\nMore than anywhere else in the world, Europe shows that this step is possible. Europe teaches the modern world that the political evolution of states and state systems is by no means at an end. National realpolitik is becoming unreal, not only in Europe, but throughout the world. It is turning into a lose-lose game.\nEuropeanisation means creating a new politics. It means entering as a player into the meta-power game, into the struggle to form the rules of a global order. The catchphrase for the future might be: move over America, Europe is back.\nThe EU uses money for things that the various countries governments would not dream of spending it on, such as regional projects, culture, the arts and so on.

(Don\u2019t tell anyone, but I\u2019m fairly addicted to my phone, which contains all my appointments, mail, reminders, to-do lists, Facebook, Twitter, Messenger, Google, and favorite games.) These days, the \u201cmust-have\u201d gadgets are endless\u2014from smartphones, iPads, laptops, and gaming equipment right down to 3D home TVs! If you\u2019re able to have some of these nice things and enjoy them and they help you with your work and studies, or are also a fun source of entertainment, technology can be great. But it\u2019s good to step back sometimes and imagine what it would be like if one day all those things instantly disappeared. After your initial withdrawal symptoms, you\u2019d realize that life goes on without material things. What matters most are our loved ones\u2014our friends and family members. Sometimes we can forget this truth, and that\u2019s when we tend to act selfishly.\nThe act of giving not only helps those we give to, but us as well. Luke 6:38 says, \u201cGive, and it will be given to you.\u201d2 Sometimes what you get back will be something tangible, such as the Lord supplying things you need or someone giving to you, but more often than not what you receive in return is the satisfaction that you did something good. Have you ever given someone something they really needed or wanted and watched their face light up? It\u2019s an amazing feeling!\nAn old American movie from the 1930s called The Man Who Played God is about a concert pianist who lost his hearing in a bomb explosion. He finally got through his depression when he learned how to read lips. He\u2019d watch people in Central Park (New York City), where they\u2019d talk about their problems and troubles, and he would do what he could to solve their problems anonymously. I think it would be amazing to do something like that, to know what other people need and be able to secretly give it to them.\nThere is a cute kids\u2019 song that one or two of you may have heard when you were knee high to a grasshopper, called, \u201cI\u2019d Like to Be Invisible.\u201d The singer wishes he was invisible so that he could \u201cspread love everywhere, and help in secret ways without you knowing he was there.\u201d (Yup, it even rhymed!) The truest part of the song, though, is where it concludes that you don\u2019t have to be invisible, because you can do things to make a difference all around you. You can make it a point to look for where the need is and do what you can to fill it.\nIt\u2019s a funny story but it rings true. It\u2019s easy for me to think that if I had a million dollars, I\u2019d love to give it away to help people, or to ponder all the great things I\u2019d do for my family with money like that; but when it comes to giving away a small portion of my free time to parents who could use a break from their kids, or doing a favor that costs me in the here and now, that\u2019s where the true essence of giving really kicks in.\nI know a lot of missionaries who do great works of evangelism and charity, and it\u2019s inspiring to read about the orphanages they help and the seminars they host, and all the other great projects they do. However, I have a very personal description of what makes a missionary: it\u2019s someone with a giving heart. That means not only do they do big, impressive (and usually well-advertised) works to help the poor or disadvantaged, but they\u2019re also always there to lend a helping hand whenever there is a need. They give to their own hurt; and they don\u2019t ask for or expect favors in return. They don\u2019t have a personal agenda. They just give. And you can feel their love and kindness in their actions. They\u2019re the ones you only ask for help when you really need it, because you know they\u2019ll do everything in their power to help you. In return, you want to do anything you can to help them. Their lives are examples of cheerful and selfless giving.\nI would love to be remembered as someone like that! Sure, we all have bouts of selfishness, and human nature tends to take the path of least resistance, but it\u2019s something to strive for, don\u2019t you think? Sometimes giving can be as simple as a sincere compliment, a hug, or a word of appreciation. It can also be giving your favorite gizmo to your little brother or sister when it would mean the world to them.\n3 Kahlil Gibran (January 6, 1883\u2013April 10, 1931) was a Lebanese artist, poet, and writer.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T22:34:30Z", "url": "https://just1thing.com/podcast/2014/4/18/to-give-or-not-to-give.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "HOW do we explain why 5.5m French voters in the first round of the presidential elections voted for far-right parties that are xenophobic, anti-semitic, racist and ultra-nationalist? Sounding off about the wrongness of the vote will not help understand the reasons underlying their choice. Everybody in politics needs to begin an urgent, thorough and much-needed self-criticism.\nThe vote may have been a valuable wake-up call for France if it opens the eyes of party leaders and revives the debate on how to build a nation based on justice and solidarity. What vanished in April was the comforting thought that although everything was changing in the world outside, in French politics everything could stay the same; that two ageing parties, the Gaullists and the Socialists, could share power as they had done for 30 years.\nPeople have sensed for some time that these two political forces are worn out. Their historic mission seems to have ended. Each in its own way gives the impression of an organisation going nowhere, with crumbling infrastructures, no organisation or programme, no ideology, no identity and no compass for the journey ahead.\nPrevious elections had already shown that neither party was capable of addressing the needs of millions of people who are genuinely frightened by the new realities of the post-industrial world that has emerged after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war. The disposable workers, the underclasses of the banlieues, the long-term unemployed, the excluded, the many people pushed into early retirement, the young people in precarious jobs, the families on the brink of poverty. For all these, the recent past has brought years of fear and anxiety, with many familiar landmarks apparently gone forever.\nThe Socialist party in particular, with almost no working-class people in its local organisations and several leaders in the supertax bracket, gives the impression that it lives on another planet, light years from the experiences of ordinary people. It has shown itself remarkably insensitive to what Daniel Mermet describes as \u201cthe sufferings of under-France\u201d.\nWhat about the right? Some conservative politicians see the far right as untouchable, but others have been happy to do electoral deals with it. The former liberal leader, Michel Poniatowski, recently wondered in public whether it was \u201cany more immoral to accept the votes of communists, who murdered millions of people in Europe, than those of the National Front\u201d (1). This perverse logic allowed Christian Democrat leaders of the Union pour la d\u00e9mocratie fran\u00e7aise (UDF) to accept National Front votes in 1998 to be elected to the presidency of five French regions.\nWhile this plague infected the inner workings of France\u2019s political institutions, was it reasonable to imagine that France would remain immune to the upsurge of far-right politics in its immediate neighbours (see Fascism isn\u2019t what it used to be, by Jean-Yves Camus, in this issue)? Or likely that France would be the exception when, like other European countries, its social fabric has been violently rent in the name of modernity: by liberalism and globalisation, European unification, the decline in national sovereignty, the abandonment of the franc, the disappearance of national borders, the hegemony of the United States, multiculturalism, loss of identity and the crisis of the welfare state?\nAll this happened in the context of the end of the industrial era and technological transformations that led to widespread economic insecurity and terrible social malaise. In such a context, with competition raised to the status of a natural imperative, an increase in violence and criminality was inevitable. The abruptness and brutality of these changes meant that uncertainties are accumulating as horizons have been lost, the world seems less clear, and history appears to defy logic and understanding. Ordinary people have felt abandoned by governments of both right and left; unsurprisingly, since the press describes them as corrupt, as liars and cheats.\nMany people feel lost and panicky; as Tocqueville put it,\"since the past no longer illuminates the present, the human spirit walks in darkness\". Old magicians have returned to conjure with this new obscurantism, this breeding-ground of fear, confusion and resentment. Their rhetoric is demagogic, authoritarian and racist; they talk of a return to the old values (work, family, motherland) and blame foreigners, Arabs and Jews for all the disorders, social problems and insecurities. Immigrants are an easy target, always available, because they symbolise social upheavals, and among the lowest-income earners they are seen as unwanted competition.\nAlthough it is absurd, hateful and even criminal, the rhetoric of the National Front has long appealed to more than one in four French people according to the opinion polls (2). On 21 April it gained the electoral approval of millions (30% of the unemployed, 24% of workers, 20% of young people and 17% of employers).\nThe Republican awakening expressed in street demonstrations all over France translated into anti-Le Pen votes on 5 May. Neo-fascism will not be voted in during the parliamentary elections in June either. But once the moment of fear has passed, if the parties carry on as before, with privatisation, dismantling public services, creating pension funds and accepting sackings to keep shareholders happy, if they continue to deny people\u2019s desires for a society that is fairer, more fraternal, more based on solidarity \u2014 then there is no guarantee that fascism, in alliance with the usual collaborators, will not win next time.\n(1) Lib\u00e9ration, 20 March 1998.\n(2) Le Monde, 13 April 1996.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T11:47:10Z", "url": "https://mondediplo.com/2002/05/01plague", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Summer is the best time to set started \u2013 you\u2019ll beat the heat (in and out of the kitchen) and eat seasonally at the same time!\nThis beautiful summer salad will brighten up any meal. Great with peaches or try cherries, nectarines or plums!\nOver the years, I have been trying to incorporate more raw foods into my diet and here\u2019s why: I want to stay feeling and looking young, and free of disease. Plant-based foods are the best sources of disease-fighting antioxidants, inflammation-fighting polyphenols, and a host of nourishing vitamins and minerals and I want to load my body up with that protective goodness!\nBut a completely raw diet can be complicated and expensive. And I am a busy, working mom who\u2019s a foodie, to boot. My goal is to find ways to easily prepare and enjoy more live raw food as a way of adding more healing nourishment into my diet. You don\u2019t have to eat 100% raw to feel the energizing benefits. But it does take a shift in how and what foods you prepare. All you need is a little know-how to get started. Here are the steps that I took to get started.\nIt\u2019s tempting to make a drastic dietary change because we just want to feel better NOW. I commend your enthusiasm but remember, it is better to start small and follow through, then go big and get overwhelmed and give up. Choose one thing and stick with it. Try adding a green smoothie to your morning routine or swapping out your regular lunch for a big, raw salad. Once you\u2019ve made this first step a part of your routine, add something else. These little steps will lead to big health changes over time.\nWhen starting a new way of eating, it\u2019s common to focus on what you are losing. Instead, concentrate on what power foods you can add to enhance the nutritional value of each meal. Eating more plant-based foods may encourage you to experiment with different cuisines, along with new herbs and spices. Yum, yum! Don\u2019t worry about what you\u2019ll need to give up. Focus on what you\u2019re gaining: flavor, nutrition and energy.\nNo need to over-complicate and feel stressed out! Start by sticking to the basics: smoothies, soups, salads, slaws. Over time, you will expand your collection of delicious, healthful, amazing raw plant-based recipes.\nFind a day that works for you and take 30-40 minutes to prepare your fruits and veggies for the week ahead. Grate veggies (carrots, radishes, zucchini) for salads. Cut and freeze fruit for smoothies. Make staples to keep on hand (salad dressings, hummus, cooked grains). A little work today will help you make healthier choices all week long!\nIdeally, every Sunday you have all of your meals planned and veggies prepped. Sound too hard? Start by planning two or three recipes for the week. I like to keep a folder of \u201crecipes to try\u201d in my kitchen for inspiration. Save time with leftovers and always keep raw snacks like nuts and apples with you. A little planning does the trick!\nHere is a salad to get you started: it can be used for a side at dinner or bring it the next day for lunch by adding it to a wrap with hummus. It will keep nicely and actually tastes better the next day!\nSo try adding some raw, plant-based dishes to your meal plan this week! I\u2019ll be back next week with some more ideas and delicious recipes to help you moving forward towards a healthier, plant-based, deliciously raw table!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T08:56:20Z", "url": "https://theenergizedbody.com/adding-raw-plant-based-meals/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "When it comes to divorce in Salt Lake City, each party has a lot to lose\u2013especially if you have children or significant assets. One of the most complex issues is the division of assets and property. Utah law requires the distribution to be equitable. In many divorce cases, both parties are unable to agree how to divide property and assets. It can often create an acrimonious situation. An experienced and knowledgeable Salt Lake City divorce lawyer can often make the difference between getting the settlement you deserve to losing everything you have rightfully earned.\nIn most Utah divorces, there are three major assets that are usually involved\u2013the home, personal property and retirement plans/investments. Here is a brief rundown on how Utah courts determine equitable asset and property division.\nHome & Property: Many of the most heated divorce cases in Salt Lake City involve which party is entitled to receive the home. The court can use several different methods of determination. Here are the most common depending on the circumstances of each case. First, the court may order the house to be sold and equity divided among the two parties. The court may also allow one party to buy out the other person\u2019s interest in the real property. Another common ruling is to have the property awarded to one party and the remaining assets of equal value given to the other.\nPersonal Property: Personal property is classified as the ownership of any material possessions that can be moved. It includes cars, furniture, and clothing. While most people do not share clothes, the determination of vehicles and furniture can sometimes become complex\u2013especially if they are co-owned by each party. Utah courts place a priority on dividing personal property equitably.\nRetirement Plans & Investments: The division of retirement and investment accounts can sometimes get complicated under Utah family law. If only one party has a pension or retirement plan, in most cases the other party is entitled to half of the amount earned during the time of the marriage. Any money earned before the marriage will not be divided. If both parties have their names on investment or retirement plans, the court can rule either two ways. Both individuals can retain the full value of their own plans or the court will order an equitable distribution of all accounts.\nIn a perfect world, divorcing couples can agree to divide assets and property on their own. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. But there are some solutions to come up with a reasonable agreement. One viable option is mediation. Many Salt Lake City divorce attorneys offer mediation services to help couples find common ground on some of the most difficult family law issues. Under Utah family law, both parties are required to undergo at least one mediation session to attempt to resolve their differences. A mediator is an independent arbitrator who can listen to both sides explain their issues and concerns. It is often a less stressful alternative to court is also far less expensive than going through the conventional divorce process.\nTo learn more about your options concerning the division of assets and property, contact Salt Lake City divorce attorney Emy A. Cordano for a consultation today.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T22:00:17Z", "url": "https://www.felonylawyersattorneys.com/determining-equitable-division-assets-property-salt-lake-city/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The Eastern Playoff race has been decided. The Carolina Hurricanes have drawn the first wildcard spot and will face the Metropolitan Division-leading Washington Capitals in the first round of the playoffs. The New York Islanders will be the second seed in the Metro and will have to square off against the Pittsburgh Penguins. In the Atlantic Division, the Columbus Blue Jackets end up with a tough match-up as they will face the Tampa Bay Lightning, while the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs will meet once again, as everyone has known about for quite some time. The final results of the night will determine how the Western Conference Shakes out.\nThe Colorado Avalanche\u2019s Mikko Rantanen was spotted on the ice Saturday in San Jose wearing a non-contact jersey, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The injured forward, who hasn\u2019t seen action since March 21st with an undisclosed injury, traveled with the team but will sit out once again. While that doesn\u2019t sound like great news, considering the playoffs are right around the corner it is better to have him skating than not. If Colorado has any chance of advancing out of the first round, they will need their young scorer. The 22-year-old will have played eight less games than last year, but has a career high 31 goals and 87 points in his sophomore season. Avalanche head coach Jared Bednar said later today that he is hopeful that Rantanen will be available for the playoffs, according to BSN\u2019s Adrian Dater.\nSpeaking of injuries, the Pittsburgh Penguins got some good news as defenseman Brian Dumoulin skated on his own after missing the past three games with a lower-body injury, according to Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Dumoulin, who normally skates alongside Kris Letang, would make a big impact on a lineup that is preparing for the playoffs and could use the player tied for fifth in the NHL with a +31 rating. \u201cThe fact that Dumo is on the ice is really encouraging from our standpoint,\u201d Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. He added that the injury isn\u2019t considered major and Doumolin remains day-to-day.\nThe St. Louis Blues expect to get back defenseman Colton Parayko, who has sat out the past two games with an undisclosed injury. The 25-year-old defender is expected to play in the playoffs, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u2019s Jim Thomas. Thomas added that Tyler Bozak was just held out for precautionary reasons Saturday after he was in a car accident getting to the game. The veteran center was rear-ended, but wasn\u2019t seriously hurt. He too is expected back for the playoff opener.\nAs the Blackhawks pass through another disappointing season, the team must continue to focus on development. The team has a nice group of prospects coming up the pipeline, but there are many that are starting to worry about whether the Blackhawks are doing the right thing with defenseman Henri Jokiharju, their 2017 first-rounder.\nThe Blackhawks, not known for developing defensemen recently, loaned Jokiharju out to Finland for the World Junior Championships, against the youngster\u2019s wishes even though they eventually won the gold medal. Since his return, the team has changed course in his development, moving him over to the left side, his off-side which will help make room next season for right-hand shot Adam Boqvist, and has had his ice-time cut, according to The Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required). He even was a healthy scratch recently.\nHead coach Jeremy Colliton said the changes are being made to make sure the youngster won\u2019t burn out like many rookies do during their first season.\nThe Colorado Avalanche suffered a key loss Saturday as the team will be without defenseman Erik Johnson, who suffered a concussion during their game against Los Angeles. The veteran defenseman is expected to be out for the next two games and head coach Jared Bednar hopes he\u2019ll be back after the All-Star break, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The defensive-minded blueliner averages 21:42 of ATOI and is a key figure on the team\u2019s defense.\nThe Avalanche also had good news in practice as defensive prospect Conor Timmins, who has missed all of the 2018-19 season so far with a concussion, practiced today with the team even if it was in a non-contact jersey, according to BSN\u2019s AJ Haefele. Bednar said after the practice that Timmins will begin ramping up activities over the next couple of weeks and they will see if he\u2019s ready to go when the team returns after the All-Star break. Timmins, the team\u2019s second-round pick in 2017, could help the team down the stretch if he\u2019s deemed ready.\nTed Wyman of the Winnipeg Sun looks back at the first half of the season now that the team hits their bye and All-Star week, suggesting that while many things have gone right for the Jets, perhaps the most disappointing part of the season has been the play of star forward Patrik Laine. The scribe writes that the third-year winger is having a miserable season despite having 25 goals at this point. Despite an 18-goal November, Laine has tallied just seven goals combined in the other three months and often looks like a rookie on the ice. Of course, he\u2019s only 20 years old still, so patience is needed.\nAfter struggling for much of the season and recently seeing his ice time dwindle, Tyson Jost is headed back to the AHL. The Colorado Avalanche today assigned Jost and Ryan Graves to the Colorado Eagles, giving them just 21 players on the roster.\nJost, 20, was the tenth overall pick in 2016 but has yet to really establish himself in the NHL. After a great freshmen season at the University of North Dakota, the offensive center signed his entry-level contract and made his debut down the stretch for the Avalanche. Last year he returned to the lineup full-time and recorded 22 points in 65 games, but has failed to really take a step forward in 2018-19. Jost hasn\u2019t been asked to play center on a regular basis this season given his struggles in the faceoff circle, and it\u2019s not clear exactly where he fits into the lineup in a perfect scenario.\nThat fit will have to be determined through his play in the minor leagues, as the young forward was clearly not progressing in the NHL. In 43 games he has just 15 points, despite being given ample opportunities on the powerplay for much of the year. Given that he does not penalty kill and is seeing fewer than ten minutes of even-strength ice time in recent weeks, playing in a top-six role for the Eagles is probably the best for his development. Jost can obviously be recalled at a moment\u2019s notice given the proximity of the AHL team, and currently does not require waivers.\nGraves meanwhile could be back up before the Avalanche hit the ice on Saturday against the Los Angeles Kings, but he too had been used extremely sparingly by head coach Jared Bednar during his time in the NHL. The 23-year old defenseman has logged fewer than 12 minutes of ice time in each of his eight appearances, though he does have two goals already to show for his short NHL career.\nPoll: Should Colorado Move Semyon Varlamov?\nThe Colorado Avalanche returned third-string goalie Pavel Francouz to the AHL today. Yet, at this point in their season, it is fair to ask whether that move actually makes the team better. The Avs finally snapped a six-game win-less streak on Friday night against the New York Rangers and have fallen out of the once-competitive Central Division race over the past month. Colorado\u2019s struggles are not singular in nature \u2013 a lack of secondary scoring and a struggling penalty kill have played a part \u2013 but poor performance in net has been the most pressing issue facing the team. After a hot start to the season, Semyon Varlamov has regressed to a .912 save percentage and 2.80 GAA and has missed the team\u2019s past two games with a lower-body injury. Off-season acquisition Philipp Grubauer has yet to settle in with Colorado, holding a career-worst .902 save percentage and 3.13 GAA thus far.\nConsidering that Varlamov\u2019s play is not currently winning games for the Avalanche, the team could opt to move on from the veteran keeper. Despite Varlamov\u2019s recent slump, the impending unrestricted free agent would still be a valued name on the trade market as the NHL Trade Deadline grows closer. Several teams will be looking for a rental for the stretch run and postseason and Varlamov could potentially be the closest thing to a bona fide starter that could hit the market. Why then would the playoff-bound Avalanche want to move Varlamov if he\u2019s still a top NHL option? The return would be substantial and could \u2013 either directly or by flipping part of the return \u2013 result in Colorado adding the forward depth they so desperately need. It was recently reported that the Avs are hesitant to move their top prospects and young roster players for help, which could force them to move an established veteran like Varlamov.\nThe Avalanche could benefit from some addition by subtraction when it comes to Varlamov as well. The aforementioned Francouz, in his first season in North America after an illustrious European career, has made the transition look easy this season. Recently named an AHL All-Star, Francouz, 28, has a .919 save percentage and 2.65 GAA through 23 games with the Colorado Eagles. Perhaps more impressively, Francouz has made two NHL relief appearances and has saved 33 of the 35 shots that he faced (.943 SV%). The Denver Post\u2019s Sean Keeler writes that head coach Jared Bednar considered making Francouz the starter over Grubauer last night and opined that the current third-string could be the X-factor for the Avs this season. Francouz is also an impending UFA and the team should take a longer look at him this season to determine if he could be a long-term option alongside Gruabauer. An extended stay in Denver this season would certainly help convince Francouz to stick around as well.\nOf course, if the Avalanche were to trade Varlamov this season, it would very likely hurt their chances at a Stanley Cup title. Despite his struggles, Varlamov has outplayed Grubauer and has years of success to fall back on, as opposed to his young backup and Francouz, an unproven import. Colorado would likely have to turn around and add another option in net if they were to trade Varlamov. However, given that the Avs face a probable playoff route through the Nashville Predators and Winnipeg Jets this season, it could be that they favor improving the team for the future rather than clinging to slim title chances. The team could also feel that addressing their needs at forward is a priority compared to maintaining depth in net.\nWhat do you think? Should the Avalanche change things up by trading Varlamov for young pieces or forward help and hand the reins to Grubauer and Francouz? Or should they hold on to their established starter in hopes that it is their best chance at a Cup run this season?\nThe Colorado Avalanche announced they have recalled goaltender Pavel Francouz from the Colorado Eagles of the AHL. Head coach Jared Bednar said that Semyon Varlamov was a little banged up and Francouz was recalled as a precaution. The 28-year-old was up earlier this month and was impressive in a relief stint on Dec. 22 when he saved 21 of 22 shots against Arizona in 29 minutes of work. Francouz, who signed as a free agent with Colorado in the offseason out of the KHL has performed well in the AHL as well, posting a 13-7-1 record and a .919 save percentage. With Varlamov expected to hit free agency at the end of the season, Francouz could be a strong candidate to fill the backup role next season.\nThe Carolina Hurricanes have assigned forward Janne Kuokkanen to the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL, according to CapFriendly. The 20-year-old prospect has had trouble finding a positive role with the Hurricanes, despite being dominant in the AHL. Kuokkanen has yet to score in seven games and has seen his playing time dwindle to under 10 minutes in the past three games. He will return to Charlotte where he has already equaled his goal output from last year and can continue working on his game. The team followed that up announcing the promotion of Saku Maenalanen from Charlotte to fill Kuokkanen\u2019s shoes. Maenalanen has appeared in just one game for the Hurricanes, but has scored seven goals and 14 points in 31 games for the Checkers.\nWhile it\u2019s already been reported that the Chicago Blackhawks\u2019 recent trade acquisition Jason Garrison cleared waivers earlier today, NBC Sports Charlie Roumeliotis reports that Blackhawks\u2019 general manager Stan Bowman said Garrison will be assigned to the Rockford Ice Hogs of the AHL. Garrison, picked up in Sunday\u2019s trade with Drake Caggulia for Brandon Manning, has played in 17 games with the Oilers this year. He did play 58 games with the Chicago Wolves last season when playing for the Vegas franchise.\nAfter two years in the Swiss League, former NHLer Bobby Sanguinetti has returned to North America, as the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL announced they have signed the 30-year-old veteran to an AHL deal. The defenseman, who played 45 games with the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes, played with the Checkers for three years before spending the last two years in Switzerland. Sanguinetti, a former first-round pick in 2006, will hope to resurrect his career there.\nThe Nashville Predators announced they have assigned Nicholas Baptiste to the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL. The team recalled him Monday to serve as an emergency player for their game against Washington, but now have returned the 23-year-old without getting him into a game. Baptiste has played 34 games for Milwaukee and has six goals and 14 points.\nThe Minnesota Wild have recalled defenseman Ryan Murphy from AHL Iowa per a team release. This will be the 25-year-old\u2019s first stint in the NHL this season but he has 172 games of NHL experience between Carolina and Minnesota over the past six seasons. Murphy has played in 27 games in the minors this season with three goals and 10 assists.\nThe Colorado Avalanche went out of its way to bring in goaltender Philipp Grubauer via trade during the offseason to be their heir apparent in goal, but with Semyon Varlamov playing well throughout this season, Grubauer hasn\u2019t had much of a chance to claim that role. However, that might be changing.\nWith the team having lost five of their last seven games and Varlamov struggling, the team got a brilliant performance from Grubauer on Tuesday as he saved 35 shots in a 2-1 win over the Montreal Canadiens. After that performance, The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark (subscription required) wonders if this is the turning point where Grubauer takes over as the team\u2019s No. 1 goaltender. With Varlamov slated to hit unrestricted free agency this summer, the team needs for Grubauer to take that next step and that looks to be the case. In the last six starts (not including Friday\u2019s 2-1 loss to Chicago), the 27-year-old is 5-0-1 with a 2.29 GAA and a .936 save percentage.\n\u201c(Grubauer) gives us a chance. He gives us a real good chance,\u201d head coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cHe keeps it at 1-0 and guys are saying the right things on the bench. \u2026 I just felt like he looked really solid in the net. Like he was in control tonight. I haven\u2019t felt that way about our goaltending for the last little bit and that\u2019s what we need.\nThe Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required) writes that when winger Brendan Perlini was traded from the Arizona Coyotes to Chicago Blackhawks, he had high hopes that a change of scenery would jumpstart his career as he has struggled to put up points. However, while the Blackhawks liked what they have seen from center Dylan Strome, Perlini quickly found himself on the team\u2019s fourth line and even found himself a healthy scratch early on. \u201cTo be honest, you never like to sit, but it\u2019s good because I can watch the game and say, OK, here\u2019s certain spots where maybe I can get the puck or things like that or realize watching I can settle down there, there\u2019s a lot more time than I actually think. Like I said, you never like watching, but you can take good things from it. I think I\u2019ve done that and just try to build off it and learn every day.\u201d Perlini since then has looked much more comfortable and has picked up a couple of goals in the past four games. The hope is he continues to make adjustments in Chicago\u2019s lineup.\nKen Wiebe of the Winnipeg Sun writes that with the impressive play shown by Winnipeg Jets\u2019 goaltender Laurent Brossoit can be attributed back to last year when the back-up lost his job in Edmonton to Al Montoya and he found himself in the AHL for the remainder of the season. That experience made him work harder to get back to the NHL. \u201cNow I\u2019m more aware of who I am as a goalie and as a professional, if that makes any sense,\u201d said Brossoit. \u201cIt was unfortunate I had to go through those growing pains during my biggest opportunity with that club. I wouldn\u2019t say that I performed at the level I normally do.\u201d Brossoit was offered to return to Edmonton, but instead opted to start fresh in Winnipeg.\nThe NHL has issued a $2,000 fine to Colorado Avalanche forward Mikko Rantanen, citing two instances in which he broke Rule 64 for Diving/Embellishment this season. Fines will increase for Rantanen for any subsequent instances, and eventually include financial punishment to head coach Jared Bednar as well. The first incident, which garnered just a warning, was on October 16th against the New York Rangers, while the latest was during a November 14th game against the Boston Bruins.\nRantanen has been one of the league\u2019s brightest stars this season and still leads the entire NHL in scoring with 32 points. His play alongside Nathan MacKinnon has been a revelation, and has the Avalanche poised to become one of the league\u2019s most dangerous offensive teams. Unfortunately with this history, he\u2019ll now be watched even more closely by the officials and may not get the benefit of the doubt on close calls. He also could very well draw the ire of his coaching staff if he causes them to be fined, or costs his team with an ill-timed penalty.\nWith a dominant top line that includes Nathan MacKinnon, Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen, the Colorado Avalanche can\u2019t be happier as they have combined for 75 points so far this season. However, the biggest concern for the team has been their secondary scoring, which most recently seems to have improved when the team re-inserted center Tyson Jost together with wingers Alex Kerfoot and Colin Wilson, according to Kyle Newman of the Denver Post.\nJost had spent some time with that line earlier this year, but between a demotion to the team\u2019s fourth line and an injury that kept him out for four games, Jost finally got a chance to center the two wingers and has made the most of his opportunity with a pair of goals in the past week as well as improved play from both Wilson and Kerfoot.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T02:31:08Z", "url": "https://www.prohockeyrumors.com/coaches/jared-bednar", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Considering last fall\u2019s wet weather and the soggy fields this spring, farmers wonder about using inoculants on soybean seed in 2010. Should you use a rhizobium inoculant? Or, is there enough of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Bradyrhizobia japonicum, remaining in the soil?\nTrue, rhizobial bacteria don\u2019t survive wet conditions very well. But whether it will pay to use an inoculant depends largely on whether soybeans were grown in the field sometime during the last five years or if the field has been flooded for more than a week, says Aaron Saeugling, Iowa State University Extension field agronomist in southwest Iowa.\nThe presence of rhizobia in the soil is necessary for a legume such as soybeans to be able to convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form usable by the plant, he says. This process, nitrogen fixation, is critical for producing high soybean yields. For nitrogen fixation to occur, the nitrogen-fixing bacteria need to be readily available in the soil or must be applied to the seed.\nWhen soybean seed germinates, the rhizobia bacteria invade the root hairs of the seedling and begin to multiply. Nodules, the structures that house the bacteria, form on the roots. Under field conditions, nodule formation can be seen shortly after emergence, but active nodule fixation of N from the air doesn\u2019t begin until about the V2 to V3 growth stage of beans. After that point, the number of nodules formed and amount of nitrogen fixed increase with time until about midway between the R5 and R6 growth stages; then N fixation decreases sharply.\nApplying nitrogen fertilizer for soybeans isn\u2019t recommended because it typically doesn\u2019t increase bean yields in Iowa production systems. The total number of nodules that form decreases with increasing amounts of applied N.\nToday, most fields in the Midwest have had soybeans grown on them in the crop rotation, likely increasing population density of Bradyrhizobia bacteria in the soil, notes Saeugling. Improved inoculant technology, coupled with higher commodity prices, ease of application and relatively low-cost inoculant products, have many growers reconsidering the use of inoculants.\nSince 2003, ISU agronomists have conducted trials each year to assess new inoculants on the market. Overall, the ISU studies haven\u2019t shown a consistent yield response to use of soybean inoculants in fields in Iowa with a history of having soybeans grown on them.\nCurrent recommendations for Iowa are to inoculate the seed if a field has never been planted to soybeans, or if beans haven\u2019t been grown in the field for the past three to five years. Other situations where it\u2019s recommended to inoculate are if soil pH is below 6.0, or if a field has sandy soil, or if a field has been flooded for more than a week, creating anaerobic conditions.\nRising cost of production and volatile commodity prices are driving the need for soybean growers to improve profits. But the use of inoculants to increase yield may not be the answer, especially if beans have been grown in the field recently. In fact, using inoculants on soybeans without an active on-farm testing program could be costing you money. But if a field hasn\u2019t produced soybeans in the past three to five years or has never produced soybeans, an inoculant is needed for nitrogen fixation to occur.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T22:34:34Z", "url": "https://www.beefmagazine.com/tackntogs/when-inoculate-bean-seed", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

However, this is a significant cut above your average chain restaurant.\nHaving been seated in a sleek, modern dining room, all polished wood and crisp white tablecloths, we opted for two set dinners, assured by the helpful Ma\u00eetre D\u2019 that the fixed price menu was made up of the restaurant\u2019s finest dishes.\nA selection of starters was dominated by a pair of eye-catching Dragon\u2019s Whisker Prawns, succulent king prawns encased in a cocoon of fine shredded pastry. Another highlight was a portion of Honey-Glazed Ribs, a sticky treat, the meat falling pleasingly away from the bone.\nNext up was that traditional takeaway staple, Aromatic Duck, served with the obligatory pancakes, hoisin sauce and spring onions. Done well, it\u2019s a thing of beauty, and happily, The Good Earth does it very well indeed, the duck beautifully tender, its skin crisp and tacky. Delicious.\nFinally, the mains. Chicken with Cashew nuts was another traditional dish done well, but Fillet of Beef in Claypot was the star performer, arriving still sizzling at the table, the flavour of the meat more than living up to the spectacle.\nAt just under \u00a340 per person, without wine, this Chinese banquet comes in a shade more expensive than your typical neighbourhood restaurant, but given the quality (and quantity) of the food on offer, it\u2019s well worth the extra outlay.\nIf you are looking for another reason to check out the area, visit The Ship pub in Wandsworth, which is ideal for summer drinks on the large terrace.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T18:24:32Z", "url": "http://bonvivant.co.uk/journal/the-good-earth-restaurant-wandsworth/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Far Left Van Jones Admits that Trump Can Win and Gives Major Warning to Democrats - Video - Stumpin' For Trump!\nCNN contributor and former Obama aide Van Jones put out a warning to his fellow Democrats on Friday: Donald Trump is probably going to win the White House.\nIn the Facebook video, Jones credited Trump\u2019s ability to understand and use social media and reality television as well as his appeal to black voters as reasons he will likely win the White House in November.\nJones likened Trump to Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama in the sense that they all excelled in a new medium that no other politician could easily master.\n\u201cJust like FDR changed the rules of the game because he mastered radio, he was able to take radio and just completely master that \u2014 then you had JFK and JFK was able to master television \u2014 new medium, new master, new president,\u201d Jones said.\nHe continued to detail how Trump has been able to use his celebrity to appeal to parts of the Democratic base, especially black voters.\n\u201cIf only 70 percent don\u2019t like Donald Trump, that means 30 percent are open to his argument, if he gets half of those, he\u2019s president,\u201d Jones said.\nA Public Policy Polling report released on Monday showed Jones might be correct in his opinion that Trump is winning over large segments of the Democratic Party\u2019s most loyal voting bloc. The poll showed that in the swing state of Ohio, Trump would garner 15 percent of the African American vote against Clinton, with another 11 percent undecided.\nThat is huge increase from the 4 percent of the black vote Mitt Romney received in Ohio during the last presidential election.\nWell, well, well, even the ex-Obama-Czar-self-proclaimed communist understands and sees how Trump can win and be our next President! Wow! I\u2019m a bit impressed, but I wouldn\u2019t trust Van Jones with a lollipop either! Trump is pulling in some of the more modest democrats over to vote for him, and with the help of these two infamous Internet sensations, Diamond and Silk, created a place for them to do just that, called \u201cDitch and Switch\u201d, for anyone who either voted democrat all these horrible years and now sees the \u201clight\u201d in voting Trump, or whom never voted before and wants to sign up as soon as possible to exercise their constitutional right to vote, they can go to Diamond and Silk\u2019s website, and sign up. They can help direct you to the right place. Thanks, Van Jones, for your analysis of a Trump win, and he can do this, if every ethnic group would just open their eyes to see what the last 7 years have really done to them; not for the \u201cfreebies\u201d they get, for as long as they are listed poor, they can get the freebies, but is that what you really want? Just the freebies that this administration \u201cgives\u201d you? And where do you think that money comes from? Thin air? The upper clouds? Take heed, people, realize, that in history, in other parts of the world, where \u201cfreebies\u201d were a given because the people were poor and destitute, they were \u201ccontrolled\u201d by that government as long as they did the government\u2019s bidding, they got the freebies, so they just didn\u2019t work or even try looking. Then the government puts them to work, moves them to high rise buildings, stuffs other families with them in small apartments, and makes them go to work in plants, day in day out, but they get free housing, free food (which is rationed out periodically), and free stuff, but then it gets pulled because the government can\u2019t afford any more free stuff (phones, ipads, ect.). Take heed, this has happened, and it can happen again. Trump will get you back to a job you want and be proud of working because he\u2019ll limit the regulations of businesses who hire workers who want to work, and not hire out to foreigners either. You deserve a job, you\u2019ll get a job. Get off the freebie stuff because it\u2019s not going to last you a lifetime. Socialism only lasts long enough before the gov\u2019t runs out of money to sustain it.\nCommentary: Are polls underestimating Trump\u2019s support?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T15:06:11Z", "url": "http://stumpinfortrump.com/2016/05/08/far-left-van-jones-admits-trump-can-win-gives-major-warning-democrats/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "By Cecile Green and Rebecca Fisher-McGinty, republished and edited from Round Sky Solutions blog.\nEnlivening Edge Magazine has republished Part 2 of this article here.\nSo many of us have experienced bad meetings ranging from mildly frustrating to intolerable! In fact, bad meetings are so common, it\u2019s easy to assume they are an inevitable part of the status quo. If you have a small business, a nonprofit, board meetings, organizing meetings, a worker cooperative, or are interested in democratic or teal workplaces, you likely have to participate in meetings that drive you nuts for a variety of reasons. If so, you are in the right place, we wrote this post for you! In Part 1, we\u2019re going to focus on some of the things that come up during these meetings and then part 2, we\u2019ll share some solutions.\nPeople getting offended and defensive.\nPeople being accusatory and snide.\nPeople disengaging during the meetings and at all times.\nUpdates that go on forever and are not helpful.\nA few people that have too much responsibility.\nOnly a few people doing all the talking.\nWell intentioned people delivering inconsistent accountability.\nAgenda items that only reflect the needs of a few.\nAgenda items that take way too long and don\u2019t lead to meaningful outcomes that move things forward.\nMeetings with no clear ending that drag on for hours.\nSince bad meeting culture is so endemic it\u2019s easy to think that it\u2019s normal or unavoidable and I\u2019m here to tell you that while it may be normal, meaning that it happens all the time in all kinds of organizations, it\u2019s not healthy and it is entirely avoidable!\nSaps organizational energy and focus. There\u2019s nothing like an argument in the middle of a meeting for making everything worse.\nWastes time. Meetings are the most efficient way to sync up and align. When they are wasted with no clear decisions or next actions, people still have to obtain that information or risk doing bad or useless work. The work of obtaining that information outside of meetings represents a waste of time.\nSense of being stuck increases. It leaves people feeling powerless and frustrated leading to disengagement.\nUnderscores the sense of being overworked and underappreciated. When we don\u2019t have good mechanisms for redistributing work because we can\u2019t really see what other people are doing or not doing, it\u2019s easy for people to feel unseen and unappreciated for their work.\nMakes it harder to address important issues and get good work done. When meetings are wasted on conversations that go on way past any point of usefulness for the organization, the time we have to discuss and decide on important issues dwindles.\nGetting to facilitating effective, collaborative meetings can be challenging but is well worth the effort. Imagine what it might be like for you to have a organization full of inspiring leaders, with tools that enable you to hack your meetings into flows and effective outcomes? Well, for one thing, improving your meetings will save you time and energy and open up the space for everyone on the team to be more of their full selves, which simply feels better, and frankly gets better results.\nWith a generative meeting culture, here are a few things you can look forward to, including what some of our clients and students have shared about our work!\nEngaging and efficient collaboratively-led meetings. The power of joy and fulfillment that comes from productive efficient meetings goes on to infuse all of the work we do with that same motivating force, bringing much more meaning and productivity to everything that we do.\nWorking together productively with flow and satisfaction. Collaborating with others can be profoundly frustrating, and that frustration is a drain on both the organization and the individual. Getting to flow and satisfaction produces a host of benefits including longevity, in other words, people sticking around to contribute to an organization\u2019s success.\nNot getting stuck on issues. The feeling of being stuck in one\u2019s work with others is corrosive, especially if it\u2019s a consistent feature of meetings. Being able to move forward even on difficult issues is like opening the windows in a stale room and letting the light and air in.\nBetter innovation and problem solving. Working together is all about facing challenges and surmounting them with each other. Being equipped to do so efficiently, creatively, and innovatively is critical to organizational success in the complex and constantly changing business environments that we all find ourselves in today.\nMutual support & accountability. One of the biggest challenges of collaborative work environments where we are explicitly sharing power is accountability, both how we support each other in getting our work done, and how we hold each other accountable in the process.\nA real distribution of power and voice. This one is huge! If you really want to get innovating and feel some meaningful engagement from your team, try giving them real power.\nAnd the best part about learning all this is that you are going to be able to use these skills over and over again in all kinds of different contexts. It\u2019s like you\u2019ll have cracked the collaboration code and have super powers for enabling people to get along and do better work together.\nStay tuned for part 2 that will include 4 hacks and tangible tools to make your teal and democratically led meetings more effective and engaging.\nDo you resonate with the challenges of collaborative meetings? Who hasn\u2019t sat through a meeting that was poorly facilitated?? It can really put a damper on the work. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created this online training to support and train collaborative facilitators to really hone in on what\u2019s needed to get the work done in a collaborative and meaningfully inclusive way.

{"text": "Here in Australia, Boxing Day is our \"Black Friday.\" It's the day after Christmas Day and stores have massive sales to help get rid of any post Christmas stock. While it's been a huge event for our department stores for many years, online shopping has made grabbing a bargain much easier (with the added benefit of not having to battle people for the last gift box!).\nAdelaide has no Mecca Maxima stores, so I had to order the Urban Decay Gwen Stefani Eyeshadow Palette from Mecca online. While this has been available for a while in the US, it was only released on Boxing Day here.\nI'm IN LOVE with this palette. I feel like it was made for me. I know a lot of people have said there's not much in the way of colour selection, but for someone pale it's the perfect palette.\nIt retails for $95 here in Australia so it's pricier than the other palettes that UD sell, but you really see the amount of thought that went into both the palette and the packaging and shade names.\nThe packaging is gorgeous although it's quite heavy. I can't wait for the rest of the UD x Gwen collection to be released.\nLipstick Republic is an Australian online store that sells brands like Sigma, OCC, Lime Crime, Jeffrey Star, Morphe and more. They had 25% off so I put in an order for some products that were on my wishlist.\nI have previously ordered a Benjabelle Brush Tree from them and I wanted to buy another one. I already have the Mini Brush Tree, which holds 24 eye brushes but I wanted to get a large brush tree that also holds large brushes. I decided on the Sunflower Brush Tree as it holds both small and large brushes.\nI also ordered the spinner bottom as I don't have it on my other brush tree and I wanted to see if it was more helpful while washing my brushes.\nI've never been one for Sigma brushes (youTubers pushing their code down my throat makes me side eye the company) but I received a mini E25 Blending Brush in a Bellabox previously and I really loved it, so I ordered a fullsize one from their copper line. I also ordered the Sigma E45 Small Tapered Blending Brush as you can never have enough blending brushes. I thought that this would be great for me as I have small eyes and some blending brushes are bigger than my eyes!!\nAnd finally I ordered the Barely Cosmetics Definer Soft Sponge to apply my foundation. I like the shape of this. I haven't tried this yet. I can't wait to see how it compares to my beauty blender and RT sponge.\nI love Soda & Co's Instagram page of their natural body products and lipbalms. Their packaging is super cute and I love their pictures. When I saw that they had 30% off, I decided to finally make an order.\nBecause I haven't tried their products before, I decided to buy a pack that includes a body wash, body lotion and a sugar scrub that's in an adorable cosmetics bag.\nI struggled with which scent to choose from (pink lemonade, mint burst or orange splash) but finally decided on pink lemonade as I was worried that the others would smell like bathing in toothpaste or orange juice.\nI've been using them and the body lotion is the stand out for me. It feels thick when I put it onto my skin but it seems to melt and sink into my skin quickly. The sugar scrub is also amazing for leaving my skin smooth and soft. While I like the body lotion, it's a more subtle scent than the lotion and scrub.\nI hope that they eventually sell a vanilla or a lavender range as their 3 current scents are quite uplifting and I love using something relaxing at night.\nDid you purchase anything in the Boxing Day sales?\nAwesome Boxing Day haul! I didn't buy anything in the sales - trying to cut back!! I have the same brush tree and I love it!! I love my E25 minis but now I want to try the E45!\nThe brush tree is wonderful. It makes washing my brushes so much easier and less hectic.\nI haven't touched the sales since I'm waiting on Priceline's 40% off skincare sale sometime this month.\nI'm lusting after that same Benjabelle brush tree you bought! I own that same Sigma tapered blending brush (albeit with the silver ferrule & writing, not the copper) & if I'm honest, I don't like it. Whilst it feels soft at first, after you wash it it becomes scratchy...or at least that's what's happened to me. Not sure what I can do to get it soft again...maybe use some conditioner?\nThe brush tree is fantastic. I'd recommend it!! It makes cleaning your brushes a lot easier and less messy.\nOhh that's no good! What do you wash your brushes with?\nI can't remember what I washed that one with at first, but normally I use a mild shampoo (Moogoo's one) to wash my brushes. I might've used that, but I'm not sure why it made the brush scratchy, unless I was using the wrong product for the type of brush that it is (I think it's synthetic hairs?).\nBrush trees are so great, aren't they? I wouldn't mind trying that scrub.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T16:20:30Z", "url": "http://www.bottledbeauty.com/2016/01/boxing-day-collective-haul-featuring.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "best year ever | The Jamestown Comet.\nResolving for a better new year.\nWell, the holidays are upon us once more and 2016 is nearing an end. It\u2019s safe to say that the past year has certainly been filled with remarkable change. What did 2016 mean to you? Was it an end or a beginning? Did you experience triumph or tragedy?\nIf you\u2019re like most, it was a mixture of both. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to discern the difference. What some see as catastrophe, others view as a success. It really depends on your perspective. Of course, the New Year is always a good time to make a change for the better in your own life.\nBut be aware that most statistics show that only around 46 percent of resolutions continue past six months. At the same time, people who set a goal based on a resolution are 10 percent more likely to succeed than those who do not.\nHowever you do it, in order to change your life for the better you have to get up and take the first step. And, sometimes attitude is everything where life changes are concerned.\nYou have to stay positive, dismiss the naysayers and keep motivated and moving forward. So, whether you start because of a resolution or just because you think now is a good time, your potential success or failure rests largely with your motivation.\nAdditionally, remember that you can\u2019t force someone else to change either. If they want a different life, they have to take the steps toward that end.\nFor example, suppose Lisa is dating Mike and she\u2019s having a tough time because he is addicted to role-playing games. Lisa wants to eventually marry Mike, but she cannot handle the gaming.\nLisa believes, however, that she can change him, help him to see the error of his ways. She believes that she can set a resolution to reform him with love \u2013 or a rolling pin (just kidding, she doesn\u2019t bake \u2013 she actually uses a frying pan).\nMike is never going to change because someone else wants him to do so. If he wants to quit playing he will have to do it for his own reasons. I am certainly no psychologist, but I do know that for any New Year\u2019s resolution to be successful, the desire to change has to come from within.\nI may be wrong, but I think the motivation for change at the start of a new year comes from a deep desire in all of us for a fresh start. Most people want to strive for something better, no matter what our situation. Of course, there are still people out there who simply don\u2019t care and are either complacent or resigned.\nFor some, the new year offers an opportunity to get \u201cit\u201d right \u2013 whatever your particular \u201cit\u201d happens to be at the time. In any case, it\u2019s up to you to make those choices and follow through. If you don\u2019t, you have no one to blame but yourself.\nYou can get things moving by creating a list of the things you want to accomplish in the coming year. For the record, I\u2019d leave out a lottery jackpot and focus on more realistic expectations, like finishing your education or pursuing a career change.\nThen figure out what it takes to reach those milestones and make a plan to get there (the \u201cmake a plan\u201d part is pretty important). You will likely have a great deal of work to do and, for some at least, a long-term goal may require multiple short-term steps. Be patient, work hard and stay focused.\nIncidentally, staying focused may indeed be the biggest challenge you face. The aforementioned plan is vital. Lay it out, be consistent, stick to it one step at a time, rather than trying to do everything all at once, and you can be successful.\nA New Year\u2019s resolution can be either a step towards improving your life or it can be a fruitless, frustrating endeavor that causes you stress and worry. It all depends on how committed you are to the kind of change you want in your life. However you do it, the choice rests with you.\nGery L. Deer is an independent columnist and business writer.

{"text": "Accidents are very common today. There are many accidents that happen every day. These accidents cause traffic congestion and can take hours to clear. When vehicles were first introduced not all could afford it. Further it was not considered as a worthy investment. Only a few people used it. Over time the demand and usefulness of vehicles began to show. This caused a huge demand which resulted in the world we live today. The moment we step out of our houses we see roads. Vehicles have become so important that we use more than half of the land for roads. This by itself shows the importance we place on vehicles and the affect it has on our daily lives. All of us use vehicles to travel and it is a crucial requirement. This requirement has been increasing while the number of vehicles has increased. The increase has resulted in congestion of the road. Congestion is not the only reason for accidents, there are many. Here are the main reasons for vehicular accidents to occur.\nThe main reasons for accidents are when the driver gets distracted. This results in the driver ignoring the road and what is in front. Usually the main distractions are phone calls, text messages, smartphone usage, looking somewhere else and meddling with the radio. These accidents are dangerous as well. The driver may hit a bystander.\nSpeeding is a large cause for accidents. When the driver speeds he may lose control. This can be very dangerous in a highway where many cars can pile up when there\u2019s a single accidents. Speeding can cause an accident around a large area due to the force the vehicle impacts on. It can claim many live and may require powerful Nissan patrol wreckers to tow the vehicles away.\nDrunk driving is very dangerous and is a criminal offense. When a driver is drunk he or she is impaired and cannot drive properly. Even though it is an illegal activity it is very common. This is mostly due to young people. Drunk drivers can also speed and cause accidents. Drunk driving can result in every other accident such as reckless driving, running the lights, running stop signs are some of them. Police vehicles and various towing vehicles such as the Nissan 4\u00d74 wreckers Perth will be needed to clear the scene.\nReckless driving is another common cause of accidents. Reckless drivers are impatient drivers who may drive in an unlawful manner to get to their destination.

{"text": "Trump\u2019s executive order on religious freedom allows HHS Secretary Tom Price to cut access to affordable contraceptive services from their health insurance plans.\nThe subject line of the press release from HHS Secretary Tom Price in response to President Trump\u2019s signing of the Religious Liberty executive order said it all, \u201cSecretary Price Welcomes Opportunity to Reexamine Contraception Mandate\u201d. The executive order frees Price to take aim at covered women\u2019s health services that providers, insurers, and employers may find objectionable under their religious beliefs. Price has an antiquated and paternalistic perspective that men should be in charge of the type of health care services a woman have access to.\nConscience Protections with Respect to Preventive-Care Mandate. The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consider issuing amended regulations, consistent with applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate promulgated under section 300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42, United States Code.\nReligious liberty is our country\u2019s first freedom. Americans of faith play a vital role in caring for our most vulnerable citizens, including the elderly and the poor.\nWe welcome today\u2019s executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services to reexamine the previous administration\u2019s interpretation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s preventive services mandate, and commend President Trump for taking a strong stand for religious liberty.\nWe will be taking action in short order to follow the President\u2019s instruction to safeguard the deeply held religious beliefs of Americans who provide health insurance to their employees.\nSecretary Price will not be happy until he has been able to strip away all coverage for women\u2019s health issues. The man seems to have stepped out of the 18th century when women had no control over their bodies. He certainly would have been in favor of eugenics and the 1927 Supreme Court decision in Buck v. Bell that upheld a state\u2019s right to permit compulsory sterilization of women deemed unfit to bear children.\nIn addition to taking the ax to the contraception mandate, Price expressed glee over the House of Representative\u2019s vote to repeal the ACA.\nThe status quo is failing the American people. Premiums are skyrocketing; choices are narrowing or vanishing; and patients do not have access to the care they need. Today, the House of Representatives has begun to deliver on President Trump\u2019s promise to repeal a broken law and replace it with solutions that put patients in charge. This is a victory for the American people.\nThe American Health Care Act is focused on patients. It is the first step toward a patient-centered healthcare system that will provide Americans access to quality, affordable healthcare coverage, empowering individuals and families to choose the coverage that best meets their needs, not what Washington forces them to buy, and equipping states to address the diverse needs of their most vulnerable populations. As Congress continues its work, the team at HHS will continue to support the reform effort by reviewing and initiating administrative actions to put patients, families and doctors in charge of medical decisions, bring down costs, and increase choices.\nThe American Health Care Act (AHCA) passed by the House allows states to file for waivers and allow health plans to exclude some or all of the essential health benefits under the current rulings. Price will almost certainly grant any waiver that strips women\u2019s health services from being offered in health plans. But his rational for allowing states to address \u201cthe diverse needs of their most vulnerable populations\u201d is fundamentally flawed. The Republicans have been promoting the idea that people in different states have different health care concerns. Therefore, states should be free to include or exclude certain services.\nThe health care needs of people are not dependent on what state you live in. A pregnant woman in Alabama requires the same pre-natal and other maternity health care services as a woman in California. The argument that somehow a person\u2019s health care needs change based on what state they live is tantamount to saying that people in Detroit should be fine with drinking lead-tainted water, but people in Texas shouldn\u2019t have to. All people should have access to clean drinking water because they are humans. All people should have access to the same health care services because they are humans regardless of what state they live in.\nThe other part of the AHCA is that it denies funding to Planned Parenthood. This means that women will have fewer providers to choose from if it passes the Senate and is signed by Trump. It has been Price\u2019s contention that the AHCA will expand access to care. But when the legislation removes hundreds of doctors who have been the primary care physician for thousands of women, how is that improving access to care?\nIt has become a tired phrase, but Price and his Republican-Christian-Conservative brethren put profits over people. Their ideas on the egalitarian nature of health care are that it should only be extended to healthy people who follow their holy scriptures. All others are unworthy of receiving affordable health insurance and decent health care. These people are just warped, stuck in their own little bubble world.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T17:47:42Z", "url": "https://insuremekevin.com/hhs-secretary-takes-aim-at-womens-health-care-services/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "A probation violation can occur in a number of different ways.\nViolations can come from positive urinalysis.\nThey can come from being out after curfew.\nViolations come whenever a special condition or a standard condition of probation are breached.\nSpecial conditions are those conditions that are specifically laid out and are unique to that term of probation. Whereas, standard conditions are those conditions that are standard with every term of probation.\nAn example of a standard term of probation is not to commit a new criminal offense.\nAn example of a special term of probation is to complete a drug evaluation and treatment.\nWhat is the legal standard to a probation violation?\nIn order to violate probation, a probationer must willfully and substantially violate the terms of their probation.\nIn other words, you can\u2019t accidentally have a probation violation. Also, you can\u2019t violate probation because of an inability to complete an item of probation (despite your best efforts).

{"text": "This month some important Walmart news did not get the attention it deserved. The news wasn't some flashy announcement about virtual reality or about some new service for busy Manhattanites. It was something much more subtle and much more substantive.\nIt was the hire of Valerie Casey. Google \"Valerie Casey\" even today and only two listings make mention of her newfound connection with Walmart on the first page of the returned search results. This amount of attention is unjustifiably slight. Let this piece then serve as the hire's coming out party.\nShrewdly, Walmart has made Valerie Casey, formerly of Frog, Ideo, and Pentagram, its new head of design. She will be charged with leading Walmart into the future and ensuring that all its products and services, from websites to employee and consumer apps, will work in cohesion and from a singular experience design point of view.\n\"What's the big whup?\" you might ask.\nThe big whup is that this announcement clearly shows that Walmart has jumped feet first into the waters of next generation retailing. Under Doug McMillon's bold leadership, Walmart here again is taking one of the most essential steps to long-term success for any legacy bricks-and-mortar retailer\u2014specifically, redefining how it thinks of the word \"product.\"\nInstead of doing what many retailers do, like staffing de facto \"product\" heads within owned brand development, store operations, e-commerce, etc. and then leaving them to collaborate inside complex organizations with competing priorities, Walmart rightly understands that retailing has become so complex that all these aforementioned roles now need their own steward to ensure alignment.\nWalmart having a mission to help its customers save money and live better is one thing, but putting that promise into coherent action is another thing entirely. Many retailers take such coordinated action for granted, which is why so many legacy retail experiences feel disjointed across the digital and physical divide. Success rarely is found in the compromise and turf wars of internal politics. The buck needs to stop somewhere.\nPrior to e-commerce, before customers had the myriad of options they have today to consume products (via web portals, apps, social media, etc.), retailers were able to differentiate themselves by the products inside their four walls. The strategic practice of product differentiation became so prevalent and such a point of emphasis that it even gave way to the commonly heard parlance of retail being a \"merchant-led business.\"\nThe growth of e-commerce in the 1990s and 2000s rewrote the playbook though. During this period, Jeff Bezos built Amazon into the \"Everything Store.\" His idea was that as long as he could offer a great selection, convenience and great prices, consumers would gravitate towards Amazon over time. Boy, was he right, and, boy, did they ever gravitate towards Amazon.\nWhether customers try to order direct from Amazon or from one of Amazon's many third-party suppliers on its marketplace, it is becoming more and more difficult for a consumer not to find what he or she desires on Amazon. At this point, nearly 50% of all first product searches start on Amazon, indicating that Amazon is settling into the digital and product acquisition-equivalent of the 1980s shopping mall. The products inside a retailers four walls or within a retailers assortment are now, in a way, almost non-differentiating.\nBezos saw that the opportunity in retail was to put the customer first and to think not about the product he or she buys but about the Product he or she really buys\u2014for him, the Product (big \"P) of the Amazon brand. The white space in retail was no longer leading with product (small \"p\"), but leading with the discipline of Product Management, where his Product, or in this case, the Amazon brand, was the magic created at the intersection of great experience design, technology and business. Product was not a pair of khaki pants, a new set of bed sheets or a bar of soap. It was the culmination of a friction-free user experience that delivered on the universal truths of selection, convenience, and low prices and that exceeded consumers' expectations consistently, again and again.\nSadly, many retailers have not grasped this \"Product Problem.\" The greatest Product Manager in history, Jeff Bezos, saw the problem early on, while many merchant princes missed the signals and have even now admitted that they underestimated the impact technology would have on retail. Fortunately, Walmart's recent hire of Casey indicates that there could be light at the end of what has, until now, been a dark tunnel.\nWalmart is big. The acquisitions of Jet.com, Bonobos, ModCloth, etc. have only made it bigger and more complex, saying nothing too of the ever-changing demands of consumers and Walmart's ever-expanding interests abroad (see Flipkart). Therefore, it is only right that someone, like Casey, take up the mantle to oversee and to fight for the consumer and to ensure that all Walmart's activities look, feel, and convey the Walmart brand in the simplest, most straightforward way as possible.\nThe products inside Walmart's stores are immaterial to its future success. What matters is the Product of its brand\u2014its website, its store, its app-based services, etc. Those are the Products that matter. In a future world where the only thing that differentiates a physical from a digital experience is the memory and delight of being somewhere, a Walmart store is the Product or collective set of experiences that will get someone off his or her couch.\nA tube of toothpaste just won't cut it anymore.\nWhile the products within Walmart's store or on its website will come and go and ebb and flow, the shroud of the Walmart brand will be what matters. Walmart's store and its digital properties will be the envelopes that carry its brand promise.\nThe experiment that bears this out has already been run. We need look no further than the history of Amazon and also to the young upstart CEOs like Emily Weiss, Katrina Lake and Adam Goldenberg who are already thriving in this new world. Their collective early success indicates that they get the punchline to the joke of 21st century retail\u2014that the retail of the future won't be merchant led, it will be Product led.\nBest of luck, Valerie Casey. A bricks-and-mortar nation turns its lonely eyes to you.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T16:48:47Z", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2018/06/30/walmart-made-an-incredibly-sharp-move-this-month-hiring-valerie-casey/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "University of Utah track and field athlete Lauren McCluskey was found shot dead Monday night in the backseat of a vehicle outside a campus dormitory, according to university police. The suspected shooter was 37-year-old Melvin Rowland, a man McCluskey\u2019s family said she had recently stopped dating. Rowland\u2019s body was found a few hours later at a church; police said he died by suicide.\nAt a press conference, university police chief Dale Brophy said that McCluskey had filed a police report with them \u201con Oct. 12 and Oct. 13\u201d about threats from Rowland. There was \u201csome follow-up\u201d and it was assigned to a detective who was \u201cworking to build a case against our suspect at that time,\u201d Brophy said. The police chief would not go into further details about what happened with that investigation.\nOn Monday night, Brophy said that police got a call from a frantic mother saying \u201csomething happened to her daughter.\u201d In a statement released by the McCluskey family, McCluskey\u2019s mother said that she was on the phone with her daughter that night when she suddenly heard Lauren McCluskey yell \u201cno no no!\u201d Afraid her daughter was in a car accident, she stayed on the line while her husband called 911. A few minutes later, the family statement said, \u201ca young woman picked up the phone and said all of Lauren\u2019s things were on the ground.\u201d It was the last time she spoke with her daughter.\nPolice officers went to the parking lot and found McCluskey\u2019s body, Brophy said. The university issued an alert and an order for students to \u201csecure-in-place.\u201d It was lifted at 11:46 p.m., according to the university\u2019s website, after police determined that Rowland was no longer on campus. Brophy said that Rowland was picked up by a vehicle and, about 1:15 a.m. he was spotted by Salt Lake City police who ran after him. Rowland got inside the Trinity AME Church, where he killed himself. A retired pastor told the Salt Lake Tribune that, to the best of his knowledge, Rowland didn\u2019t attend the church and he had no idea why he chose that building.\nThe family of McCluskey, 21, said that their daughter had dated Rowland for about a month. She ended the relationship after she learned about his criminal history.\nLauren was a senior student athlete on the University of Utah track team. She was an outstanding student with a 3.75 GPA majoring in Communication and was excited to graduate in May 2019. She was a 2015 honors graduate of Pullman High School where she was Washington state champion in the high jump and the school record holder in the 100 meter hurdles. She attended Capital Church in Salt Lake City. She loved to sing and had strength and determination. She was dearly loved and will be greatly missed.\nPolice said the two had been in a \u201cprior relationship,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t comment further. According to Utah Department of Corrections, Rowland was convicted in 2004 of enticing a minor, a second-degree felony, and attempted forcible sexual abuse, a third-degree felony.

{"text": "Gimme S'more - A School Superintendent's thoughts on education, community, parenting, and more.\nWhat can make a hippopotamus smile? What can make him walk more than a mile? It's not a party with paper hats or a case of candy that makes him fat, THAT\u2019S NOT WHAT HIPPOS DO! Nooooo. They, ooze through the gooze without any shoes, they wade through the water till' their lips turn blue, that\u2019s what hippos do!\nJust in case you were wondering what makes a hippo smile, right?\nBefore you jump to the conclusion that I have lost my mind, let me explain. For some, the introductory lines of this blog will ring familiar. They are the lyrics to one of many songs that will echo through acres of forests, hillsides, and riverbanks during the months of June, July and August. These songs will be sung by a passionate army of young children who, along with their mentors and idols, will be participating in a ritual cherished by the inner child in so many of us--SLEEPAWAY CAMP!\nIt\u2019s February, which means families across the country are securing their spots at one of over 8,400 U.S. sleepaway camps and over 5,600 certified day camps. Have you reserved your spot yet? If not, let me explain why I think you should.\nAs a parent of three and a former camper, camp counselor, and camp director, I cannot impress upon parents enough the meaningful impact summer camp can have on children. In my parent education classes, I often refer to sleepaway camp as the single most important and impactful experience a parent can provide their child. For most children, sleepaway camp develops the skills and mindsets parents so earnestly want to impart upon their children and does so in ways that we parents are sometimes unable to do. So why am I such a passionate advocate for sleepaway camp?\nIt\u2019s easy for a parent to forget that our number one responsibility is to prepare our children to LEAVE US. It\u2019s counterintuitive, really. We spend so much of our lives connecting with these little beings that grow up so quickly. We offer them all we have. In them, we place our hopes, dreams, and aspirations. Only to have them roll their eyes when we perse our lips for a kiss as they leave the car and say, \u201cGross, mom. My friends will see. Ugh!\u201d As our kids grow older they need us less. And they should. If you want to measure your success as a parent (and I don\u2019t necessarily recommend that you do), consider how well you are preparing your children to leave you.\nSleepaway camp is the single most important resource that I have found that helps prepare our children for healthy individuation. Individuation is a psychological term (coined by Carl Jung) that describes the process of self-actualization. In basic terms, a child\u2019s individuation begins when he/she starts to see him/herself as separate from the parent. As much as we might not feel comfortable with the idea of our child separating more from us, it is an essential part of the process of a child becoming a healthy adult. At sleepaway camp, our children are given the opportunity to see themselves through a lens separate from their parents. The very nature of spending several days and nights without parents in a safe and controlled environment allows children to expand their view of themselves in relationship to the world around them. Their identities away from us are allowed space to grow.\nOf all of the gifts sleepaway camp provides us parents, it\u2019s personal responsibility and independence that are often the most gratifying. After years as a camp counselor and director, the response I most often heard from parents after their children returned from camp was appreciation that their child was helping out more around the house. Parents would comment that they didn\u2019t have to ask their child to take their dishes to the sink, rinse them off, and put them in the dishwasher...it just happened! Parents were shocked to find their child had actually made their bed in the morning.\nAt most sleepaway camps (and if this is NOT the case for your child\u2019s camp, I would encourage you to find another one), personal responsibility is the cornerstone of daily life. Daily chore charts that require every camper to participate include jobs like: wait the tables in the dining hall, wash dishes, deliver mail, vacuum, collect and empty garbage, etc. At many camps, the kids are responsible for cleaning their own bathrooms. YES, even toilets. My favorite job to be assigned was \u201csuper spatula.\u201d This job entails scraping all of the food off of the plates at mealtime onto one main plate and then transferring the \u201cORT\u201d (or leftover food morsels) to the \u201cort bucket,\u201d the contents of which would be fed to the pigs at the camp\u2019s farm.\nOur children can be forgiven for thinking that the world they live in is universal. After all, many of our children haven\u2019t had the opportunity to see much of the world during their young years. Sleepaway camp, particularly those that attempt to attract children and staff from different cities, regions, and backgrounds, provide our children with new and unique experiences and the opportunity to navigate and negotiate social situations that involve people who are different from them and the friends they interact with every day. Often, many sleepaway camps will hire staff from one of several international staffing agencies, thus diversifying the experience even more. Camp program staff design clinics, courses, and experiences that are likely to be novel for the campers, thus expanding a camper\u2019s view on what he/she might enjoy or be good at. I have had the good fortune of observing scores of campers find new hobbies, interest, and passions from just one experience at camp. I know campers who have become chefs from having participated in outdoor cooking classes or children who have become veterinarians as a result of attending horse/ranch camp.\nWith peers: Ask any adult who has spent time as a camper or staff at a summer camp and they will most likely have close friends today that they met at camp, as well as an army of others that may not be as close, but whose sleepaway camp bond keeps them connected for a lifetime. Children learn not only how to build and maintain relationships with peers, but they also learn the VALUE of deep, supportive friendships. Especially as kids get older, I find that they appreciate having a world outside of school where friends \u201caccept them for who they are.\u201d At camp, children are able to let go of so much more of the pressures of \u201cfitting in\u201d and \u201cmeasuring up\u201d because they are in a new space. Not to mention, most sleepaway camps provide a technology-free environment for children to cultivate friendship the old-fashioned way--through conversation and shared experience--NOT through social media.\nWith non-parent adults: In an age when the pressures and distractions our children face are only increasing, one of the best defenses against childhood and teen depression, anxiety, and self-harm is a supportive adult outside the family that your child knows they can turn to. In school settings we ensure that each child has at least one adult on campus they know they can talk to, and a camp experience widens the net of available confidantes for our children. As our kids individuate, their bonds with other adults become more important. They will value and look up to role models they trust, and those trusted adults become part of the village that helps raise our children. As a \u201cretired\u201d counselor, I can\u2019t tell you how many now-grown campers still reach out to me for support, advice, or just a friendly and non-judgmental ear. It is a privilege for me to me held in that esteem, but also a helpful relationship for them as they navigate their way through young adulthood. I know the counselors whom I most respected held that role for me and my life is better for it.\nWith YOU: Before you worry that sending your child off to meet and bond with other adults will diminish your own relationship, fear not. Consider that a child whose parents trust them enough to 1) send them to camp and 2) encourage them to seek mentorship outside the parental relationship feels valued and supported, and will actually respect you more for that freedom. I find that as children grow up, the parents with whom they feel closest are the ones who have learned to loosen the strings appropriately. We want the best for our kids, and helping them grow a network of close adults who can provide advice and support is one of the greatest gifts we can give them. Believe me, they will not forget about you \u2013 they will love you for the experience!\nWhen I was a child, my friends and I were free to ride our bikes to the far ends of the earth (or at least that what it felt like) to discover our own adventures. We explored the outdoors with a lightness and whimsy that is often frowned upon today. Even though our neighborhoods are much safer than they have ever been, providing the freedom for children to explore the great outdoors feels too risky a venture for most parents. And even if we did provide that freedom, the draw of technology or the scheduling of numerous sports and activities has our children indoors and/or booked most of the time.\nSleepaway camp is a ticket outdoors without the worry of putting children\u2019s safety at risk.\nYou don\u2019t need me to remind you of the myriad of benefits being outdoors has on our health and wellbeing. There\u2019s plenty of great research out there to tell you that being outdoors can do wonders to your body, mind, and spirit. However, maybe we all need to be reminded that our children need it, too. Desperately. And if you are like me and live in the middle of massive suburbia with all of its pressure, stress, noise, and competing interests, then we share an even greater need to get out in the great outdoors. Sleepaway camp provides this necessary connection to the natural world for our children.\nBelow is a graphic published by the American Camp Association that highlights some of the benefits campers, parents, and staff experience from camp.\nI imagine that all this sleepaway camp talk has got you wondering a few things. Let me take a stab at answering the most likely questions you may have.\nI am also a big supporter of day camps. In fact my own children attend several day camps in our area and love them. There are so many great options with specific sports, music, art or hobby foci. There are also more globally focused camps that try to address the teaching of innovation, adventure, or making skills. Day camps are a gradual entre to sleepaway camp, too. All that said, there is some developmental growth and experience that only sleepaway camp can provide. In my book, including at least one week of sleepaway camp in the summer plans, along with a smattering of day camps and family time is a great recipe for summer growth and respite.\nHow do I know my child is ready for sleepaway camp?\nBegin with day camp experiences at least one year before signing up for sleepaway camp.\nIf possible, select a sleepaway camp that is near to your home when your child is younger. For those in the Bay Area, there are many options in the Santa Cruz Mountains and surrounding areas.\nA one-week session is usually the perfect starting point for a new sleepaway camper.\nStart talking about sleepaway camp early. My children hear about my sleepaway camp experiences all the time. Last summer we visited my former sleepaway camp in preparation for one of my children to begin this summer. He has been talking about starting ever since we visited.\nAttend a family camp at your favorite sleepaway facility. Most camps properties provide family camp options during the off season. These are great opportunities to acclimate your children to sleepaway camp.\nWhat are indicators of quality?\nI\u2019m going likely disappoint a lot of people by not recommending any specific camp. It\u2019s not my job to presuppose a family\u2019s needs and values; I also don\u2019t want to leave any quality program out of my recommendations. That said, there are some great resources out there to help you identify a great camp for your child.\nFirst get recommendations from people you trust. There is no better indicator of quality than the recommendation of friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Second, you want to make sure that the camp you choose is accredited. Accreditation ensures that camps have the proper facility maintenance, staff training and support, safety plans and measures, and philosophical approach. The American Camp Association is the largest accreditation organizations in the U.S., but there are others. To ensure that the camp is a right fit, you can also read online reviews and take a visit. Camps welcome parent visitors to their facilities to discover more; take them up on that welcome.\nSending your child to camp, especially the first time, with a friend is a great way to ease the anxiety that they--or more likely, you--have about being away from home for an extended period. Homesickness is real for many kids, even the most well adjusted and outgoing. Attending with a friend can help create just enough comfort, allowing kids, especially the younger ones, to adjust quickly to being away from home. Often, after the first experience with a friend, the childhood fears dissipate greatly. While attending with a friend is a great strategy, I do recommend providing at least occasional camp options that don\u2019t always include the same group of kids your children hang out with at school or in sports/scouts/church, etc. Having an experience that challenges children to get out of their comfort zones is valuable; attending sleepaway camp with a team and coach they are always with is great, but there is growth in providing experiences with children and staff with whom a camper is unfamiliar.\nWhat if I can\u2019t afford camp?\nMany camps offer financial aid and scholarships, as well as discounts. If you are interested in sending your child to sleepaway camp, but worry about the cost, contact the camp you\u2019re interested in attending and ask about financial assistance. Another strategy for managing costs is to get your child excited about sleepaway camp and use earning money toward camp as an incentive or a substitute for expensive gifts at birthday and holiday times. Having a birthday party? Instead of receiving a dozen toys as gifts that will get broken and lost within two weeks, ask folks to donate to your child\u2019s sleepaway camp fund. Many faith-based organizations and local community groups also sponsor summer camp experiences that are low or no cost. If you have the will to send your child to sleepaway camp, there are ways to make it happen.\nAll this talk about camp makes me nostalgic for my camp days. Nature hikes, horseback rides, all-camp capture the flag, campouts under the stars, the sounds of a dozen hammers pounding leather, S\u2019mores and camp songs by the campfire as fireflies light up the night sky. I\u2019m not sure what can make a hippopotamus smile, but I am sure there\u2019s nothing like belting the song out at the top of my lungs with new and lifelong friends.\nIf my words have piqued your interest, you might want to sign your child up soon. Spots often fill up in January and February for the summer at most of the best sleepaway camps. Give your camp a call today and feel free to let me know how it goes once the summer wraps up.\nWhat can make a hippopotamus smile? What can make him walk more than a mile? It\u2019s not a tune on the old violin, or listenin\u2019 to the whistlin\u2019 wind. THAT\u2019S NOT WHAT HIPPO'S DO! Noooo.

At WMS he was originally based in the Institute of Clinical Leadership, which ran programmes in medical leadership for undergraduate and postgraduate doctors. The Institute also offered development programmes for newly qualified doctors and developed a Certificate and Masters programme in Medical Leadership.Peter was Project Director for five years on the Enhancing Engagement in Medical Leadership project, run jointly by the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. This project produced the Medical Leadership Competency Framework (MLCF), now endorsed by the General Medical Council as part of undergraduate and postgraduate training. It also formed the basis of a modified Clinical Leadership Competency Framework for all clinical professionals and ultimately the Leadership Framework for all NHS staff groups.The project also produced the Medical Engagement Scale (MES), which provides a metric of the level of engagement of the medical workforce in the wider goals of the organisation. Peter has overseen the subsequent use of this measure to its current position of an international comparative database of some 7000 doctors.

{"text": "In fact, there are currently over a million international students studying in the United States. India and China are by far the two largest contributors, with 47% of all students for the 2015-2016 school year.\nThe visa application process can be confusing though, especially when English isn\u2019t your strong suit. We at TransparentCareer have laid out each type of visa used by international students, and the application process for each visa.\nF1 Visa\u2013 These are the most common type of visas, and are used for bachelor and graduate school degrees, as well as training programs in the English language. The first step is to check whether the university you\u2019re interested in is verified by the United States government \u2013 you can\u2019t get an F1 visa for non accredited universities. Take a look here to see if your school is verified. The first step is to apply to universities where you want to study. Upon acceptance, the university will provide you with a form I-20. Keep in mind \u2013 you can\u2019t transfer once you select a school. Make sure it\u2019s the right fit for you! You\u2019ll then have to go to the site of the US embassy closest to you, and pay a non refundable application fee. Find the embassy closest to you here.\nYou\u2019ll then have to prepare for an interview \u2013 the sooner you can set this up the better. The interviewer will require proof of intent to return to your country after you complete your education (such as family, home job offer) as well as a passport and the form I-20 provided by your school. The interview will also require proof of financial sufficiency to fund your education. If you need advice on how to finance your education, take a look at this guide. Depending on your school you may also have to provide test scores such as the SAT, GMAT, or GRE.\nJ1A Visa\u2013 J1A visas are for those looking to temporarily stay in the US for a work or culture exchange program, such as to be an au pair, international camp counselor, or for specific medical training. To be accepted, you have to be sponsored by a nonprofit or government organization. You can find a list of all approved organizations here. After applying and being approved by an organization, they\u2019ll provide you with a DS-2019 form to fill out. Then you have to apply for a J1A visa at your nearest US embassy. A Sevis I-901 fee must then be paid (sometimes by your sponsor), along with a Nonimmigrant Application Processing Fee of $160. You must then schedule an appointment with the embassy, giving plenty of time in case anything goes wrong. Bring along the DS-2019 form provided by your sponsor, as well as your passport, a 2\u00d72 photo, and any additional documentation that may be required depending on the nature of your program. You can find the types of documentation on the J1A government site.\nM1A Visa\u2013 This is visa for vocational training in the US. There must be a specific program/school when you apply for the visa, and you\u2019ll have certain requirements and forms you might have to fill out for the school before applying for a visa. You aren\u2019t allowed to work while studying in the US, so you must prove to the school that you have enough money to stay in the US while getting your training. If approved by the school, they\u2019ll give you a form I-20 to fill out, which you\u2019ll need next when you set up a meeting at your nearest US Embassy. You\u2019ll also have to pay an application fee, and bring your passport, a photo (with rules provided by your consulate), a DS-160 form, and a DS-157 form if you\u2019re a male between the ages of 16 and 45.\nH1B Visa- H1B work visas are for those that have completed a higher form of education and want to work in America \u2013 it\u2019s the most common way for foreign students to stay and work in the US after graduation. These visas have to be filed by your employer, so if you\u2019re hoping to stay in America after graduation you should start the job search as soon as possible. Approvals are done through a lottery system, and start to fill up quickly after the government\u2019s fiscal year starts \u2013 typically October 1. You may file up to 6 months in advance, so filing as close to April 1 as possible is ideal. There are a total of 85,000 visas issued this way each year, and the first 20,000 are reserved for those with master\u2019s degrees or higher levels of education. The remaining 65,000 are available to those with bachelor\u2019s degrees, along with those that didn\u2019t make it past the first round with a master\u2019s or higher level of education.\nA lot of controversy has stirred up around H1B visas recently after the election of Donald Trump, who has claimed on numerous occasions that he wants to get rid of people who got into the US unfairly. According to Forbes, the top 10 companies that sponsor H1B visas received 25,000 visas in 2014, which is nearly 30% of all issued H1B visas. Of these 10 firms, half were firms based in India, typically working with call centers. Trump and others supportive of a crackdown claim that firms are submitting multiple applications for one person in order to game the system. 236,000 applications were received last year for the 85,000 positions, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there were 236,000 applicants. While we haven\u2019t seen what a Trump presidency will look like yet, stopping people from abusing the system may provide more opportunities for foreign students looking to work in the US after graduation.\nCheck out our industry career guides on Finance, Consulting, and Tech to help you decide which is the best fit for you.\nLooking to stay in the states after graduation?

Instagram is being used more for the Photo contest and social media campaigns these days. Even I have seen few images which I am sure it is not clicked by mobile camera, but they upload it by third-party applications uploading directly from the computer. Apart from that, you can even search in Instagram or know the stats of the users using the service.\nHow can you use Instagram on your PC?\nGramfeed: gives an interactive Instagram UI which helps you to manage your friends photos likes and check out familiar photos which are active. It also shows the maps which helps to know from where the photo is being clicked. It provides you grid view if you want to see the photos in one go or you can select it in normal view which helps you to check out the photos with time format.\nInk361: is another Instagram third-party service, which helps you to give the full view of the photos uploaded by other users like you see in Instagram. Ink361 shows their ad in between of other images which irritates using the service sometimes as Instagram does not provide any ad placement on mobile service. The geo tagging feature is more useful than Gramfeed.\nRelated Post: Learning from Red Bull Stratos \u2013 How to create Buzz!\nInstagram for Chrome: this one is the best browser based application which gives the exact feel of using Instagram on the mobile.

If you receive a letter informing you that you have jury duty, you have to show up at the court on the appointed date, where you will sit in a \"juror pool,\" waiting to be called into court for an upcoming trial. During the jury selection procedure, you may be eliminated as a possible juror, at which point, your service is complete. If you end up on the jury, you must show up every day for the trial, or risk being held in contempt of court.\nFiling a Lawsuit: When you decide that you need to sue someone in Sheridan, Arkansas civil court, it goes without saying that you're going to spend a lot of time dealing with the judicial system. Even if your case doesn't go to trial (and, statistically, it probably won't), the proceedings can drag on for months. Settlement conferences, disagreements over discovery, and many other issues not directly related to the merits of your lawsuit are going to be overseen by the Sheridan, Arkansas court.\nBeing Sued: Likewise, if you're the defendant in a lawsuit, you're going to have a lot of work to do in Sheridan, Arkansas's courts.

{"text": "Dayton WordCamp | The Jamestown Comet.\nSome people are of the mind that there is a certain age when learning something new is neither a priority nor even a possibility. As I approach a half-century on this earth, I have a hard time wrapping my head around the idea that, at some point, people just stop learning.\nBarring some kind of dementia or other mental disorder, it\u2019s hard to understand why anyone would \u201cchoose\u201d to be an old dog, totally uninterested in learning a new trick. In my lines of work, I am frequently exposed to innovative technology and new ideas and I\u2019m expected to keep up or I don\u2019t pay the mortgage.\nI spend a considerable amount of time researching, learning new concepts or updating my skills in some way so I can stay relevant in a world that seems to change by the nanosecond. Part of that continuing education includes reading, networking with others and going to conferences and workshops. I just returned from one such conference that was, for me, one of the single best I have ever attended.\nA couple of months ago, I was asked by a friend to speak at an upcoming technology event known as, \u201cDayton WordCamp,\u201d a two-day series focused on the website content management system called \u201cWordPress.\u201d As with most tech, this event would be dominated by much younger, more advanced presenters.\nOriginally, I hesitated, feeling as if \u201cat my age\u201d (and technical level) I would have little to bring to the table. But, with a little effort I found a spot where I fit into the program nicely and agreed.\nDayton\u2019s event is one of hundreds of WordCamps around the world, all presented for the benefit of those using WordPress as their website platform. Lovingly referred to by organizers as an \u201cunconference,\u201d the atmosphere is very relaxed and laid back, with most people wearing jeans and T-shirts. One of the perks of speaking is the opportunity to attend the event as a spectator as well.\nOne of the first things I noticed upon arrival was that I was not the oldest person in the room. Of roughly 120 attendees the bell curve probably favored the younger crowd, but there were plenty of people my age and older as well. Such diversity says something for both the reputations of the scheduled presenters and the usability of the software about which we had all come to learn.\nAs the first day\u2019s session began my apprehension diminished and I began to settle into a comfortable atmosphere for learning. By the conclusion of day two, I was not only charged up to dive in and apply my newly-acquired information, but I wanted to find a way to be more involved in future sessions.\nAt this point, I have to give a shout out to my friend Dustin Hartzler and his fellow organizers, particularly Nathan Driver, who invited me to speak at the event while also allowing me to be a student as well (that\u2019s not the norm at such functions). These folks gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge, allowing me to better serve my clients, plus I got to take a couple of days for myself, something for which I rarely have the opportunity.\nIn my experience, most people who have stopped learning have done so, in some manner, by choice. Learning is not just academic. Expanding your horizons at any age is not limited to taking college classes or immersing yourself in books for hours on end. You can attend free, hands-on workshops, watch \u201cdo it yourself\u201d shows on television, or just dive in and try something on your own, learning as you go.\nMy point is that there is simply no reason any of us should be stagnant. Opportunities for growth exist in many areas of our lives and all we need to do is take the first step. What is important is that you get out there and try, whether your interest is gardening, motorcycles, computers, music, or maybe you want to try something new. Don\u2019t be an old dog with no new tricks.\nGery L. Deer is an independent columnist and business writer.

{"text": "HOW did they sneak this through?? I thought they said they wouldn't!!\nWe don't have emoticons angry enough to express how I feel.\nHardly anything in the news about it...this was the article that came up first when I did a search.\nIt was reported on our local news channel too, the suggestion was that the drilling site equipment would not be sited on any protected land, but the shale gas would be extracted by using pipes laid underground to get to it. I doubt the exploration drilling site will do anything to complement the beautiful countryside views, another eyesore to put up with. I have my reservations about this whole process, there has to be some risk ( even if it's very low) when you are injecting those sort of materials underground to release the gas, what happens to the sand, chemicals and water then? Does it permeate the rock changing it's chemical composition, seep into water courses or add pollution to the atmosphere? Quite scary and all for the sake of getting our own gas (if it can be recovered)for the future - at what price?\nI was sent a petition to sign in January, being run by Greenpeace but I don't remember seeing anything from 38 Degrees separately. Added just found this, I assume it's still relevant? speakout.38degrees.org.uk/campaigns/fracking-keep-your-promise Just signed it and it was accepted.\nFor me, the jury is still out with regards to fracking. I'm not totally against the proposals but 38 Degrees is a revelation - never heard of it before, I obviously lead a very sheltered life! So thank you for that.\nI agree with you, Shirl, about not having decided absolutely about the harm that might be done by fracking, but what does worry me is that it is yet more reliance on fossil fuels, when we are supposed to be committed to renewable energy. This is what makes me feel that big business is bound to be behind it. Thanks for alerting me to the petition \u2013 it's probable that I signed that one a while ago, but it needs to be said again. I have emailed them to say so. i also feel strongly that protected areas should stay protected.\nAlf, I am so glad you have been alerted to 38 Degrees (and do you know Avaaz, for the international equivalent?). It is a way of getting the voice of sensible, reasonable, concerned people (that's us, of course!) heard, as opposed to the government and business (much the same thing, at the present time) having it all its own way.\nI thought they said they wouldn't!!\nI have just read in New Scientist that senior environmentalists believe that fracking is the best option we have at the moment. Yes, it is a fossil fuel, but for reasons I don't pretend to understand, it is apparently far and away the best, until really effective solar power etc is produced. Here's an article in the Guardian about it www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/08/shale-gas-fracking-good-for-environment. But I'm still not at all sure that it should go on in national parks \u2013 they say that it produces quite an upheaval getting started. On the other hand, so do wind farms. No easy answers here.\nThe guardian article makes interesting reading and I have to say, the more I read, hear and think about this, the more accepting I am of fracking being a viable, and possibly the only, way forward given the demands of our society for energy. No body wants to see a drilling rig from their home any more than people wanted to see coal pits, slag heaps, gasometers, power stations, electricity pylons, etc in the past. There is a tremendous vitriolic outpouring around here whenever a farmer wants planning permission for a solitary wind turbine on his land so the opposition to fracking drilling rigs will be phenomenal! But, if we continue to demand the kind of lifestyles we enjoy now we need to learn to live with a few blots on the landscape especially if the blots provide the energy we crave along with a reduction in pollution and global warming. In the short term, fracking may be part of the answer.\nAny predictions about the long-term effects of fracking on the geology? of the surrounding areas can be nothing more than guesses.\nLooks like the regulator in this news item concluded that fracking operations did cause a magnitude 4.6 earthquake, but experts suggest that any fracking related future earthquakes are unlikely to cause any damage - are we confident in that statement or is it just that no damage has been seen to occur so far so that's evidence enough!\nThe latest thing I heard on the radio from a geology professor, who sounded a strong conservationist, was that damage had indeed been done by frackers in America but it was because they were cowboys after a quick buck and did things all wrong, and that sort of thing (earthquakes, contaminated water supplies etc.) was preventable if proper safeguards were in place. His opinion was that there is no way of getting energy that is without some drawback or other, but that fracking was a good candidate for being not as bad as most.\nDon't believe all you read about us, Yetis are NOT vegetarians: we love steak and chips.\nVery good and well made post Alf.\nI am an energy user, as is everyone here on this Forum. I want far better sourced energy and in time, I think that will happen. But I feel it will take decades or even centuries to get to a true 100% renewable/green sources. In the meantime I cannot see us going forward as a civilisation without at least very, very carefully testing the viability and environmental impact of such as fracking as a \"temporary\" source of energy.\nIf it passes such tests and can be done under National Parks with minimal and very strictly controlled pollution etc on the edges/just outside of the Parks, then so be it.\nAnd does that mean I would accept such as a drilling rig in the eye line looking up to the lovely North Downs, I live in sight of here in Kent? Not a National Park, but still very lovely, then the answer is a qualified Yes.\nDid anyone see the PBS America programme about fracking - it was shown a couple of times in the past week. Seems that there is little regulation for such activity in parts of US with result that well heads have been sited next to homes, schools and playgrounds - apparently allowed within 350ft (a study suggests it should be x7 that distance). There are 18,000 well heads in Colorado alone. Lots of companies have jumped on this bandwagon with no regard for the local population or environment. Earth tremors have been linked to inappropriate disposal of waste water underground and substandard lining of wells has allowed escape of gases into the environment.\nI'm still not totally against fracking but I sure hope it will be better controlled her than in the US.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T02:41:11Z", "url": "http://wildaboutthebritishisles.uk/thread/787/fracking-given-ahead-national-parks", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek.\nIn his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8.\nAs long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the \"Coming in 3.8\" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8.\nIn Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support.\nVersion 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's Tegra\u00c2 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube.\nThe Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months. The developers have also included a workaround for a bug in the Intel 830 and 845 chipsets so the graphics drivers are supposed to be stable on these chipsets.\nThe virtio_net network driver, which uses paravirtualisation and is especially used with KVM and Xen, should provide better performance now that it can use multiple queues for each network device. The same goes for the Tun/Tap driver, which is also used for system virtualisation as well as other purposes like emulating network hardware.\nThe batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Advanced) mesh implementation developed as part of open-mesh.org to spontaneously create WLAN networks can now build a distributed ARP table, which allows non-mesh clients on a network to receive quick, reliable answers to their ARP queries.\nThe rtl8723ae driver for the Realtek RTL8723AE PCIe WLAN chip is new (1, 2 and others), as is the wil6210 driver for a Wilocity WLAN chip that operates at 60GHz and uses the IEEE 802.11ad standard promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig).\nAnother addition to the kernel is the ar5523 driver, which was started over five years ago for the Atheros USB chipset of the same name. Extensions for supporting more chips and WLAN adapters were added to a number of other drivers; the brcmsmac WLAN driver, for example, now supports the BCM43224 Broadcom chip, while the rt2800usb RaLink driver supports the Sweex LW323 USB WLAN adapter.\nThe cdc-mbim driver, which supports broadband modems that implement Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM ) 1.0, specified by the USB Implementers Forum, is also new (1, 2). MBIM is a USB protocol for connecting modems for laptops, tablets and desktop computers that provide an internet connection using GSM and CDMA-based 3G and 4G (including LTE). Aleksander Morgado provides more details on the protocol and its advantages compared to other technologies in a blog post.\nThe kernel's audio drivers now support the Philips PSC724 Ultimate Edge sound card. The kernel can also handle VIA's VT1705CF HD audio codec now. The merge listing the most important changes to Linux 3.8's sound subsystem includes some other changes to audio drivers.\nThe kernel now includes a driver for human interface devices (HIDs) that use I2C (1, 2 and others), using the \"HID over I2C\" protocol designed by Microsoft and implemented in Windows\u00c2 8. Extensions were added to the HID multitouch driver to support some of the features for better finger and movement recognition found in Windows\u00c2 8.\nThe drivers for Video4Linux\u00c2 2 (V4L2) located in the media subsystem can now use the \"DMA Buffer Sharing Mechanism\" (dma_buf) integrated in Linux 3.3 to share buffer space with graphics cards, which makes it possible that data from video hardware will no longer need to be duplicated in the buffer in order for a graphics chip to display it.\nThe kernel developers have marked the uas driver, which handles the USB Attached SCSI protocol, as broken because it causes problems and is not yet ready for the major distributions.\nAlan Cox has given up kernel development for family reasons, leaving his position as maintainer of the serial driver subsystem. Cox is a Linux veteran who maintained the Linux kernel 2.2, during which time he was considered the second most important kernel developer after Linus Torvalds. Although he hasn't been that far up in the ranks these last few months, Cox has still contributed quite a lot to the development of Linux.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T00:34:00Z", "url": "http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-8-Part-3-Drivers-1802696.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Mississippi State won the Southeastern Conference regular-season title one year after finishing in the league basement.\nNow the Bulldogs want to carry the momentum of that dramatic rise into the postseason.\nMississippi State (40-14-1, 21-9 SEC) enters this week's Southeastern Conference Tournament as the No. 1 seed after winning its first regular-season league title since 1989. The Bulldogs had gone 24-30 overall and 8-22 in conference play in 2015 to finish last in the Western Division and post the SEC's worst overall league record.\nBulldogs coach John Cohen, who played for Mississippi State's last SEC regular-season champions, said there isn't much of a gap separating the top of the conference from the bottom.\n\"If you're an inch off in the Southeastern Conference, you're going to get punched in the mouth a lot,\" Cohen said.\nSEC Tournament play begins Tuesday in Hoover, Alabama. No. 6 seed Vanderbilt (41-15, 18-12) faces No. 11 seed Missouri (26-29, 9-21), No. 7 seed Mississippi (40-16, 18-12) meets No. 10 seed Georgia (27-29, 11-19), No. 8 seed Kentucky (32-24, 15-15) battles No. 9 seed Alabama (31-24, 15-15) and No. 5 seed LSU (39-17, 19-11) tackles No. 12 seed Tennessee (29-27, 9-21) in single-elimination games.\nTuesday's winners advance to double-elimination play beginning Wednesday along with Mississippi State, No. 2 seed South Carolina (42-13, 20-9), No. 3 seed Texas A&M (41-13, 20-10) and No. 4 seed Florida (44-11, 19-10). The tournament returns to a single-elimination format Saturday and has a championship game Sunday.\nMississippi State made its dramatic rise up the standings by getting improvement from its new players and receiving a huge impact from its newcomers. Mississippi State's three top batting averages are owned by freshman Jake Mangum (.427) and junior-college transfers Nathaniel Lowe (.359) and Jack Kruger (.358). Kruger has a team-high .570 slugging percentage, Mangum leads the Bulldogs in on-base percentage (.479) and Lowe has a team-leading 47 RBIs.\n\"Those are all three new guys who have just had great first years,\" Cohen said. \"That's not common in the Southeastern Conference.\"\nCohen also led Kentucky to a regular-season title in 2006 and is the second coach to win an SEC regular-season championship at two different schools. Ron Polk led Mississippi State to four SEC regular-season championships before winning one at Georgia in 2001.\nHere are some things to watch in the SEC tournament.\nFIGHTING FOR POSITION: The top SEC teams already are assured of NCAA Tournament invitations but are trying to improve their positioning. Florida, Texas A&M, Mississippi State, South Carolina, Ole Miss, LSU and Vanderbilt all would like to be considered as regional hosts and/or national seeds.\nBUBBLE BATTLE: Alabama coach Mitch Gaspard and Kentucky's Gary Henderson acknowledge their teams are on the NCAA Tournament bubble after going .500 in conference play during the regular season. The two teams face each other Tuesday. \"You've got to win this game, you've got to get to the double-elimination part, you've probably got to beat (Mississippi State) on Wednesday and build those RPI points,\" Henderson said. Gaspard said that \"the winner of that game is going to have a whole lot more comfort after it and the loser is going to be sitting home on pins and needles for a week.\"\nDOMINANT GATORS/TIGERS: LSU has won five of the last eight SEC tournaments. Florida won last year's SEC Tournament and also earned the title in 2011.\nWHO'S SURGING: Mississippi State is on an 11-game winning streak. LSU had won 11 in a row \u2014 including two straight victories over Florida \u2014 before losing its regular-season finale to the Gators.\nWHO'S MISSING: Auburn (23-33, 8-22) and Arkansas (26-29, 7-23) had the SEC's two worst conference records and consequently didn't make the 12-team tournament field. With its losing record, Arkansas also is expected to miss the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2001.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T18:36:13Z", "url": "http://www.tlgnewspaper.com/mississippi-state-makes-dramatic-rise-to-earn-secs-top-seed", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "WBS: why is it important & why it is not important?\nCan somebody post their view or opinion based on practice, why is it that WBS is not important or why is it that WBS is important in managing project?\nI appreciate all ur input.\ncreating a wbs forces you to think about how you are going to dissect your project and organize your project into meaningful groups or packages of work.\nIt is a way to group your work so that people can understand the where's the what's and the how's you will approcah the work.\nfor example if you were looking for an activity in the 2rd floor of Building B and the activities were not group by building and floor it would be very hard to find.\nAlso by using a wbs you can collapse work and summarise work more easily.\nI love a good WBS!\nSee below link to one of our newsletters.\nI started using activity codes even before WBS functionality was available. And I still use them, precisely for purposes as you mentioned - eg filtering the plastering items etc. And since I started using these things from DOS days, I also make use of the characters in activity ID to represent various things. And as you correctly mentioned, it is also possible to get those functionalities from few characters in the activity description.\nIn fact, the best way to input your coded information is in the activity id. That way, the information is \"in built\" and cannot be changed easily.\nAll these things including searching and filtering (eg for filtering for certain characters in activity id or description) work well when everybody is disciplined in naming and coding. And as long as one person is doing all these things, everything works perfectly well for him (as it does for me and you). But when you are integrating programmes from various contractors, it is not easy to excecise those rules with planners from various firms.\nWBS concept is as old as project management but its functionality appeared relatively late. Even in P3 3.1, WBS is still optional function that appears the same way as acivity codes. And some people still don\u0092t use it because 1) it is optional 2) activity codes seem to do the same job and 3) they are more used to activity codes. But even in P3 3.0, WBS code can do things which activity codes can\u0092t.\nFor example, you can have WBS activity and it does not need any links as in hammock activities. And this WBS activity can summarise all the activities which have the same WBS code. When you need a high level programme that shows bars in the same line as activity description (activity code roll up bar appears one line below), you can just filter for WBS activities and you get very good presentation. And the list goes on.\nAnd when you start using P3e, WBS is no more optional and it appears more different than activity codes and thus makes it more apparent. But activity code has more functionality in new programmes as well as you can have second level of codes within same acitity code. And these lower levels of codes work exactly the same way as WBS does. So you can have work breakdown stucture as well as ANY breakdown structure using a single code.\nBut as long as you have to use two or more actity codes (as you have to do in P3 3.1 and earlier), to make your work breakdown structure, it is far more easier to do so using the in built WBS coding. (And you can of course, still use activity codes, for other functionalities).\nI can therefore sort as activity description contains plastering and all the activities drop out. Now If I have also coded for floors and towers I can organise so the towers and floors show up so I know where I am.\nThat means I need to code in a tower and a floor with each activity, thats pretty easy cos I can copy and past this info.\nIf I am really smart when I copy and past the fragnet I can add some alpha numerics at the end of the ID ie 100 activity number from fragnet then T1 (tower 1) then F1 ie the id is know 100T1F1 this helps in that I can sort all activities in tower 1 or floor 1 or whatever so by using the ID and the description almost without touching the codes we have a pretty robust sorting catergory. In turn when you can sort in this way logic application and resource balancing becomes much easier.\nLets go back to the plastering scenario we now have all the activities, so linking floor to floor or globally copying resources is easy as is levelling them because you can see whats happening and more importantly so can everybody else.\nIn this way you can tell your subby exactly what he needs.\nI am not saying you cant do it with WBS and of course you can what I am saying is for a great deal of what we do in building and Civil Engineering WBS codeing is excessively complicated.\nI\u0092m Currently using Hierarchical code structures to help with the application of the cost accounts from our cost tool. I simply apply the codes to the activities and then group and sort with totals and balance my activity budgets.\nSo you can use code fields to give rudimentry totals for Units.\nThis process has helped me immensley as when I started with this company 9 weeks ago there wern\u0092t even any baselines in the projects and they were using units % Complete and just adding extra hours to the remainings by multiples of 10 or 50. They even expected to be able to resource level with this data.\nActivity codes look good and seems to show what you want to show only when data is organized in a particular way (eg phase, location, contractor etc). So it is very much a Layout depedent method.\nWBS works no matter how you organize your activities. And you can have WBS activity (in P3 for example) which summarises all the activities which have the same WBS code no matter where those activites are located. There is no such functionality available for activity codes.\nFurthermore when you organize activities with acitity codes, you will always end up with groups with no names. Planner would understand it but there would be many would be questining it everytime they see it.\nSo when you want work breakdown that really add up to whole project, use WBS. It is that simple. And use activity codes for other organizing and filtering purpose.\nI suppose WBS & Codes are lying on the same concept, so why bother? you\u0092re not showing codes on your schedule anyway.\nDont let anybody walk away with the idea when you have explained something \"gee I wonder what he is smoking\"\nOften in fact more often than I care to remember I dont employ planners because they cant do their job but because they cant explain what their job is.\nRemember we are planners, that makes us somebody who assists the process not somebody who actually does it, so go and assist the person doing it by understanding what he wants not what you feel you should give him.\nThe WBS structure is simply an end to a means.\nThe end is being able to provide BAC, ACWP, ETC, EAC & EV for particular portions of the project.\nThe WBS is simply the most widley used method of doing this, and as a consequence comes as a standard part (or code) of most planning/scheduling software.\nAs far as codes go - well the world is your oyster.\nAs far as how to, and what size, and by what method you chose to quantify and divide your project up, it\u0092s really up to you..... However you should document what each structre is for and what assumptions were made to arrive at the particular structure.\nCBS - Cost Breakdown Structure, ETC.\nAgain I will say it\u0092s limitless to how many you can have, but you should document what it is and how you came up with it.\nThat way when you\u0092re asked to explain a code field that you thought was a good idea at the time - Your manager doesn\u0092t walk away with the \"I don\u0092t know what that guy was on about\" thought in their head.\nthis is very simple! you use WBS or Codes to make your Project become \"Measurable\" either in a summarized form or a detailed one. But how do you put a certain unit to a summarized deliverable? Isn\u0092t it Lump Sum (LS)? and how do you define Lump Sum? are you gonna need WBS or Codes?\nWhile the Explanation is well \"dry but clear\"\nI think all would benefit more if you provided sonme clarity with examples.\nAs I have mention before WBS development can be viewed as the process of grouping all project elements into several major categories, normally referred to as Level One; each one of these categories will itself contain several subcategories, normally referred to as Level Two. Alternately, and more accurately, developing a WBS involves dividing the deliverable items until the project has been divided into manageable, discrete, and identifiable items requiring simple tasks to complete that, when combined, constitute the project deliverable.\nLogically is to keep dividing the project until the elements cannot realistically be divided anymore and may vary from organization to organization or may even vary among project managers within the same organization.\nEach level of detail contains not only organization specific, but they also are specific to the nature of the deliverables involved in each project. Similarly, the degree of detail at the lowest level of each branch must be in line with the size of the project and in conformance with the organization\u2019s operational philosophies.\nIdeally, there should be some uniformity and consistency in the WBS. To achieve this uniformity, all children of the same parent must be developed based on the same division basis.\nUsual practice of WBS are using three division levels which are \u201cDeliverables oriented (Structure or products, functional system, physical area and proof of capability)\u201d, \u201cSchedule oriented (normally referring to a task or activity and sequential/ phases)\u201d and \u201cResource oriented (disciplines, administrative units and financial accounts)\u201d.\nSo again, no matters how you do it by codes or groups fields or using the WBS field as long as you define the structure into manageable level and represent the project deliverable that will contribute to success of the project.\nMost of my work is in building construction, so maybe the fact that I like codes better is biased by my work.\nBut if sometimes you need to see activities organized by floor; sometimes by trade; other time by trade within each floor, etc. There\u2019s no way to do that except with codes.\nDo other lines of work have the same need or is it enough for you to squeeze into a rigid WBS and limit reports and analisys to that single point of view?\nwhat I believe it says is that progranmmes should be structured in such a way as to enable sorting in a logical and affective manner thus enabling the team to ascertain an accurate picture of the progress of the works and the elements that make up the works.\n\"for hard planning thinkers\"?? they don\u0092t know how to use codes?\nWBS show the heirarchy of Scope of work and deliverables.\nWBS is the standard for PMI, PMP, Planning Professional.\nIt is very clear in PMI influence or way of project management in general and planning in particular way of managing project.\nSo for hard planning thinkers, WBS is the preference.\nI think the need and importance of structure in a schedule is clear and proven. The point now is how.\nI prefer primavera codes over WBS or outlines. Codes are much more flexible and let you organize activities in different ways to analize different aspects of a schedule. WBS an outlines are rigid.\nOf course you can use both at the same time, but unless I\u00b4m forced by a client, I don\u00b4t use a WBS, but codes.\nIt\u0092s just a simple divide and conquer technique. It a way to go from general to specifics. It\u0092s like writing a book first you have the outline the going to the details and contents.In a way it helps in organizing a project and simplify the job of a planner.\nBreakdown Structure - Work, Cost, Organization..whatever it is..It is important! I think nobody is using a one liner schedule!\nJust to explain more on WBS. As I have said on the other thread (Work Breakdown Structure is a results-oriented family tree that captures all the work of a project in an organized way. It is often portrayed graphically as a hierarchical tree; however, it can also be a tabular list of \"element\" categories and tasks or the indented task list that appears in your Gantt chart schedule).

{"text": "T he popular YouTuber Lilly Singh who is more prominent as Superwoman is genuinely making marks. Apart from all the social work and impressive collaborations, Lilly has now released a music video. Although nobody was quite expecting it from her, the rap song is definitely on fire. But what makes this song grab attention worldwide is that she brought into light what Bollywood songs would look like if they were turned into a woke rap.\nChoosing three songs from the industry, Superwoman gave them a whole new meaning and added her unique beats alongside it. Needless to say, this version highlights the blatant misogyny in the Bollywood music industry.\nThe internet just can not seem to get enough of Superwoman\u2019s empowering reinterpretation of their favorite Bollywood songs. The YouTuber released her own music video titled If Bollywood Songs Were Rap, with a compilation of three different hit songs. However, she added her own touch to it, and did not just translate the lyrics. There is much more to hear as Lilly has touched upon topics like unrealistic beauty standards of women, mental health issues, bisexuality and so much more.\nLilly Singh has chosen three hit songs including Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai, All Izz Well and Aankh Marey. Apparently, her new rap version is everything that Bollywood never tells you about. Or everything that the entertainment industry gets wrong about women. Superwoman has smashed stereotypes with this new touch. Plus, she completely slayed the rap game.\nWhile sharing the song, Lilly claimed that she loves Bollywood and rap music. So, she decided to make an impact by turning her favorite ones into rap. But she wanted to do more so she added positive and empowering messages into them.\nLilly Singh aka Superwoman is a very popular YouTuber who has a massive following on the platform. She has ventured into various fields doing comic sketched, impressive collaborations including ones with Dwayne Johnson and Priyanka Chopra, and music videos. Apart from doing social work, she is now heading into Hollywood by getting her own late night show.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T18:56:32Z", "url": "https://dankanator.com/17415/superwoman-raps-misogyny-bollywood-songs/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The crash led to an explosion which destroyed petrol pumps and three vehicles.\n+ And in the most recent example, a driver cashed her car into a Route 18 gas station in Bridgewater (MA), severing the pump and causing a small amount of gas to spew from the ground.

{"text": "I found that more often than not, I wanted to put my development environment inside of Docker, not just my running code. My editor has plugins that help me browse documentation and check my syntax, but none of that works without installing additional stuff, and Docker has made me quite averse to installing anything on my host system.\nSo, I started stringing together Docker commands to do what I wanted, and I grew frustrated at all the copy/paste, and thought: There\u2019s gotta be a better way.\nIf you\u2019re interested in how it does this, see the nitty gritty details.\nGo to the releases page.\nMake sure it\u2019s executable and in your path.\n--type go - select the default version (1.6) of the pre-configured Go image.\n--type python --version 2.7 - select the 2.7 version of the pre-configure Python image.\nCurrently, go, clojure, and python are baked in. More will come.\ncreate - Creates an environment.\nconnect - Connect to an environment.\ndestroy - Destroys an environment and its home directory.\nrebuild - Rebuilds an environment, preserving the environment\u2019s home directory.\nrun - Creates an environment and immediately connects to it.\nstart - Starts an environment.\nstop - Stops an environment.\ninspect - Shows details about an environment as a JSON dump.\nlist - Lists existing environments.\nimages - Lists base images or user specific images.\nEnsure that the skegio/python:3.5 image is pulled.\nEnsure that the skeg ssh key is present.

You can create your own image and use it by specifying the -i flag to skeg create or skeg run. For now, your image needs to be based on skegio/base (like nate/aws), but that will change as skeg gets more sophisticated.\nWhy does skeg run the container as a long running process and connect over SSH rather than only for the lifetime of a process?\nDevelopment environments live longer than a single process, and they often involve many processes. Juggling these processes within an SSH session is a well understood problem with great solutions (like tmux), so for familiarity skeg takes the same approach.\nAlso, there are many times where additional software needs to be installed and daemons run to try something out. A long running container is perfect for these situations. Skeg offers a rebuild command, which will destroy and create the docker container with the same environment home directory, making it easy to reset back to a known state.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T21:10:57Z", "url": "http://skeg.io/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

These come in a range of graphics, designs and colours that fit your specific needs.\nAs an alternative to the traditional playground paint applications, thermoplastic markings are applied using plastic cut out shapes which are then heated and melt onto the existing macadam surface of the playarea.

We often complete playground relining in Ackton with coloured designs to replace existing markings which have faded or become unsuitable.

When we started using Trello for our product backlog earlier this year , I thought it was probably overkill trying to get an automated backup of our data, since it was being operated by Fog Creek who have a great reputation in the industry, but I ploughed on regardless and yesterday that preparation paid off.\nWe normally use Trello during our Sprint Review to recap user stories and acceptance criteria and one such meeting occurred at the same time Fog Creek were valiantly trying to keep the service going as New York was battered by Hurricane Sandy. Normally this wouldn't have mattered as we keep paper copies on our scrum board, but for the first time in 13 sprints we were doing our review in Auckland, so these weren't much use.\nSo there we were, mid review, far from home, no story cards, and Trello is going up and down like a whores draws. Compared to what the poor people in the NE United States were going through this was obviously not a big deal, but with a little bit of contingency planning it was a trivial task to fire up Google Drive, open our Trello backup spreadsheet and continue with our review.\nThis outage and the ongoing benefit we get from being able to print story cards from the backup spreadsheet means that it has totally repaid the time I spent writing the script - if you're using Trello for user stories, and you haven't done so already then go set the script up now - there's nothing to lose and everything to gain.\nIt's also a timely reminder to look at all your digital data and think about what would happen if you didn't have access to it, or worse still, lost it permenantly. If your house burned down by a fire, would you lose all the photos of your kids? If your favourite web service went under (financially rather literally) and took your data with them, then what would the impact be?\nIt doesn't take much to get yourself in good shape - get a good automated offsite backup (I use Crashplan) to handle your files, and periodically back up your online data to another service, or even to a local PC and you should be good to go.\nOh, and if you happen to live in the pacific ring of fire, tornado alley, somewhere hot and dry, or indeed anywhere on our rapidly warming planet that has \"weather\" you might want to generally be prepared so that in any eventuality, you manage to Get Thru.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T19:00:36Z", "url": "http://www.littlebluemonkey.com/blog/be-prepared", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "\u201d It may seem surreal, but as work continues to decommission damaged reactors at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant\u2013a project that involves 7,000 or so workers\u2013tours of the complex by outsiders are becoming increasingly popular.\nBy the end of last September, or four-and-a-half years since the nuclear accident triggered by the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami disaster, some 16,000 people had visited.\nInitially, visitors to the stricken facility were mainly politicians and specialists. But more recently, ordinary citizens are taking part as radiation levels have fallen at the plant site.\nNineteen university students took a tour last November. The bus they rode took them past large tanks holding contaminated water as well as a massive piece of equipment attached to a reactor building to extract nuclear fuel. Throughout the visit, workers wearing protective clothing and face masks could be seen.\nThe tour was organized by a group called AFW, which stands for Appreciate Fukushima Workers. Led by Akihiro Yoshikawa, 35, a former employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the stricken plant, the group began escorting tours by residents living along the Pacific coast of Fukushima Prefecture from 2015. A major objective of the tours is to show residents what decommissioning involves.\n\u201cIf ordinary citizens abandon interest, the plant site will be further shut off from the rest of the world,\u201d Yoshikawa said.\nHe said that 140 or so people had participated in the seven tours organized to date.\nIwaki resident Kaori Suganami, 39, took part in a tour last June.\nBecause of the core meltdowns at the No. 1 to No. 3 reactors, high levels of radiation continue to be emitted. This makes it very difficult to approach those three reactors.\nElsewhere, though, rubble that was strewn throughout the plant grounds due to the tsunami generated by the magnitude-9.0 Great East Japan Earthquake has been removed, and radiation levels in many areas have dropped significantly. Ground surfaces have been paved and trees felled, which has also helped lower radiation levels.\nAccording to TEPCO, about 900 people visited in the first year after the nuclear accident. Since then, the annual number of visitors has continued to increase. Local residents joining the tours also grew in number. About 3,700 people visited the plant in the first half of fiscal 2015. Of that number, about 250 were from Fukushima Prefecture.\nUnlike workers at the plant site, visitors are not required to wear heavy protective gear. The basic getup is cotton gloves, disposable face masks and special footwear. Visitors are required to carry dosimeters. To reduce radiation exposure, visitors remain on the bus for large parts of the tour. Radiation exposure after an hour is in the range of 10 microsieverts, which is about 1 percent of the maximum additional radiation exposure of 1 millisievert established for the general population.\nIn April 2014, TEPCO established a visitation center at the Fukushima plant and two to three groups consisting of individuals 18 or older are allowed in daily. But not just anyone is allowed on the tours. \u201cAn overall assessment is made after considering such factors as the objective of the visit,\u201d said a TEPCO official.\nThe decommissioning work is expected to take decades.\n\u201d FUKUSHIMA\u2013Fukushima Prefecture\u2019s population has declined by 5.7 percent since 2010, its largest recorded drop and the cause of a widening gender gap in some areas, according to national census figures announced on Dec. 25.\nThe population drop is mainly due to ongoing evacuations following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, according to the preliminary figures released by the prefectural government.\nThe prefecture lost 39,715 men and 75,743 women, a decrease of 4 percent and 7.3 percent from 2010, respectively. The difference is thought to have been caused partly by the majority male presence in reconstruction efforts.\nThe national census figures are the first released by the prefectural government since the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, which triggered the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.\nFukushima prefecture\u2019s population as of Oct. 1 stood at 1,913,606, down 115,458, or 5.7 percent, from the last census in 2010.\nAmong the six towns and villages where the entire population has left under evacuation orders, four towns recorded zero inhabitants: Okuma and Futaba, which co-host the nuclear plant, and nearby Tomioka and Namie.\nThe village of Katsurao had 18 people who have returned to their homes after being evacuated. They are recorded as temporary residents, but the central government is working to make their resettlement permanent. Katsurao\u2019s evacuation order is scheduled to be lifted next spring.\nNaraha, where an evacuation order was lifted on Sept. 5, also experienced a massive decrease in its population, with 976 people living in the area, down 6,724 people, or 87.3 percent, from 2010. The figures illustrate the fact that few evacuees have opted to return home.\nThe town of Hirono, where a large portion of the population is involved in nuclear reactor decommissioning work, tallied a male population of 2,746, up 2.3 percent from 2010. The female population, on the other hand, was about half that figure at 1,577, down 42.3 percent.\nThe population figures are based on the number of people living in the prefecture as of Oct. 1, irrespective of whether they are registered as local citizens.\n\u201d Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that runs the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant, has opened a rest area and canteen for cleanup workers, more than four years after the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.\nTokyo Electric has been widely criticized for its treatment of workers and handling of the cleanup, which is expected to take decades. A Reuters investigation in 2013 found widespread labor abuses, including workers who said their pay was skimmed and spoke of scant scrutiny of working conditions at the plant.\n\u201cWe have taken various steps to cut accidents, including Tokyo Electric itself working more with contractors on the ground,\u201d Akira Ono, Fukushima plant manager, told Reuters.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T00:18:20Z", "url": "https://japansafety.wordpress.com/tag/cleanup-workers/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Science experiment: Try taking a deep breath through an average soda straw. Not too easy is it? This is basically what your SS has to accomplish with it's stock intake system. Now take a deep breath without that straw in your mouth (for those of you that live in a smog-choked area like Los Angeles or New York City, the State of California wants you to know that this action might be harmful to your health). If you live in a clean area of your state or country, you should feel heartily refreshed afterwards. This is how your SS will feel after you chop the stock intake system and add a new system to help it breath easier.\nThere are many alternatives to get more outside air into your motor, as it is optimal to duct in cooler, more oxygen-rich fresh air, rather than drawing hot oxygen-poor air from the engine compartment with an open-element air cleaner. One in particular that will use a minimum of duct work to direct airflow, is to install a cowl induction or ram-air hood so the engine can draw air directly from the outside of the engine compartment. An added benefit of an induction hood (be it \"ram-air\" style, cowl induction style, or via a hood scoop) is that as you drive faster, more air is pressurized in the intake tract, thereby \"force feeding\" your motor an additional charge of air, proportional to the amount of air the engine needs. Plus an induction hood just has that timeless hotrod appeal that oozes with coolness.\nFor this buildup, I chose a cowl induction hood, to give my 454SS a look that dates back to it's muscle car heritage in the SS Camaros, Chevelles, and the like, and to keep it smooth and clean. Some other hotrodders might prefer a later-model Camaro-style ram-air hood. Others might find they need a hood scoop to clear some air cleaner assemblies. It is nothing more than the preference of the buyer.\nOne consideration that is not simply preference is hood material. Realistic, affordable hoods are made out of two materials: steel or fiberglass. Steel hoods are typically more rigid and heavier than glass hoods, and most are a direct bolt-on for the stock hood. Steel hoods also do not require retaining pins on the front of the hood in most instances. There is some variance of quality but most steel hoods are of good to excellent quality, and your body man is probably better suited to work with steel than glass. On the other hand, fiberglass does not rust. Fiberglass does not dent. You can pick up a fiberglass hood (even a superb quality hood). By yourself. A good quality bolt-on glass hood also does not need hood pins to keep it retained. A great quality glass hood costs about the same or less than a steel hood, and due to the lighter weight, costs less to ship. Glass is my choice. Our options- and metal-laden 4800 pound (most of which is in the front) 454SS's need all the weight reduction they can get. Choose your material. Goodmark makes some of the best steel cowl hoods at glass-competitive prices which feature a 2\" rise, cowl screen, and boasts an extremely OEM-like fit. They can be reached at 770-339-8557, website www.goodmarkindustries.com. Harwood is THE name in auto fiberglass and Lexan, and they can be reached at 1-800-882-7223, website http://www.martelbros.com/harwood/harwood.\nNow with your hood selected and delivered, it is time to fit it on your vehicle. Steel hoods, if you bought a good quality one, should fit right onto the stock hinges, and only require adjustment and possibly some shimming to get the hood in the proper location before you prime and paint. Steel will typically come with a protective black paint coat to prevent rust during shipping. Goodmark notes that their protective coat is meant to be sprayed over, like POR-15 rust preventer is.\nFiberglass requires more prep work. Unlike steel, fiberglass hoods are not stamped out, and thus, must be trimmed, sanded and otherwise fit to the specific vehicle it is being installed on. First, you must remove the stock hood and hinge springs. If it is a bolt-on hood, operating like the one you are removing from the truck, you will be using all of the hardware from the stock hood on the new hood (a sidenote: unless you are building an all-out race truck, you will probably want the bolt-on hood rather than the lift-off or pin-on style hood that requires removal of the hood every time you want to access the engine bay). Now, lay on the new hood and check for fit. The edges of the hood will need to be trimmed. This may be done with a block sander and coarse sanding paper (80 to 120 grit). Sand off a little, then check again, sand a little more and check, etc. until you have the proper fit and finish. Our trucks have a cowl vent between the hood and windshield. Harwood recommends trimming the back edge of the hood to fit this cowl vent as the stock hood did. Once the hood fits perfect, you are now ready to bolt it on the hinges. Bolt it to the hinges, and the hinges to the truck, and check again for clearance.\nIncluded with earlier style Harwood hoods and some other lesser-known brands of hoods is a prop rod. This is intended to hold the hood up, basically taking the place of the hinge springs, as the springs will not be re-used (for steel hoods and for some glass hoods, like the revised Harwood hoods, they are, but most other glass hoods will not withstand this usage). Install the prop rod on the radiator support rail. Harwood said this prop rod is a universal fit, so it is necessary to trim it to fit. Position it in the middle of the hood so as to prevent the hood from twisting while it is on the prop rod. If you position the prop rod to the side, you run the risk of twisting and cracking the hood or paint job.\nFor the later, revised Harwood hoods the company notes that prop rods are not necessary. I spoke with Ray Martel, president of Martel Brothers Performance who owns Harwood, and he said that the bolt-on hoods for many applications have been redesigned and strengthened, allowing one to use the stock hinge springs. If you do not receive a prop rod with your hood, it does not need one, he says.\nNow you are ready to install the hood latch and spring on the front of the hood. Position the hood and adjust it in using the bump stops and adjustment screws. Check again for fit and operation.\nAfter you drive around for a week (or if you are like me, let it sit in the sun for about a week and a half) with an unfinished hood sitting atop your otherwise pristine SS, to allow the gelcoat to stabilize and the fiberglass agents to bond and cure, your truck is now ready to be shipped off to your body shop for finishing, priming, and painting.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T16:40:54Z", "url": "http://test.454ss.ca/Articles.asp?id=78", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

This article reports the findings of the first national study of these Medicare maximization billing practices for home care services. Primary data were collected to determine which states conduct retrospective Medicare billing practices and the amounts recovered from Medicare. Our analysis indicates that seven states recovered as much as $265 million from Medicare in state and federal dollars during the 1990s. Ratios of recovered expenditures-to-costs incurred for retrospective billing practices conducted in Connecticut, New York, and Massachusetts are between 5:1 and 7:1. While retrospective billing practices may aid states in reducing Medicaid outlays and potentially help dual Medicare beneficiaries gain coverage for their home care claims, they increase Medicare expenditures for home care at a time of concern for the long-term financial viability of Medicare and illustrate the need for reforming our national long-term care financing policy.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T19:36:58Z", "url": "https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article-abstract/28/5/859/93380/Adoption-of-Retrospective-Medicare-Maximization", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Sign up to Lineout to stay up to date with all of the latest RUPA news / Thanks for subscribing!\nWith Rugby World Cup (\u201cRWC\u201d) underway the eyes of the world are on our sport. One of the most topical debates across all contact sports is the issue of concussion management.\nAll stakeholders will be looking forward to a RWC in which players, medical personnel and team support staff play their part in managing this important aspect of player welfare. Rugby is making significant progress in the detection and management of concussion and it will be important that other professional rugby competitions move to adopt the standards set for RWC 2015. Rugby should not see the management of concussion as a risk at RWC, but an opportunity to demonstrate how far the game has come in recent times.\nThe International Rugby Players Association (\u201cIRPA\u201d) is constantly thinking about what more can be done to further improve the games ability to manage the issues associated with concussion.\nEffective from 1st August 2015 after a successful global trial period at elite level, World Rugby has now formally introduced a temporary substitution rule. This applies to any player who is removed from the field of play to undertake a Head Injury Assessment (HIA) when it is unclear if that player has a suspected concussion.\nHaving the ability to remove a player from the action and from the cauldron of a packed stadium, to undertake a thorough clinical assessment and video review of an incident, in a private controlled environment, makes good practical sense. Previously players in this situation would often go untreated, or be checked over briefly on field using questionable methods.\nWorld Rugby and other key stakeholders are leading a real culture shift amongst professional players, coaches and medical personnel in relation to peer pressure to play. Recent statistics back this up. Research has underpinned the HIA process throughout. Prior to the temporary substitution trial, 56 per cent of players with a confirmed concussion remained on the field following their injury. Now that figure is less than 12 per cent (British Journal of Sports Medicine, 2014) and the hope is that following continued refinement of the HIA process we will see further improvement in 2015 and beyond.\nA key point lost on many but one that IRPA believes is fundamental to a conservative management approach is that a player is now removed once the attending medics confirm a diagnosis of suspected concussion. This takes the pressure off trying to make a definitive diagnosis of concussion during a high-pressured game. That does mean players will be removed who have not suffered a concussion, but better the conservative approach.\nThankfully the message is getting through and along with World Rugby\u2019s #RecogniseAndRemove campaign, the games stakeholders are realising that it is not just the player\u2019s responsibility but its coaches, referees, and team support staffs obligation to step in if they suspect a concussion has occurred.\nWhilst IRPA see this as a positive step, it is one that needs to be continually developed and filtered down to the community game where awareness and education on the subject is not yet at the same level.\nMedical specialist in concussion monitoring individual cases.\nAdditionally, IRPA is very supportive and engaged on the work that is being undertaken on the laws of the game to ensure the risks of on-field instances that result in serious injury, including concussive events, are minimised.\nThere is much conjecture on if rugby, and concussions sustained playing the game, lead to long-term cognitive health issues. From a player\u2019s perspective IRPA does not want that debate to be a distraction from making sure the right thing is done by the players now. IRPA believes that the game should be doing all it can to ensure the welfare and health of the player is an ongoing priority.\nSo what of the future and in particular the debate of using new technologies to take human error out of the equation? One such advancement that may justify further research and refinement is the use of sensors to help aide team doctors with real-time data. It could provide insight into accelerations and forces that they may not have seen first-hand particularly where the player has either not recognised a head knock, chosen not to seek medical assistance or suffered signs and symptoms post game. The sensor does not diagnose a concussion but rather provides accurate previously unavailable live information which combined with testing (HIA) and baseline data can aid in a clinical diagnosis. In the same way team support staff use other data like heart rates and GPS data, the sensor can provide data to assist medical personnel make informed decisions regarding concussion management.\nFrom a player welfare perspective, IRPA believes the pressure put on players to return to play to preserve their contracts and the rehabilitative support provided to players recovering from a concussion are areas that should be looked at further.\nEnsuring a players contractual terms and conditions are supportive during times of serious injury is fundamental. It allows the player the opportunity to fully recover without the added pressure or threat of having his or her salary or match payments stopped, or worse, the contract terminated. In this respect physical injuries are more obvious and certain, concussion in its very nature is obscure and invisible. Currently there are no set guidelines around minimum standards for players\u2019 contractual terms and conditions. IRPA feels that the time is right to address this, not just because of the issues around concussion, but to maintain the integrity and reputation of the game.\nFor those players who endure concussion complications either as part of their return to play process, or following a decision to stop playing, there seems little available to aide recovery beyond rest and time \u2013 which for an active professional athlete can be a very uncertain and sometimes depressing experience. IRPA would support more research into identifying rehabilitation techniques and programs to help in the resilience building and recovery process, and to ensure they are readily understood and available throughout the game.\nWorld leading player welfare standards are a priority in building the legacy of our sport. It is fundamental to the integrity of the game and to those who participate in it. IRPA is looking forward to continuing to work with World Rugby to bring about the culture change and to enhance the education and regulatory framework that ensures rugby leads the way on concussion management globally.\nThe Rugby Union Players' Association (RUPA) will continue to take a proactive and collaborative approach to concussion prevention and management in Australia sport, as part of its involvement with the Australian Athletes' Alliance (AAA).\nEvery week, RUPA collates five of the best features from the week\u2019s Rugby media and bring them to you in the one convenient location.\nCharlie Fetoai: Jack of all trades; master of plenty!\nFormer Reds centre Charlie Fetoai was seriously injured in 2009 and told he could never play Rugby again.

{"text": "Anyone who has done a quick search on what to see in Norway certainly came across Preikestolen. It is one of the most popular hikes in the whole country. Not everyone experiences it the same way, however. Outdoor Life Norway is a guided service that offers guests a chance to see Pulpit Rock like most will never experience. The sunrise hike is an amazing way to up your chances of getting those stunning views without the crowds. If you truly want an original experience, though, go with their \"Off the beaten track\" tour. This hike begins with canoeing across a glacial lake to a long forgotten trail. Traverse the trail through multiple altitudinal zones and scramble up to the top of the fjord. There you can hike along until you reach your destination, a beautiful view of Preikestolen! There you can enjoy your view that majority of the hikers are missing. From there you will travel down to Pulpit Rock itself for some more photos. The trip down follows the more popular marked trail. If you are lucky enough, you may run into some of the Sherpas that have built the trails! If you're looking for more tours to fill up time in Norway, Outdoor Life Norway offers many guided services year round.\nThe land of fire and ice is an outdoor enthusiasts playground. Scuba diving in Silfra had been on my bucket list for years. It was a massive influence for me to get my PADI Open Water certification. Once I got my certification I remember my instructor asking me where I would go now that I could explore underwater paradises. I excitedly announced I'd be going to Iceland. He did not seem amused. \"Don't you want to start somewhere... warmer?\" I brushed off his remark as quickly as I whisked off my hood and booties. I had my mind made up. Silfra was my white whale and I finally had it in my headlights. When everything was booked, I was struck with panic. For years I had dreamed of Silfra, a place where you could swim between the North American and Eurasian continental plates. Would it be as spectacular as I had made it out to be?? Oh yes it was. The crystal clear glacial water is nearly ice cold and is filtered through lava creating over 300ft of visability. This quality of water means you can sip it while you're diving. It doesn't get fresher than that. Being able to say i've touched both continental plates at the same time in the only place in the world where you can dive directly in continental plate cracks is certainly bragging rights. I thought that would be the highlight of my cold swim in Silfra, but once I was in the water I forgot about the location. The dive was beyone beautiful with such distinct geographical features. The colors were jaw dropping. Though the dive itself was short, it's a dive that I could do over and over again. For those not scuba certified, many tour companies offer snorkeling excursions as well. Dive. Is. offers guests either option with photo services.\nIf you asked a stranger what came to mind when they thought of Iceland, volcanoes would make the list. This is definitely merited. The land has practically been completely molded by volcanic eruptions. If there's volcanoes you know there is lava, but Icelanders don't let it get them down. In fact, it gets them going. These hardened lava fields create the perfect backdrop for some serious mountain biking. These trails are not for the faint of heart. I may have overestimated my skills since I had been mountain biking in the past. I rated myself as an intermediate, which I quickly second guessed as soon as I saw people pull out their own peddles from perfectly packed Camelbaks. As nonchalantly as I could muster, I asked what the tour company's general client level was. My growing suspicion was confirmed. Most were season mountain bikers. I laughed in response to hide my surmounting fear. There was a good chance I may die in Iceland on a bicycle, I thought. There was worse ways to go I reasoned. It would make an interesting story, at least. Alas, I survived. Every part of my body may have hurt the next day, but something else was genuine as well. That was my smile. I signed up for a tour that I was not physically prepared for, but I did not regret it. It was a challenge that I overcame and I saw some stunning scenery along the way.\nFor those of you like me who are not expert mountain bikers, there are more appropriate tours to take. Icebike offers guests several options for different levels of experience. After seeing my lack of finesse in the lava fields, Icebike offered to take me to another location afterwards. I battled with my opposing feelings. Should I stick it out and do another lava field or should I opt for something different? The guide was very patient and genuinely wanted me to enjoy the experience that was right for me. I went with their recommendation. A part of me felt like a quitter until I saw the change of scenery. The lava fields were wild and otherworldly. The new scenery was as lush as if I had been plopped into Neverland itself. My bitter feelings instantly faded. Biking through the purple lupine fields was a magical end to a demanding day. My lesson of the day: Don't be afraid to try new things and have flexibility if they do not work out as perfectly as planned. My biking experience had more hiccups than I had predicted, but biking in Iceland was a once in a lifetime experience.\nUtah snow is world famous. In a location with pristine snow and more resorts than one can choose from, how does one... well, choose?? I struggled with the dilemma during a recent visit. I was down to my last day and I had only seen two resorts. I wanted to end with a bang without draining my bank account on a lift ticket. I gave up and resorted to asking my local friend for direction. \"You need to go to Sundance\". Sundance? I was baffled. This resort had barely made my radar. While I had pondered the pyramid hierarchy of ski resort awesomeness for days, it took my friend no time at all to respond to me.\"Not Snowbird or Park City?\" I bantered. Nope, he was firm. Well that settled my predicament. At the very least it would bring me some mental clarity since I no longer had to wrestle the decision.\nIf you go to Utah and don't visit Sundance Resort, you are doing it wrong. I immediately felt at home at this resort, as if I had been snowboarding there since I learned the difference between regular and goofy. In a world obsessed with modernizing everything, Sundance has made a point of preserving that nostalgic ski culture that we all love and miss. Okay, so the staff is nice. Is that a good enough reason to opt for Sundance over a larger resort? In retrospect, Sundance is one of the smaller resorts, but the views are not. I almost fell off the chairlift gawking at the scenery. From the base to the peak, every corner of the resort offered views that even Ansel Adams would have to stop and photograph. The character didn't stop at the lodge. The terrain kept me smiling from trail to trail. Feeling hungry? Stop at the peak for the most scenic nachos in the game. The Bearclaw Cabin is the only mountaintop lodge in Utah. If the sun is out, opt to sit outside in one of the zero gravity chairs. Sun and snow, can you beat it? If you want a resort with big hearts, big views, and a touch of home, you need to go to Sundance Resort.\nThe sunshine state usually cultivates images of lazy beach towns with a weird abundance of shaggy-haired surfers with names like \"Zander\" or \"Brock\". If you don't think of surfing, chances are you think of a retirement home paradise with every pm dinner special you could imagine. I am not here to knock your idea of Florida, because both scenes I just described exist in North Florida. I mean what's wrong with eating your food truck burrito while your barefoot at a reasonable time so hard to get on board with? You have time for dessert and digestion before you catch those zzz's! This is a battle meant for another day. If you aren't into shredding the gnar or attending senior bingo, you may wonder what Florida has to offer other than concrete amusement parks. Rejoice my friends because I have a solution. Though it may not be topping your vacation brochures, Florida offers great places for paddle sports. These sports can be enjoyed by any age group. Are you a seasoned kayaker looking for a challenge? Opt to try paddle boarding instead for a great core workout that perfects your balancing skills. Are you more into the outdoors just to get a tan? Select a tandem kayak and make your buddy do the brunt of the work. I know this because I've been the recipient of this. As I paddled with all my might in Norway and wondered why we weren't going faster, my friend Randy sat behind me happily snapping photos enjoying the fruits of my labor. I did not learn my lesson, however, since here I am recommending his devious plan to all of you. Just make sure your friend takes the front seat and doesn't read this passage. You're welcome.\nThe Aloha state is paradise: sunny, laid-back, umbrella drinking mai-tai kind of paradise. Though many people come here to do nothing more than read their book on the island's 30 miles of beaches, Maui can also be an adventure hot spot. I mean literally. The highest peak on the island is the world's largest dormant volcano. The impressive Haleakala volcano never ceases to draw in outdoor enthusiasts from around the globe. Want to feel like Hawaiian royalty? Opt to catch a mesmerizing sunrise from it's peak. Haleakala National Park offers guests more than just the star of the show. The park offers beach access but my favorite swimming spot of the entire Maui trip was dunking into the Seven Sacred Pools, or the Pools of 'Ohe'o. If mermaids emerged from the depths, I would have thought it perfectly normal. I loved being able to climb up to a series of the falls and sit under the cool,flowing water as I looked out at the ocean. Some pools are more popular and accessible than others. As I mentioned, the pools flowed into the Pacific so that contrast in scenery was fantastic. Pack a picnic to make a great day of pool adventures. Swimming does not get more exotic than this. After you have your fill of swimming, continue hiking through Haleakala National Park to dry off. Your efforts will be rewarded when you reach a stunning bamboo forest. You may think you accidentally arrived on another continent with the landscape change.\nHaleakala is not to be missed and you can access it off of the famous Road to Hana. The road itself merits a few days to explore. Opt for a convertible so you can soak up as much roadside scenery as you can. If you are still craving big views, end your trip with a cherry on top. A helicopter tour of Maui may not be the most physical tour you can do, but I promise you will be feeling the adrenaline. The tour gives you access to views you would never be able to see otherwise. Get close to peaks and waterfalls alike. The views are breathtaking and you may just get the feeling that you are about to be dropped off in Jurassic Park.\nI can never be satisfied with doing everything just like everyone else. If I am going to a stereotypical tourist spot. I need to have an element that is different. While doing my research for antelope canyon, I found just what I was looking for to satisfy my stubborn self. Hidden Canyon Kayak was Arthur and the day trip through Antelope Canyon was my sword in the stone. At first I was a bit disappointed to see how large my group size was. In the past I have been spoiled with much smaller guide to tourist ratios in my travels. Once in the water, however, the problem dispersed as quickly as waves off my boat. The guides were good at accomodating people of all ability levels. As a frequent kayaker, I had a much faster pace than most. The guides recognized this, and made sure I did not feel restrained. Once we reached antelope canyon, we were released to explore the slot canyon on our own to a certain point. Again, I was happy to hear this since I much preferred being alone than attached to families I didn't know. It was a thrill to be able to skip, run, and even sing if I wanted to down these beautiful corridors. I loved this tour and would recommend it to anyone. The guides were relatable and I enjoyed my time talking to them. My only recommendation is if you are an experienced kayaker, let the guides know ahead of time and they will bring you a touring kayak. Compared to my kayak at home, the kayak I was given made me feel like I was moving through mud. Avoid this and request a more efficient boat. They just don't like to assign them to someone who is not experienced and has a higher chance to tip the narrow boats.\nHave you ever thought that mountain biking is cool, but it would be so much cooler to bike on Mars? I can't say i've been on this train of thought before, someone out there has been. To them I say, Mars is too far away. Sure you can keep fantasizing about the day that Richard Branson and Elon Musk unite like superheroes and create martian colonies complete with lotteries to fuel us basic humans with dreams of dual planet citizenship. Okay, maybe I have thought of this before. I digress. Biking in Page, Arizona may be the closest alternative. Really, the place is out of this world! So aren't my puns. Accessible right from town, I was told by a local to check out the Rimview trail. I stopped at a local shop, Lake Powell Paddleboards, and rented a mountain bike. A quick overview of a map and a heeding message of \"there are parts of the trail that if you get hurt or can't finish, no one can come get you\"and I was off. A little skeptical of my skill after my warning, I wasn't sure how my day would go. Quickly into the trail, my reservations disappeared. It was easy to with the beautiful desert landscape. The \"rimview\" gets its name for a very specific reason. In parts you were on the very edge of the trail with a steep drop off. If it got too hairy, I simply walked. It was my best option since I was alone and if I got hurt, I didn't want to think of the desolate potential situation. The views of Lake Powell were breathtaking. What blew me away was that I had the trail virtually to myself. In a busy tourist town, I came across only two people my whole time biking. The two people were locals at that. It was my escape from vacation. A step away to truly take in a place. This was not without hard work, however. The trail had its difficult moments and was best suited for at least intermediate riders. If you are new, you at least have the ability to walk any dangerous spots. The heat is also draining. A lot of water and snacks for energy are a must. I can honestly say my lunch was well earned this day.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T20:19:10Z", "url": "http://eatsandfeats.blogspot.com/p/feats.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The latest in Jazz North East\u2019s series of Schmazz gigs at the Jazz Caf\u00e9 featured British guitarists Mike Walker and Stuart McCallum. All seats in the upstairs room were taken (two of the north east\u2019s finest six-stringers bagged prime seats) and the stage resembled the guitar section of your local musical instrument store. The Greater Manchester-based duo settled down to play the first of two mainly acoustic sets in a setting Walker later described as having \u2018a good vibe\u2019.\nThe material consisted of original compositions (a Schmazz prerequisite) and one or two standards. The opening number had an Americana feel to it, so it came as no surprise to learn it was Bill Frisell\u2019s Where Do We Go? Walker, a man with an impressive cv \u2013 the big bands of Mike Gibbs and Kenny Wheeler, stints with Julian Arguelles and Nikki Iles, to his latest Anglo American project, the Impossible Gentlemen \u2013 shuffled a set list at will, suggesting to McCallum they do \u2018Orpheus\u2019. A change of guitar, some retuning, a bit of banter and into Luiz Bonf\u00e1\u2019s Black Orpheus. This and the following number \u2013 All the Things You Are \u2013 exemplified Stuart McCallum\u2019s penchant for reharmonizing tunes. Dark tones, dense improvisations, Walker picking up on McCallum\u2019s initial foray, further solo invention, the seamless dovetailing of ideas.\nA Walker composition \u2013 Wallenda\u2019s Last Stand \u2013 inspired by the life story of a high wire walker\u2019s final, fatal, do or die journey and McCallum\u2019s The French Song illustrated their talents as tunesmiths. The second set heard McCallum\u2019s Beholden and Walker\u2019s Clock Maker. Walker introduced the latter number with a hilarious, true tale of his friend saxophonist Iain Dixon\u2019s father\u2019s clock making obsession. Imagine a house full of clocks \u2013 He made one every four minutes, said Walker \u2013 all primed to chime on the hour. It was Walker\u2019s mission in life when visiting Dixon Snr to leave before the cacophonous clock chorus struck up! A distinct folk strand ran through the second set, notably McCallum\u2019s tune inspired by a visit to the Shetlands and his authentic folk ballad Seasons. The one time student of Walker has gone on to work in a variety of contexts including a plum job with John Surman, tenure with the hip Cinematic Orchestra and work with Tim Garland\u2019s Northern Underground Orchestra (including an appearance at the Durham Miners\u2019 Gala a few years ago). This Schmazz gig was one for students of the guitar rather than one for the jazz guitar purist.\nEarlier, pianist Paul Taylor played a solo set in the downstairs bar. The Tyneside-based Taylor developed ideas from an impressionist palette, quietly applying complementary hues to an uncluttered canvas. The audience listened intently, some seemingly holding a breath, such was the silence during a half hour improvisation.\nNext month\u2019s Schmazz concert at the Jazz Caf\u00e9 departs from the usual last Tuesday in the month date. The double bill of Troyka and Pulcinella can be heard on Tuesday 15 July.\nGreat gig, very inspiring gig Mike!\nThoroughly enjoyable gig left the jazz cafe buzzing.

{"text": "Amber Lilyestrom, an amazing branding and business strategist, dreamed of being a stay at home mama well before having a child. At 8 months after her daughter was born, Amber took a leap of faith, quitting her job with only ONE CLIENT! Amber knew that focusing her time and energy on her business was the only way it would grow, and quitting her 9-5 turned out to be the best decision because it led her to her KILLER business. She is passionate about branding and business strategy and hosts her own podcast, and a two-day conference for women who want to take their life and career to the next level.\nWe were so inspired by her fierce work ethic, and wanted to create a website that reflected her passion. Amber wanted her site design to be bold, elegant, and CLEAR to visitors on exactly who she is. Amber had strong content and we loved getting to design a gorgeous website around it. Go Live did not design her main logo, but we designed the Ignite Your Soul logo (pictured above!) for an upcoming event and had so much fun with it. Here's a HUGE CONGRATS to Amber on the launch of her new website, and for turning her dream into a reality.\n\"My entire life has transformed as a result of the choice to pursue my dream and make the leap to launch my business.\"\nAmber's story of courage and passion will inspire and encourage you in your own journey!\nAmber: I have always been fascinated with human behavior, psychology and really understanding why people do what they do. I have been equally obsessed with helping people breakthrough their fears and roadblocks to live a more fulfilling and joyful life. I grew up witnessing the people I love struggle and made it my goal early on to create a different way of life for myself so I could make a positive impact on the lives of others by showing them what I learned. What better way to take ownership of your life than to match your work with the sacred mission?\nAmber: I worked in collegiate athletics marketing for a decade and had the gift of contributing to the growth of a Division I athletics brand on a national scale. My career path there was incredibly entrepreneurial and I taught myself how to write sales copy, design websites and graphics and basically everything in between. I was also asked to teach at the university and mentor students throughout my career, both of these roles allowed me to hone and develop my craft as a coach.\nAmber: The answers do not live out there, they come from within. I've spent thousands of dollars on coaches and programs and live events only to be guided on back to my own truth. I do not regret one penny spent or mile walked on this path, though, as it has helped me to become even better at what I do and more committed to the bigger mission of my life.\nAmber: The funny thing about this question is that so many people DID tell me that \"Everything I need is already within me.\" But, I didn't listen because I had to go on my own quest to find my way home to myself. I am so grateful for all of the people who patiently and lovingly stood by me on this journey, I am certain I will need them to continue to remind me of this message, once again, down the path.\nGO LIVE: WHAT WAS THE MOMENT YOU HAD WHEN YOU SAID \"I SHOULD DO THIS\" OR WHAT MADE YOU TAKE THE LEAP INTO WORKING FOR YOURSELF?\nAmber: I had known that I wanted to be a work from home mama well before I was pregnant, only I didn't know HOW it was going to happen. After my own near-death experience (aka wakeup call) during our daughter's birth, I knew that it was time to get serious about making this dream come true. I launched my business 8 months after she was born and quit my job with just one client on the books (crazy!?), but I knew that if I could welcome in one client, more would come and focusing my time/energy on my business was the only way to help it grow. Four years later, I am so grateful for that courageous former version of me.\nGO LIVE: WHAT THINGS HAVE YOU GAINED, OR DO YOU HOPE TO GAIN, IN YOUR LIFE FROM FOLLOWING THIS DREAM?\nAmber: I have my life, my health, my husband (we retired him from his police career in 2017), the memories with our daughter that I haven't had to miss a minute of, sacred friendships with people I would have never met, time with the people I love the most and a deep sense of fulfillment and personal growth that comes with it. My entire life has transformed as a result of the choice to pursue my dream and make the leap to launch my business.\nAmber: I absolutely love your design work and the way you approach supporting visionaries like me in sharing our message and mission with the world. I so appreciate how you tend to the finite details while honoring the big vision and delivering a finished product that will make a massive impact. Our websites create a powerful experience for our future clients to feel fully witnessed as they take the next step on their journey. I am so thrilled with what we've created together.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T06:12:48Z", "url": "https://www.golivehq.co/blog/amber-lilyestrom-is-live-on-squarespace", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "It was time to pack up camp and head north. Our drive to New Bern/Beaufort area was only 2 hours; allowing ample time to do some exploring!\nOur camping destination was Flanners Beach Campground, located in the Neuse River Recreation Area in eastern North Carolina. This campground sits on a bluff which overlooks Neuse River and only a half-hour drive to the quaint town of Beaufort, NC.\nWe made our way to our site which was perfect for us. It was a large with trees all around lending privacy. We were close to the bath house as well, very handy as there is no water/sewer service. After our site was set-up, it was back on the road for some adventure.\nTips: Bring your bikes as the trails are easy and beautiful. If it is summer, you may not want to count on cooling off in the river. The water would be considered not warm but hot and stays shallow for a long way out. It was a dismal experience.\nOur first stop in Beaufort was the North Carolina Maritime Museum. We learned about this museum at the Crystal Coast Visitor Center back in May 2016 on our New Bern adventure and was told it was a \u201cnot-to-miss\u201d museum for pirates fans!\nThe first thing we did when we arrived at the museum was watch a documentary on Blackbeard\u2019s life history (and that of other pirates), and his exploits in the waters off North Carolina. It was very well done and kept the kids interested to the very end. The best part? Artifacts from Blackbeard\u2019s Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge that we saw in the documentary are on display in the museum!\nHelen Aitken, a volunteer at the front desk, greeted us warmly and offered to get Drake and Mia set-up with a clipboard and pencil so they could participate in the museum scavenger hunt. She also mentioned to them that if they completed it, she would allow them to touch a REAL whale heart. What better motivation is there?\nThe museum is chock-full of interesting exhibits documenting life at lighthouses and lifesaving stations, the NC seafood industry, and motorboats through the years. The highlight, of course, was the artifacts from Blackbeard\u2019s wrecked flagship, Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge. You won\u2019t see treasure (we learned Blackbeard removed all the good stuff when he ran aground) , however, you will see cannons, grenades, belt buckles and beads. Truly amazing to see!\nWhen the kids were done with their scavenger hunt they went back to see Ms. Aitken. True to her word, she had them follow her to the whale heart exhibit. As she was telling us interesting facts about whales (did you know that the size of heart a whale is born with is the same size they\u2019ll have as an adult?), a little crowd gathered around. Next, she opened up the display case and allowed everyone to gently touch the whale heart. Incredible!\nNext, she pulled out a small jar of whale oil. Of course we all know that it was used for centuries for heating but I wasn\u2019t as educated that it was also used in the auto industry. She rubbed a tiny amount on our hands to feel how incredibly silky the consistency was. It did have a pungent odor which I did identify as smelling before. Perhaps when my grandfather and father worked on vehicles many years ago. Ms. Aiken said that if you left it on for awhile the smell becomes similar to coconut oil. Not sure that I got that, but I can say it softened my skin!\nTip: Don\u2019t forget to walk across the street to visit Harvey W. Smith Watercraft Center where they teach boat-building for all ages.\nBy this time we were starving! On a recommendation from the Aitken\u2019s, we made our way to Clawson\u2019s 1905 Restaurant & Pub for lunch; located on the main drag; Front Street. Housed in the former Clawson\u2019s Grocery building, the owners display historical memorabilia on the walls to help preserve this piece of Beaufort\u2019s history.\nThe Aitken\u2019s had mentioned the Seafood Bisque as being a \u201cmust-try\u201d so we got a bowl to share. This creamy based soup with loads of scallops and shrimp was definitely a hit with Drake & Mia! I found it to be delicious as well. Too soon the bowl was empty and our main courses arrived.\nI had the Flounder plate; a generous portion of lightly fried-golden fish paired with French fries. Clawson\u2019s offers a kids menu and had a Fried Shrimp plate for kids which my seafood-loving kids loved. Troy had the Angus Burger, cooked perfectly and also delicious.\nNow that we had filled our bellies, it was time to check out one more recommended place in Beaufort; the Old Burying Grounds. Located just a couple- minutes walk from Fleet Street, it is definitely worth a visit. We paid a quarter to get a brochure on the \u201cGrave Sites of Interest\u201d and started our tour.\nThe graves here date back to the early 1700\u2019s and believed to house victims as far back as the Indian Wars with the Coree and Neusiok Indians. There are many other old graves with the oldest legible date being from 1756.\nMany graves hold ship captain, soldiers and local residents, however, there are several graves that have unique stories to be told. One of the most colorful is \u201cGirl in Barrel of Rum.\u201d A young girl went to visit London with her father in early 1700\u2019s and died on the voyage home. The father didn\u2019t want to break his promise to his wife of bringing his daughter home so instead of burying her at sea, he purchased a barrel of rum from the captain and placed his daughter in it so she could be buried at home.\nAfter our visit, we returned to the living and enjoyed an ice cream while checking out the numerous quaint stores lining the waterfront.\nOur last stop of the day was to Cape Lookout National Seashore Visitor Center. Here, Drake and Mia picked up their Junior Ranger books and we were able to learn more about what we could expect on our day at both Shackleford Banks and Cape Lookout National Seashore.\nTips: Island Express Ferry Service does operate out of Beaufort, however, during my research, I realized that we would have to choose one destination; either Cape Lookout National Seashore or Shackleford Banks (home to more than 100 wild horses). The other deciding factor not to take the ferry out of Beaufort was the trip to Cape Lookout would be a 3 \u00bd hour round-trip! If you want to save time and hit both destinations on the same day, my recommendation is to use Island Express Ferry Service out of Harkers Island (about 1 hour drive from Flanners Beach Campground).\nNext up? Our amazing day at Shackleford Banks, Cape Lookout National Seashore and a quick trip to Oriental, boating capitol of North Carolina. It was one of my favorite days of the whole trip!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T04:42:40Z", "url": "http://rvadventureswithkids.com/rv-adventure-2017-day-in-beaufort-nc/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "As her favourite colour is purple I knew I had to use that colour. A month or so ago I found some purple sugar and white sugar pearls. I wanted to do a kid cake that was elegant given her age. That was as far as I got until the morning of the day everyone was coming. Talk about a decorating block! I just couldn\u2019t think of anything. Fortunately on the walk with the dogs I got an idea. And it had to be done quickly as I had an hour to do this. Yikes!\nNot only does she like purple, she likes butterflies so I decided to go with that. I whipped up some buttercream icing like I did for these cupcakes. Before I added the purple I scooped some white into a decorating bag.\nCarefully place the top layer on and brush any loose crumbs off.\nIce the whole cake smoothing as best you can. Isn\u2019t this a great purple?\nNext I used the white frosting to outline the flowers and butterfly. Finally I got the consistency right and it flowed like it should. In the past I was squeezing with all my might. Too much work. I used the white pearls for the centers and the purple sugar for the petals and wings. I really need to problem solve getting the sugar where I want it to go. There was a bit of colouring outside the lines with this bit.\nTo finish it off I added some icing dots on the sides.\nThis entry was posted in Desserts and tagged apples, baking, buttercream icing, chocolate cake.

Very special.\nWhat a sweet cake\u2026love the flowers and butterfly as I\u2019m sure she did as well.\nDaughters are so~ precious. Happy Birthday to your 12 year old\u2026 I love purple too and she will love it! Fae.\nWhat a fabulous looking cake! Yes, my favourite colours are deep crimson and purple.

In short, an agarose gel is infused with reference antisera and holes are punched in the gel. Antigen is placed in the holes and diffuses into the agarose. The distance that the antigen diffuses into the agarose is measured as a precipitate \u201cring\u201d in the gel after staining.

{"text": "Mercedes has lifted the veil and presented the new X-Class. Mercedes X-Class is the company\u2019s first large scale production luxury pickup and we reveal all its secrets, including the prices for the German market. The X-Class will be available in Europe, Latin America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. No USA.\nThere it is, the Mercedes of the pickups. Following the 2016 reveal of the close to production concept, the series X-Class has now been revealed in South Africa. Sales start this November with a basic price of 37,294 euros.\nIt is widely known that Mercedes is buying the technical base from the Renault Nissan Group, the X-Class is based on the Nissan Navara and is also being built at Nissan\u2019s European headquarters in Barcelona. In contrast to other \u201cbadge engineering\u201d models such as the practically identical duo Mitsubishi L200 and Fiat Fullback, Mercedes has \u2013 having learnt its lesson from the experience with the Citan \u2013 heavily updated the Nissan Navara donor base and created an unique interior and exterior design.\nOn the technical side, the ladder frame and the drivetrains are primarily identical. In addition, the basic cell of the cabin and individual body parts such as the doors are identical. Nevertheless, the Mercedes X-Class is a completely new car, from a design stand point.\nThe front is dominated by the radiator grill with powerful big star and two cross chrome bars, the headlights with LED daytime running lights are smaller and more aggressive. Depending on the equipment variant, the lower apron is decorated with a large chrome surround, lacquered in car paint or molded in dyed plastic, which is more robust. At the rear, we notice the extremely narrow high-angle lights, an unusual styling idea in the pick-up camp. Mercedes is fitting a rear bumper to every X-Class, depending on the variant painted in car paint or in chrome, \u201cnaked\u201d commercial vehicle variants as with other manufacturers will not exist.\nIn the chassis department, Mercedes has made major changes to the Nissan Navara. Wider gauge and its own optimized for road use will bring a considerable improvement compared to the Nissan. This is to be desired, because the Navara chassis is despite all coil springs quite rustic and bumpy. On the other hand, Nissan technology can be used again for engines, at least for the time being. The two variants of the 2.3-liter turbodiesel with single- and twin turbocharging (163/190 hp) are known from the Navara, in the Mercedes they operate under the designation X 220 d and X 250 d. Both variants are available with rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive and come as standard with a six-speed manual gearbox, while the X 250 d is also offered with a seven-speed automatic. The all-wheel-drive variants have a switchable off-road 50/50% traction lock switch and optionally a rear axle differential lock.\nIn contrast to the prospective main competitor, the VW Amarok V6, Mercedes will only offer a V6 variant from 2018 onwards. Powered by Mercedes\u2019 own three-liter V6 diesel, the X 350 d with 258 hp and 550 Nm will be the most potent midsize pickup ever. The X 350 d is equipped as standard with the seven-speed 7G-Tronic automatic and is available with permanent all-wheel drive only.\nParticularly much work has been done in the interior design, with hardly one part lifted from the Nissan. From the Navara was taken only the small switch unit in front of the gear lever, from which all-wheel drive / support, hillside control and the rear axle lock can be operated. Otherwise everything is new. This begins with the door panels and handles and continues over the entire dashboard, which is now covered side-to-side with a full-surface mid-section plastic ornament. The rotary push button for the Comand system is integrated into the center console, the instruments with round screens and the central info display and the multi-function steering wheel are the same as in the current Mercedes SUV line-up. Many details, such as the control panel of the climate control system or the design of the round fan nozzles, are known from the Mercedes GLA. In addition, Mercedes promises an unusually high individualization potential for pickup conditions with various color and decor variations. Despite all this, the interior designers had obviously no easy task with the constructive specifications of the base. Individual details such as the fan nozzles or the Comand controller have the effect of being retrofitted.\nWith the assistance and media options Mercedes X-Class takes full advantage of the brand\u2019s parts bin. The X-Class already has the eCall system, which is required from 2018, and also the technical prerequisites for online services. For this reason, the optional me-connect system can be used to access the vehicle via a smartphone, for example, to determine the location or to check the tank content and tire pressure. In addition to the voice-controlled Comand Online, Mercedes also offers the 20 USB and 20 CD audio systems from the other series for the X-Class. Tracking, traffic signs and active brake assist are on board as well as a trailer stability program, cruise control and LED headlights. In addition to the rear-view camera, a 360-degree camera system with Birdview mode is available at an extra charge.\nMercedes will offer the X-Class in three different equipment variants, which also differ externally. Base is the X-Class Pure with a dark plastic apron. In addition, Mercedes offers the X-Class Progressive, in which the apron is lacquered in car paint. With its chrome apron, the top equipment X-Class Power can easily be recognized. The upcoming V6 is only offered in this version. In addition, Mercedes already plans to offer a pickup-typical accessories program such as a hardtop and loading area cover or off-road accessories at the start of sales.\nThe market launch of the X-Class will take place in Germany and Europe in November 2017, followed by South Africa and Australia in early 2018 and Argentina and Brazil in early 2019. On the export markets, a petrol engine with 165 hp will also be part of the program. There will also be slightly less pompous versions available. The X-Class 350 d with the V6 diesel will come in mid-2018. According to Mercedes, the demand for particularly luxurious and comfortable midsize pickups is steadily rising, which is why the X-Class, unlike the competition, will only be available as a double cab with an already comprehensive basic equipment. Real workhorses with minimized rustic equipment are not on the program for Germany. In the face of the basic price of 37,294 for the X class 220 d Pure with manual transmission (for comparison: the Navara prices for the 2.3-liter double cab start at 31.110 Euro) may be assumed that for the top model X-Class 350 D will cost around 60,000 euros.\n\u041d\u0430\u0448 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0431 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0441 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e HOMTOM HT20 Pro \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T07:31:58Z", "url": "http://japannavi-chita.info/mercedes-x-class-is-official-everything-about-the-new-luxury-pickup/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "For the month of April only: Receive Dermapen 4 Face & Neck Treatment + An Alginate Mask + IonZyme Machine Treatment for only R1,500 (all inclusive).\nWe are proud to launch the new Dermapen 4 at Natural Aesthetics. We were the first clinic in South Africa to receive the Dermapen 4. So what makes the Dermapen 4 so much better than the Dermapen 3 or any other microneedling device?\nDermapen 4 has a 16 needle cartridge instead of just 12 needles, reaching an inflammatory response at a much quicker rate.\nThe Dermapen 4 generates 47.9% more micro-channels than Dermapen 3 and 104% more micro-channels than any counterfeit device.\nThe Dermapen 4 generates 1,920 puncture channels per second, which means we can almost double the amount of serums and actives that we needle into the skin per treatment, than before.\nThe additional 620 micro-channels makes the treatment much quicker and more comfortable than before.\nDermapen 4 is the only microneedling device with a dedicated scar setting and protocols for revision of deep, atrophic scars; including surgical, burn contracture, striae and post-acne scars. Needle penetration can now be increased up to 3.0mm.\nAOVN technology, automatically calibrates the motor speed, pressure and penetration for targeted precision.\nThe Dermapen 4 is safer than other microneedling devices, no dragging or pulling of the skin.\nOnly Dermapen 4 features a unique, medical-grade silicone seal and fluid guard. The external cartridge is fortified with a specialised fluid guard that prevents cross contamination to the outer cartridge shell. Safety First!\nSpecialised retention valves relieve the build-up of procedural pressure within the Dermapen 4 needle cartridge. The effect prevents fluid build-up within the needle cavity. The vacuum-like sensation removes the risk of cross contamination whilst ensuring pressure-free contact to the skin during a procedure.\nTop: Medical grade numbing cream applied for 20 \u2013 30 minutes, we then needle medical grade serums and actives into the skin via the Dermapen 4 device. Bottom: An Alginate Mask is applied and connected to our IonZyme Machine. A medical grade concealer is applied to speed up recovery and cover any immediate post treatment redness.\nThe Dermapen is an award winning micro-needling device.\nWe use the Dermapen 4 to create safe pathways to deliver quality anti-aging serums deep into the skin.\nNew collagen and elastin are now being produced by the body; tightening the skin and healing scars, fine lines and literally keeping the skin young and full of volume.\nWhat is the Dermapen 4 good for?\nSkin conditions: Treat pigmentation, skin texture, oily skin, acne and sun damaged skin.\nThe numbing cream that we apply is a 30% Lidocaine medical-grade numbing cream that is only available at medical practices. Should your skincare \u201cclinic\u201d, not have an overseeing doctor, chances are that you are not receiving the appropriate numbing cream (only a 2% Lidocaine), which can make this treatment uncomfortable.\nThe concentrated actives in the mask are delivered into the skin immediately after a microneedling treatment to instantly cool and soothe the skin and to improve the skins health complexion.\nThe IonZyme machine introduces the use of Pulsed Iontophoresis; the use of a specifically pulsed electrical current to facilitate penetration of vitamins into the cells.\nImmediately post this microneedling treatment, we apply an Alginate mask over the face. We then connected it to our IonZyme Machine to send an electrical current via the mask. This reduces inflammation to speed up recovery. The mask itself is infused with skin corrective peptides and anti-inflammatory actives which makes it the perfect compliment for the skin after a Dermapen treatment.\nNatural Aesthetics is not a spa of \u201cbeauty salon\u201d; we are a medical practice.\nOur Therapists are specially trained to administer medical microneedling and IonZyme Machine treatments safely and correctly.\nEach of our Therapists have also received special training by Dr Wade Merchant to further ensure that our patients receive the safest and most effective treatments.\nFor the month of April only: Receive a Face & Neck Dermapen 4 Treatment + An Alginate Mask + IonZyme Machine Treatment for only R1,500 (all inclusive).\nOR call us on 021 433 0967.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T18:46:37Z", "url": "http://naturalaesthetics.co.za/dermapen-4-launch-face-neck-special-april-2019/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Thanks Francesca, you're amazing, I love them! thank you!\n\"I received the most beautiful gift today. And this little story of its arrival on my doorstep needs to be shared.\nA few months back I was travelling in country NSW in Australia and was scheduled to do an event on the last night of my stay. It was cold.\nSo I pulled myself together (like I do) to be of service and speak on all things food and nutrition to a small group of people. In the audience there was one shining light that stood out to me. She radiated so much light and we connected after I talked. She shared with an extremely vulnerable heart, her health concerns.\nAnd I offered my support in the coming weeks.\nWe connected every few days and I helped her see where she could improve. Our connection was in stolen moments and after she felt confident in the knowledge I had shared, I gave her space to absorb all that she\u2019d learnt to she could put all into practice.\nWhat I didn\u2019t know, in the weeks following was that she had had such profound shifts.\nHer symptoms lifted, her energy returned, her ability to feel joy crept back into her life.\nYou see, when asked why do I coach, the answer is always the same.....to help people return to self. To feel joy again.\nToday, I received this beautiful gift, all the way from Milan. This beautiful human had this Pink Kunzite necklace made for me. I had truly made my day and I\u2019m so grateful. Who would have thought that a random act of service can create such immense love and joy for all.\"\n\"I don\u2019t know how I found Francesca but I am so glad I did. Lots of thought and love goes into everything she makes. It\u2019s not jewelry. It\u2019s so much more.\nyou work together to pick which kind of specimen to use.\nShe might know right away or you might know. Or you might have to decide between a few. But she works with the crystals and narrows it down.\nThen You pick from her collection which stone you feel drawn to. In my case, I let her tell me what I needed. She picked 6 pieces of Rubellite tourmaline.\nAnd then I picked the from that. It\u2019s absolutely perfect.\nAnd I got it the day if the new moon so it could not have worked out better.\nThank you so much Giardinoblu Jewellery Milan!!\"\n\"Working with Francesca was an absolute dream. I had been wanting to transform a beloved herkimer diamond into a pendant and, after purchasing several jewelry pieces from Francesca and seeing the level of care she puts into her work, I knew she was the only I would entrust my gemstone to.\nFrancesca loves gemstones and respects their energy, and that was very important to me when choosing someone.\nFrancesca made the whole creation process simple. She first shared some designs and, once I liked them, I sent her my stone via courier. Once she had it, she got to work, showing me every step of the way, and seeking my approval before moving forward.\nI loved how she kept me regularly informed of where we were in the process and listened to my observations. She was kind and courteous at every step of the way, and ended up creating a jewel I will treasure forever.\nI couldn't be happier with the necklace Francesca created for me. It's perfect in every way, and beams with positive energy.\"\nPhotographer, Stylist & Visual Strategist, Marcela Macias Photography.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T01:41:19Z", "url": "https://giardinoblu-jewellery-milan.myshopify.com/pages/feedback-diary", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "African/Lake Malawi cichlids have very specialised feeding habits that have been adapted so that they can survive in their natural habitat. However aquarists tend to make it easier for themselves by getting readily prepared flakes and pellets. But you will have to take into account whether your fish are herbivores or \u2018piscivores\u2019 (feed on other fish). Mbuna species are normally herbivore, so they will mainly feed on the algae that grows on rocks, so they must be fed on plant food. These fish cannot digest animal fat and will suffer from indigestion if fed on it.\nOn the other hand most Lake Malawi cichlids will eat small crustaceans like Brine Shrimps.\nA lot of cichlid breeders make up their own homemade food, made from chopped up shrimp and peas.\nThaw out the shrimps and peas and mince them finely in a food mixer, then add the vitamin drops. Finally pour in the dissolved gelatine. The gelatine will bind the mixture, producing a thick paste after it has cooled. Place the paste into a freezer bag, flatten and then freeze. Now this nutritious fish food can easily be cut up into convenient pieces, and given to your fish.\nA wide range of foods are commercially available, like flakes and pellets. It has been noticed that cichlids feed very enthusiastically on flakes, while pellets sink to the bottom, so any other inhabitants like catfish can get it. The choice is yours.\nA further important source of food for your African cichlids, are frozen foods like white and black mosquito larvae, brine shrimps and krill.\nMixes including beef heart and frozen RED mosquito larvae are not suitable for Lake Malawi Cichlids.\nHow often you feed your Lake Malawi cichlids depends on their age. Fry (Newly born fish) must be fed more frequently and in smaller portions than older fish. Fry should literally be swimming in food in order to grow quickly and develop properly.\nHerbivores are more used to feeding in small portions over the day, so feeding them once a day will not be enough. And you must take care to only put in the right amount of food. It should take about 1 minute for all of the food to be eaten.\nAdult cichlids should be fed 2-3 times a day while the fry should be fed 5-7 times a day. If the fish are fed regularly then their aggression should be reduced.\nNever feed your fish just after you have switched the light on as they will need reach their full levels of daytime activity. The African cichlids rest at night and it takes them about thirty minutes to become fully active. And for similar reasons, you should not give them their final feed just before turning the light out.\nIf you don\u2019t think that you will be able to feed your fish at the correct times each day, then you should consider installing an automatic feeding machine.\nIt is important not to overfeed your fish as your cichlids will consume anything, and in huge quatities if they can, which can harm their health. Healthy African Cichlids will always await their food eagerly.\nIf an adult cichlid is eating poorly or refusing food then don\u2019t feed them at all for one full day afterwards as it may be overfed. If they still fail to eat after the day off, then they may have contracted a disease.\nThey are. Were they cichlids or tropical fish? Thank you for your comment by the way.\nI love aquarium fish and used to keep quite a few of them. They are a lot of fun and beautiful to watch.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T00:40:14Z", "url": "https://pethelpful.com/fish-aquariums/Lake-Malawi-Cichlids-6-The-Right-Nutrition-For-African-Cichlids", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Ginkgo biloba supplement from Walmart was found to actually be powdered radish, houseplants and wheat despite the fact that its label said it was wheat and gluten-free.\nWalgreens is pulling the problematic supplements from shelves. Walmart plans to reach out to suppliers and take necessary action to ensure the safety of its customers. GNC says the company is willing to cooperate following this investigation, but stood behind its own supplements and testing system. Target so far has not issued a comment.\nThe attorney general\u2019s office conducted its test by purchasing 78 bottles of the four retailers\u2019 top brands from a dozen Walmart, Target, GNC, and Walgreens stores in the state.\nHealth care experts have warned about the potential dangers of the unregulated supplement industry for some time, including in a 2012 review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Certain ingredients, like high amounts of caffeine, pose risks for certain consumers.\nConsider getting your supplements from a reliable source like Natural News where you know it is being tested for not only containing that which the label lists but also to be free from toxins and heavy metals. Another very reputable company for good quality supplements is Life Extension.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T08:40:59Z", "url": "https://www.naturalnewsblogs.com/4-major-retailers-caught-selling-fake-supplements-check-list/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The location of the July 15, 2002 flare is shown at left. The other panels compare the scale of Earth to the eruptions. Red shows superheated gas held together by magnetic fields. The time sequence lasts only 80 seconds and yet reveals tremendous amounts of gas leaving the Sun.\nA detailed study of a huge solar eruption reveals that a series of smaller explosions combined in a domino effect to fuel the blast.\nThe findings improve understanding of the Sun's most powerful events and could lead to better forecasting of the tempests, researchers said.\nScientists studied data collected from a radiation flare on the Sun on July 15, 2002. The eruption, ranked as an X-7, was one of the most powerful in recent times. The flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which is a colossal discharge of electrified gas called plasma. The event was 5,000 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\nScientists don't know exactly what triggers such eruptions. They are associated with strong magnetic fields, however, and emanate from sunspots, which are cooler regions of the Sun that correspond to bottled-up magnetic energy.\n\"Sunspots are at the surface of the Sun, and are essentially the footprints of the magnetic field,\" explained Louise Harra of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. \"The magnetic field reaches into the outer atmosphere in the same way as for example a bar magnet has a magnetic field around it.\"\nResearchers had thought the big eruptions are created when magnetic field lines from the core of a sunspot become tangled and reconnect high in solar atmosphere, or corona. The new study contradicts that assumption.\nX-7 flare started when plasma from below the Sun's surface broke suddenly through.\n\"Below the surface of the Sun a dynamo process is working creating magnetic field,\" Harra explained in an email interview. \"When this becomes buoyant it can rise to the surface of the Sun, and into the atmosphere.\"\nThe plasma collided with a strong magnetic field at the surface, and the interaction triggered release of \"phenomenal amounts of energy,\" the researchers concluded. There were three eruptions, each triggering the next.\nThe gas was heated to 36 million degrees Fahrenheit (20 million Celsius) before being flung up into the solar atmosphere at 90,000 mph (40 kilometers per second).\n\"We have observed the flows of hot gas for the first time, enabling us to see that several small flares combine to create a major explosion,\" Harra said. \"This may eventually enable us to predict large flares before they erupt.\"\nNot all solar flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, and nobody knows for sure why.\n\"It must be a combination of the magnetic field strength and the magnetic configuration that will allow field lines to be opened and hence the release of gas,\" Harra said.\nThe observations were made with SOHO spacecraft, a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency. The results were presented last week at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T08:44:55Z", "url": "https://www.space.com/950-sun-triggers-major-eruptions.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Not feeling well today, so back in bed at eleven in the morning. Sore throat. Sinus pressure. Yuck.\nI will say, though, it's nice to be alone up here in my room in the middle of the day with some items I have come to count as dearest companions - my Bible, journal, daily devotion book, thankful journal, and a collection of gel pens.\nCurrently, I am reading Jesus Calling, by Sarah Young. Filled with lovely little reminders of God's presence and His love for me, this daily devotional helps focus my thoughts either to start my day right or rest peacefully during the night.\nAlso by my side today is God's Wisdom for a Mother's Heart, by Bobbie Wolgemuth. This has provided hours and hours of conversation starters for the bi-monthly mentoring group I help lead at my church. Though only 128 pages in length, we have used this book for more than a year. The girls in Moms to Moms meet the first and second Wednesday nights of the month, a sort of round-table, open forum where no topic is off limits, but mostly parenting and reassuring that they're going to make it. We study the Word, pray, laugh, cry, teach each other, and we are all growing.\nMy co-leaders and I agree these young ladies with their children around them are our heroes. Represented are single and married moms, working outside and inside their homes, public/private/homeschooling moms...you name it, we've got it. This is one group we hate to miss. A gift from God. Truly.\nMy thankful journal is simply a little leather-bound book where I record the gifts God has given me. Eucharisto. Thanks. One Thousand Gifts. 10,000 reasons. Why write them down? Because I dare not forget the goodness of God. In the remembering and the acknowledging I am overwhelmed with reassurance that God is my provider, comforter, healer, friend, joy, strength, and so much more. I am much less likely to lose my focus and wander if I am remembering God's deeds and giving thanks.\nLast, but certainly not least, is my personal journal. It may as well be my heart on paper. This is where it all comes pouring forth to be sorted, processed, saved or discarded. You know, keep the good and throw out the chaff. That's what the journal is for - it is fearsome, yet necessary. Necessary for me anyways.\nThere are a few more books I could talk about. Don't know about you, but I read several at once. These I mentioned were simply the lucky ones to be carried into the sick bed with me today.\nDo you have reading materials you count as \"dearest companions\"? What are they and why are they special to you?\nI also have the Jesus Calling devotional, Karen had mentioned it a long time ago, and I finally got it.

{"text": "SEF Canada is working with artisanal miners in Ecuador to eliminate mercury in gold processing while developing local economies. SEF Canada\u2019s managing director Suzette McFaul discusses the project\u2019s community-driven approach to developing more sustainable practices in artisanal gold mining.\nMiners in the Clean Gold project are transitioning from mercury to cyanide-based processing methods. Image courtesy of SEF Canada.\nClean Gold has partnered with the University of British Columbia and others to form a technical \"dream team\". Image courtesy of SEF Canada.\nArtisanal miners often struggle with the brutal economics of small-scale production and accessing markets. Image courtesy of SEF Canada.\nMcFaul with a worker on-site in Ecuador.\nOn 16 August, the Minamata Convention on Mercury entered into force, marking the culmination of a years-long effort to come up with an international response to the shared threat of mercury exposure.\nWhile mercury has been used in industrial processes for hundreds of years, its extreme toxicity poses massive public health risks. Mercury poisoning can cause irreparable brain damage and organ failure, and low-level exposure is a significant cause of premature deaths.\nThe Minamata Convention, named after the Japanese city that has been living for decades with the consequences of a mass mercury poisoning, brings with it tighter controls for the handling of mercury in industry, as well as provisions for what it calls the \u201cphase-out and phase-down of mercury use in products and processes\u201d.\nIt also means renewed scrutiny on the use of mercury in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) in many countries, and artisanal gold mining in particular. Mercury is used extensively in ASM operations, and often in highly unsafe domestic conditions, to process ore and recover gold.\nBut for small-scale miners working with simple tools and lacking the deep pockets, greater pressure to stop using mercury hasn\u2019t changed the economic fundamentals of their trade. Technical limitations mean that recovery rates are low and the grey market buyers of their gold, often jewellers, offering far below spot value. \u201cAnd that\u2019s if they don\u2019t get mugged on the way in a cash-based society,\u201d says McFaul.\nAfter being invited to southern Ecuador\u2019s El Oro province in 2014 to see how SEF\u2019s economic development model might help artisanal mining communities, McFaul established Clean Gold Community Solutions (Clean Gold) to take a more holistic approach to improving ASM standards in the region.\nThe company has partnered with artisanal miners, along with a technical \u2018dream team\u2019 led by the University of British Columbia, to make the transition away from mercury processing, while also taking on the upgrade of a local gold processing plant to refine the miners\u2019 products and instilling business development skills to empower the miners as business owners.\nThe plant, which McFaul says should be up and running \u201caround next week\u201d, will switch out mercury for cyanide in the recovery process, as the latter breaks down much more quickly if released. But the partnership, McFaul stresses, is about more than just replacing a harmful industrial element; it\u2019s about building new, sustainable systems centred around the plant.\nIn turn, transparency around processing methods and environmental performance facilitates access to markets that will offer close to spot prices for the miners\u2019 gold, rather than the 40-60% of spot price that McFaul says they get from grey market buyers.\nAt the heart of Clean Gold\u2019s model is prioritising the economic and social health of the whole community that surrounds ASM operations. This starts with only partnering with miners who have invited the company to do so, and developing the local economy is part of the deal.\n\u201cThe community has to buy in and the community has to win,\u201d says McFaul. \u201cThere\u2019s a community foundation that comes out of every Clean Gold project. \u201cThe community has to agree, and the miners agree, that part of that community foundation will go into an SEF model to help all the other people in the community.\nThe approach aims to be the polar opposite of the exploitative, opaque relationships that can characterise mining communities\u2019 interactions with large-scale mining companies. Putting the reins in the hands of the community helps create a virtuous cycle that is key to the wider economic development plan, even if a hands-off approach presents its own challenges.\nClean Gold is keen to expand its methods to ASM communities around the world. Plans are already in place to set up another project in Ecuador next year, and McFaul is hoping that the current plant upgrade and community development scheme will be a strong showcase to help sell the concept to prospective future investors.\nIf the money can be found, there is apparently no shortage of demand for the Clean Gold model. The company has already visited Guyana, and McFaul says invitations have been extended from neighbouring Colombia, as well as Kenya and Mali.\nCertainly there are challenges still to come. If the model is to be a true success on its own terms, it will be vital that miners and local families are as happy with the profit-sharing arrangement as the investors. But if the project in El Oro Province can make its environmental, ethical and business case, it could set a progressive template for cleaning up artisanal gold mining while also encouraging sustainable growth in communities that often live well below the poverty line.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T02:33:37Z", "url": "https://www.mining-technology.com/features/clean-gold-making-artisanal-mining-work/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Starting XI Prediction: Solskjaer to keep 4-3-3 formation with Lingard, Rashford, and Martial leading the attack against PSG?\nManchester United return to UEFA Champions League action against Paris Saint-Germain at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening. It is what the Theatre of Dreams is made for, European nights under the floodlights. Last season, United made it to the same stage of the competition, losing to Sevilla and exiting the competition. This season, under the management of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, things may go a bit different for the Red Devils. Confidence is high and United are undefeated in 11 matches, winning ten and drawing one.\nNow is perhaps the best time to face the French champions as Neymar is out of the match and striker, Edinson Cavani limped out of Saturday\u2019s 1-0 victory over Bordeaux. PSG are a competent team but playing in France, they do not really have much competition which may be a negative ahead of this game, as United have been challenged in every match they have played, showing the difference between the Premier League and French football.\nThe Spanish number one was rarely tested against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Saturday but when he was, he was at his best. There are suggestions that the goalkeeper is calling for a \u00a3350,000 per week wage to sign a new contract at United, which is fair considering that he is the player who has been the difference for United \u2013 more often than not. He seems players like Alexis Sanchez on a high wage, yet in terms of what he offers United, De Gea offers so much more.\nUnited have managed to keep two clean sheets in their last two matches, which shows that some things have changed for United under Solskjaer. Ashley Young and Victor Lindelof were rested against Fulham, with the \u2018ice man\u2019 suffering from a knock. I expect both will be back against PSG with Luke Shaw keeping his place and Eric Bailly partnering Lindelof, which has seen both players in good form recently. Solskjaer has Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and possibly Marcos Rojo to select also, keeping options open.\nUnited\u2019s best midfield will be tested against PSG on Tuesday. Ander Herrera, Nemanja Matic, and Paul Pogba. Both Herrera and Matic allow Pogba to play further forward, which has seen the Frenchman play some good football recently, also seeing him score eight goals and five assists in his last ten matches under Solskjaer. This United midfield has the form, the ability and the experience to work the magic against PSG at the Theatre of Dreams.\nMarcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard were both rested in the 3-0 victory over Fulham at the weekend, meaning they will both be fresh to face PSG at Old Trafford. Anthony Martial played 70 minutes against Fulham, scoring a sublime goal, also getting an assist, which will mean his confidence will be high ahead of the Champions League match. These three, on their day, can be devastating to any team. If United manage to keep a clean sheet at home, the quarter-finals could be set for United this season.\nPreview: U23\u2019s out to fight for their futures against Reading?\nWhere did it all go wrong for Luke Shaw?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T13:21:34Z", "url": "http://mufclatest.com/starting-xi-prediction-solskjaer-to-keep-4-3-3-formation-with-lingard-rashford-and-martial-leading-the-attack-against-psg/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "When people ask me what my favorite horror film is, I guess they would expect me to say \u201cHalloween\u201d or \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d And while I do love those movies and they, along with \u201cPsycho\u201d for instance, would be in my top-five of the genre, I say that my favorite in the genre is definitely \u201cThe Haunting.\u201d And the trouble is, I always have to back up that title by labeling it \u201cthe Robert Wise haunted-house film from the 1960s\u201d because I know that they\u2019re thinking of the other \u201cThe Haunting\u201d (the 1999 Jan De Bont remake of the 1963 film with Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones). I\u2019ll have something to say about the remake later and why it definitely doesn\u2019t work in comparison to its predecessor, but I truly love the original film. In fact, I love it so much to admit that it\u2019s just my favorite scary film\u2014it\u2019s one of my all-time favorite movies.\n\u201cThe Haunting\u201d is a superb, gorgeously-shot, very well thought-out chiller that uses psychological tension and character development in the same concepts of mystery and atmosphere. It takes place in a haunted house\u2014Hill House, to be exact\u2014and it\u2019s about a group of characters who would like to investigate the supernatural occurrences of such a place but get much more than they expected. That premise sounds pretty simple, but Wise\u2019s direction, along with great cinematography as well as great acting, makes it far more than what it could have been. Even if you don\u2019t really find it very scary (it depends on whether or not you accept the \u201cless is more\u201d aspect\u2014I\u2019ll explain later in this review), it\u2019s still a gripping psychological thriller, Gothic story, and character study.\n\u201cThe Haunting\u201d begins with an opening narration over a shot of an ominous-looking mansion in the night, and right away, the narration sets up the premise in a most interesting way. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard a depiction of a haunted house, or rather just exploring a haunted house, has ever been put in a better way. \u201cAn evil old house, the kind some people call haunted, is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House has stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there\u2026walked alone.\u201d And when the intellectual voice of Richard Johnson puts it like that, I think I might follow him as well as those his character, Dr. John Markway, are brought into his experiment. And yes, his experiment is simply to investigate any sort of paranormal activity while spending several nights in Hill House. The house is full of history that connects to further evidence that it may be haunted, which fascinates him even more. He wants to know if everything he\u2019s heard and studied is as real as it may seem.\nBrought in on the project are Eleanor \u201cNell\u201d Lance (Julie Harris), clairvoyant Theodora \u201cTheo\u201d (Claire Bloom), and the house\u2019s cynical new heir, Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn). Eleanor, in particular, is our main focus of the film, as we hear her inner thoughts a good amount of time and has the most compelling character arc of the group. She\u2019s a meek, insecure, guilt-ridden woman who has spent most of her adult life caring for her sick mother until her death, leading to further severe guilt that she has to deal with everyday. She seeks to belong somewhere with somebody, which is why she does take a chance and leaves her sister\u2019s apartment (where she sleeps on the couch), and steals her sister\u2019s car to make her way to Hill House, where she is finally expected somewhere.\nHill House itself is a marvel to look at. It\u2019s a large, maze-like mansion that looks like a Gothic castle, with many secrets and unsettling decorations and such. Among the most notable unsettling locations in the house is the library, which features a tall, spiraling staircase that is very rickety and unsafe. The exteriors and interiors of Hill House are just extraordinary and the whole place gives off a creepy vibe. You definitely can tell that something is not quite right with this place. Eleanor notices this upon first arriving, thinking to herself that \u201cit\u2019s looking at me\u201d and if she goes into this house, she\u2019s afraid she won\u2019t come out the same way. But she does come inside, get to know Markway, Theo, and Luke, and surely enough, many strange things occur with apparent supernatural forces at work here.\nBut how much of the supernatural is actually \u201csupernatural?\u201d We spend so much time with Eleanor and we know that she isn\u2019t quite mentally-stable because of her insecurities that sometimes take her over, so you have to wonder just how much of this ghost-story is actual ghosts and how much of it is actually in Eleanor\u2019s mind. It\u2019s evident that ghosts are real in these surroundings, as Eleanor is not the only one to experience these happenings. But what about when she explores the house herself and feels herself to be more at home, in a way depicted creepier than it sounds? Is she being controlled by the paranormal forces, is she letting in to her hopes of belonging somewhere, are her insecurities getting the very best of her? I won\u2019t go into too much detail about what I get out of the connection between her and Hill House, but trust me when I say it\u2019s an excellent psychological study. And that this is a character who seeks redemption and acceptance within a haunted house makes it even more unnerving.\nIt\u2019s hard to pick my favorite \u201cscary moment,\u201d as most people choose their own favorite scary moments from their favorite horror films (the opening in \u201cHalloween,\u201d the exorcism in \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d the shower scene in \u201cPsycho,\u201d and so on). There are literally more than I could think of right off the bat, and oddly enough, every time I watch the movie again, I find myself unnerved throughout the whole movie because of those many moments. To name some of these scenes, I\u2019d start with the introduction in which we see in flashback (with help of Dr. Markway\u2019s narration) the past historic happenings of Hill House (suicide, accidents, etc.)\u2014it\u2019s a great opening and also very well-crafted in how it\u2019s able to set up the environment and build up suspense for the rest of the story, and of course quite unnerving. There\u2019s the first occurrence on the characters\u2019 first night in Hill House, as Eleanor and Theo are frightened by loud, pounding noises coming from outside their bedroom and hold onto one another in fear\u2014the terror is genuine and the scares come as unexpected so that the characters\u2019 fear becomes ours, because we know just about as much as they do. Most memorably, arguably, is the scene in which Eleanor awakens at night to hear what sounds like a child being beaten and crying in pain. She wants to yell but is too afraid to, and she holds hands with Theo who is obviously as frightened as she is because, as we hear through Eleanor\u2019s inner thoughts, she is holding on to her hand a little too tightly. When she finally yells \u201cSTOP IT!\u201d and the lights turn on, she looks to see that\u2026nobody was holding her hand the whole time. This is a perfect \u201cscary moment\u201d\u2014the buildup, the tension, and the payoff are all very well-handled, making the standard-but-needed question \u201cWhose hand was I holding\u201d seem all the more impactful. There are many more moments like that in this movie. And do I even need to mention that the aforementioned \u201ctall, spiraling staircase\u201d comes into place for a crucial moment later?\nThe casting of the four principal roles is spot-on. Julie Harris is excellent as Eleanor, creating a believable portrait of an odd, meek woman who is possibly misguided to find a place to feel accepted. It\u2019s a great performance and it makes \u201cThe Haunting\u201d more of a character study than a haunted-house story. Richard Johnson is also great as Dr. Markway, a man who could convince you to jump off a cliff if he found a solid reasoning behind it. I love the way he puts the supernatural occurrences most of us have heard of, particularly the difference between \u201cghosts\u201d and \u201cghouls.\u201d Claire Bloom makes Theo her own character and also gives a certain indication that she might actually be a lesbian, which could explain why she acts the way she does toward Eleanor (compassion mixed with teasing most of the time) and also would give another disturbing sense in the scenes when they\u2019re the only ones in a room together. Bloom makes risky decisions with this role, but they\u2019re never over-the-top and are played effectively. I even enjoyed Russ Tamblyn\u2019s comic relief\u2014as Luke, Tamblyn plays a man who doesn\u2019t believe in the supernatural or the phenomena; he\u2019s just protecting his investment after being left the house and simply enjoys poking fun at whatever experience or little detail that the other characters bring up. He\u2019s a smooth, wisecracking guy who likes to drink and crack jokes (\u201cThis ghost I can expect in my room tonight\u2014is it male or female?\u201d), which makes his ultimate belief in what\u2019s really happening here all the more effective because all this time, he has served as a representation for some of the more cynical audience members. When he finally seems as scared as everyone else, it\u2019s believable.\nThe filmmaking serves as another reason \u201cThe Haunting\u201d works as well as it does. A good number of shots in this movie looks like it\u2019s been fully prepared for first, so that we feel a hint of unease and also fascination. Even the reaction shots, which are mostly thankless, say something about the consistency\u2014some of them are even at low angles with characters on either the right or left side of the screen. With a location as grand as Hill House, it\u2019s important to know how to frame certain shots and Robert Wise obviously went out of his way to create something unique.\n\u201cThe Haunting\u201d is undoubtedly my favorite horror film. Its scares are more than effective because of how much its psychological terror works well. The themes are very well-presented. The depictions of the \u201chaunted\u201d aspects of this house and the occurrences are fascinating to listen to. The lead character of Eleanor is a great character for this sort of story. And it fascinates me and of course continues to scare me every time I watch it. It\u2019s a well-crafted, excellent chiller.\nNOTE: I mentioned the brilliant opening lines earlier in this review. I should also add that the similar-sounding ending lines are even more chilling, particularly because of who says them.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T10:34:17Z", "url": "https://smithsverdict.com/2013/07/29/the-haunting-1963/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Molten fuel solidified as abundant water was poured in and has been cooled by flowing water ever since.\nIs there any possibility that this molten fuel (fuel debris) will become critical again?\nTo judge this, measurement of \u201cradioactive noble gas\u201d such as Xenon plays a big role.\nRadioactive noble gas is an important indicator of the presence of criticality for it is created in fission reaction.\nGas discharged from the containment vessel which covers the pressure vessel is closely monitored by the \u201cgas management system.\u201d The system analyses the kind and amount of each component in real time.\nShould there were any recriticality, radiation level of radioactive noble gases would increase indicating the presence of the state of criticality. The radioactivity level of radioactive noble gas at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant so far has been maintained at a very low level that is incomparable to what was observed in the critical state of the accident.\nIt has never increased as to show critical signs up until now. This signifies the nuclear fuel once melted in the accident is kept in stable condition (maintained in subcritical state).\nTemperature of the now-defunct nuclear reactor in which molten nuclear fuel is cooled is also measured in real time. It is about the same as the outside temperature or a little colder (around 15 to 30 degrees).\nThis means heat accompanying criticality is not only generated but also the amount of heat emitted by the decay of radioactive materials is very small.\nAs a safety measure, equipments to inject boric acid water to halt the chain reaction of nuclear fission are installed in case re-criticality occurs.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T13:51:50Z", "url": "https://synodos.jp/fukushima_report/22450", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Worldpay was owned by Royal Bank of Scotland. Bain Capital and Advent International bought a majority stake.\nIn late 2013 they took full ownership, valuing the company at over \u00a32 billion.\nThis new ownership has lit a fire under the organisation who has now stepped up it\u2019s operation, with a new focus and a newly energised management team.\nBecause Worldpay operate on such a large scale it was important from the beginning to develop a core idea which would tell their whole story through their branding. Yes they process transactions and provide payment solutions, but what they really do is connect people. They enable buyers and sellers to interact with one another from anywhere in the world, seamlessly and with ease.\nAn exhaustive set of iconography enables the brand to transcend language across the 40+ countries they operate in.\nOf course, there\u2019s a new logo, inspired by the data trails made by money as they travel around the planet seamlessly.\nBrand work for the new London HQ, including new systems for navigating almost 100,000 square feet of offices in the Foster + Partners designed Wallbrook Building in the City of London.\nThe move to Wallbrook brings together five offices to one central state of the art London hub. We worked with the TSK group on the interior design to bring the brand world into the space without it becoming repetitive badging.\nThis is what the old Worldpay website looked like.\nWe worked for over a year to create a strategic approach to the newly invigorated brand analysing and redesigning hundreds of touch points. Everything from how the brand speaks to people, the imagery it uses, iconography it employs, to installations in the new and existing offices have been created by SomeOne.\nSomeOne elsewhere on Identity Designed: Wright Brothers, Big Eyes, Resonate.\nMore work on the SomeOne website.\nOverall very nice. I agree with Naill that the 2d logo is a tad bit awkward. I would bet at a smaller scale and in print it is looks quite elegant, but this large scale isn\u2019t doing it any favors.\nI think the tone and esthetic quality of the type and symbols is very appropriate. It reminds me of the animated videos\u2014which were keyed to Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue\u2014that they would play preflight in United Airlines airplanes. I think that same grand, busy, and connected world tone is resonating here.\nWhile the loxodrome and wordmark are a big improvement on the previous design, I think there\u2019s a disconnect between the logo and the custom alphabet and icons.\nI find the logo to be a bit forgettable although the loxodrome is really well done, but the alphabet and icons are truly lovely. The write-up edges close to hyperbole in places, and I don\u2019t find the website to be particularly radical, but it is a finance company after all.\nHaving said that, the whole thing \u2013 website, packaging, stationery, etc \u2013 is lovely (mainly thanks to that gorgeous bespoke type).", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T12:11:14Z", "url": "https://identitydesigned.com/worldpay/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Are you thinking about using online assignment help platforms? If you answered yes, then you are definitely not alone. This service is increasing in popularity across the globe. It makes it easier for students to handle their school requirements. But the nature of the service remains shrouded in controversy. After all, teachers and professors give out assignments for a reason. They are meant to boost the skills of students both inside and outside the classroom. This begs the question: Do assignment help services benefit or hurt students?\nIt\u2019s easy to see the benefits of hiring assignments experts to aid in your academic pursuits. They solve the problem of insufficient time to do homework\u2019s, especially if you take on multiple part-time jobs after school hours. As you know, writing essays or completing complicated assignments can take up a boatload of time. Between gathering information and adding the final touches, your assignment can take several hours to finish.\nThe speed with which you can finish your assignments with the help of service providers like the guys at Do My Assignments is another huge benefit. Most companies accept expedited requests for an extra fee. It\u2019s possible to get your paper or assignment in as little as 24 hours. While these aforementioned benefits are surely hard to resist, it\u2019s worth noting that using assignment writing services offers more than meets the eye.\nAt first, it might not appear to make sense that hiring assignment help providers can improve your research skills. You don\u2019t even need to research about anything. They will do everything for you, and this is where you can get tips from the experts.\nBy looking at the final output of the assignment expert, you could see how much it differs from the homework\u2019s you have done yourself. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise if these differences are very noticeable. You could tell that time and effort has been dedicated to producing such a well-researched assignment. Even the references and links can help you with your future requirements, as you would see how much more credible your work will look like if the links aren\u2019t limited to Wikipedia.\nThe same applies to your presentation skills. The way the essay, research paper, or assignment is formatted can give you ideas on how to better structure your content. Notice how the ideas flow smoothly throughout, allowing you to get the point across even without the use of fancy words. You probably have a \u201cgo-to\u201d format for your essays, but you\u2019ll realize that it doesn\u2019t always work.\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss assignment writing services as only for lazy students who do not care at all about learning. But it\u2019s important to understand that the students can enjoy much more than its time-saving benefits. With the help of experts, you can pick up some tips on how to research about a topic, what credible sources to use, and how to present your ideas in a way that engages readers. All of these can prove beneficial for any student, even the ones who do remarkably well in class.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T06:32:07Z", "url": "http://oddculture.com/assignment-help-services-benefit-students/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Stefano Guzetti is a composer, producer and sound designer based in Sardina, Italy. He has an ensemble that has released three albums, Home Piano Book (Volume One), Ensemble, and Leaf. He was previously an ambient electronic musician as Waves on Canvas. While not touring Stefano produces soundtracks and sound design for film, documentaries and video games.\nInnerversitysound: Stefano, a bit of background first. You had a recent earlier electronic outfit called Waves on Canvas that produced electronic music that was received well enough given the scene. But nothing in comparison to the reception that your three albums with your ensemble. Can you tell us a bit about the departure from electronic music to a form of modern classical ensemble? What was the impetus for you for this break?\nStefano: Basically I had a graduation in electronic music from the conservatory in my town. I was very into electronic music and I had studied it a lot. But also from childhood I had a background in classical music because I studied organ, or an instrument with a keyboard. Then I made this Waves on Canvas project and it was very great for me and also it was a way of mine to give a rendition, or a proper tribute to what I was into when I was younger, especially 4AD stuff in the Ivo (Watts-Russell) era. But in regarding electronic music I\u2019ve got this mixed feeling. Especially nowadays when everyone can buy a computer, a laptop and record some seagulls or birds with their smartphone and then download a version of Ableton Live, add some effects, some tweaks and then claim himself an electronic musician or a drone music musician.\nOne of the reasons for the change was I wanted to take a distance from all of this because now a lot of people, a lot really, are making electronic music. If you take an example of the 90\u2019s when buying music gear was really expensive and it wasn\u2019t something that was ready at hand for everyone, which wasn\u2019t a good thing anyway, because in my opinion everyone should have the opportunity to say something musically. It was different, now everyone is making electronic music and to my personal subjective perception most of them sound the same. Because they are done with the same environment, the same software, a laptop and so forth. This was one of the reasons but I also just wanted to get back to simple things and try to say something musically, just for me. Interested in just a few things, natural acoustic sounds for instance, and I wanted to get back to my roots, because when I was younger I was just playing an instrument as well. So this is something that really made me decide to be just me, myself, and just work with simple natural sounds. From time to time I had some electronicia, some simple sine waves and simple elements, like little noises, but these are just things that in electronic music are considered a simple thing, a sine wave. These are things you can also find in the works of Stockhausen or Xenakis, basically in the pioneers of electronic music. So we are not talking about synthesisers or computers but more about tapes. So I just decided to change and I\u2019m ok with this decision really.\nInnerversitysound:In interviews you have mentioned a wide range of influences from industrial, indie pop, German electronic music, drum and bass, ambient, and the ethereal electronic pop of your teenage years. The early band of yours Antennah, what was the ideas that drove you and your friend Valentinno Murru?\nStefano: When I was a child I was playing the organ and when I was a teenager I discovered New Wave bands, Joy Division and that kind of stuff from about 1986. So my decision was to buy a bass, I was a bass player and we just formed this band. We just wanted to make something new, quite na\u00efve. It was great but after about five years I just wanted to make something else and this electronic music thing in me started when I was very young I had this computer in my house and I started programming this computer to make simple sounds and to play by pressing the keys of the keyboard while I was playing the organ. So I was tweaking a home computer to make some sounds and noises and this was my very first approach to electronic music. So after I was in a band for five years, playing the bass, I felt a real need, an urgency to widen my palette of sounds so I decided to leave them and start making electronic music. From 1992 until 2006 I was making electronic music.\nThe last thing I did, apart from the Waves on Canvas project was a collection of remixes for Kirsten Hersch, the singer for Throwing Muses, because in a period around 2006-7 she was recording the tracks of her new album and releasing the tracks of the songs on the web. So I was just taking the vocal parts and doing the rest, a brand new arrangement with new chords, new tonal centre. Just then I was just starting to think differently about electronic music. So this is just my background, I was taught classical music, I played bass in a band but in the meantime I was still tweaking my computer at home, I embraced electronic music, but now it is like being back home again. Just being what I was when I started making music when I was a child.\nInnerversitysound: So the immediate reception of At Home Piano Book (Volume One) on Home Normal was decisive in its endorsement of your new approach to music. Can you tell us a bit about this album and how the collaboration with Ian Hawgood came about?\nStefano: Basically I started making these little compositions on the piano, they were just little ideas. I sat at the piano when I had ideas and if I felt they were interesting I just recorded the scratch idea on the iPad. So then I started to compose them properly with a kind of structure and my idea was to make a collection of piano impressions, like little water colours, something like that. Nothing too serious. I sent a few of those tracks to Ian, about 5 years back and he was really into those tracks. Then we started emailing and I felt quite lucky, because when you have a label like Home Normal, which is kind of busy, there are a lot of people sending stuff, I felt lucky anyway. And then we became friends. Of course there is a mutual friendship now between the artist and the label as well. I wanted to keep that feeling of playing in a room, a very simple thing.\nInnerversitysound: You are incorporating minimal electronic touches and processing. Has it receded so far into the background that it may eventually disappear? Or has the impression of the knowledge gained by exposure to these forms indelibly informed your composition of classic forms?\nStefano: There is a future release that will be out in September that is based on a work of a friend of mine who makes paintings and cartoons as well. He was living in Japan for about 9 years, he worked with Sakamoto, designed a Swatch and he made this last book about his memories in Japan. I was really inspired by his latest work because I love Japanese culture as well and then I wrote and produced this new album called Japanese Notebooks. It features some electronicia, but very subtle, there is also some in Leaf. It is just a little colour and nothing that characterises too much the overall sound. What I still like about elements that come from electronic are the sub-basses and that round warm feeling. And that is just from a simple sine wave, a regular oscillation of a wave. Yes there is still electronic music but very few and just in a very delicate measure. I am planning to use some electronic elements like arpeggios of simple waves to be a part of an arrangement in the future. I am thinking about this idea but mostly it is just acoustic music. I don\u2019t want to be a second hand Max Richter or things like that because mostly I am still exploring and looking for a language of mine of course for otherwise it would not be very useful to be out there and be a clone of someone.\nInnerversitysound: You formed an ensemble which is a change from the solitary electronic musician. It involves a good deal more interpersonal communication. How did forming this ensemble come about and can you tell us a bit about the dynamics of working with 3 other people in an ensemble has changed your practice?\nStefano: If you make electronic music for instance, you have a very immediate response to what you are doing because you are just playing sounds with a machine. You have got those sounds, just suddenly. When you score, when you write music on a score, yes you can make sounds to make a sort of pre-production of what you have in mind. But then again when you play with real players it will sound different again. So it\u2019s really exciting and interesting because a player is not a machine and he will play differently every time and it will depend on how tired he is from his feeling of the day; a lot of variations can happen and anyway real instruments forever change. Yes the real feeling is in the score but the overall feeling of the track can change of course. This is something that fascinates me a lot because we are humans, we are faulty humans by nature so it\u2019s great to transpose this aspect into music. We are not talking about recorded music that will sound the same every time you play it to your friends but music that will change every time and it\u2019s great. I love this, I really need this aspect from music to be alive, in a way.\nInnerversitysound: In Quiet Fracture on the Leaf album is the most sound designed piece of the recent few albums. Is this interlude kind of thing going to happen more often or was it something that just occurred in the making of the album.\nStefano: Yes, Leaf, it\u2019s an album of that started when my father started being ill. And my father now has a very serious illness. And this illness was showing by some very strange events like from time to time he was falling but we underestimated what was happening. Quiet Fracture is about something that is very slowly starts to go, in this case it was my father, and then shows in itself completely. So there are some steps and some laughter from a few women. This is quite symbolistic about something that starts to show inside and then grows as a big laughter. Yes that album it is written, \u2018from my father, to my father\u2019 and it was a very bad time and for some reasons it still is. It\u2019s quite personal to be honest.\nInnerversitysound: In reading background material about what you do I stopped at you commenting that you had adopted a very simple attitude towards life and music generally. If you could elaborate on this turn to simplicity and its effects on the whole of what you do in life.\nStefano: Simplicity, simple things, it is a value that I make mine a lot. For instance my decision to move on from electronic music to apparently more simple music. Like the title Leaf, it is just a small green element that we see on the side of the road, in the trees, but if you move your attention to the inner structure of the leaf, in this structure you see a lot of little path roads and this is a clear symptom that simplicity shows us a different world if you take the right pathways and if you approach simplicity with the right attitude. I have been doing Zen meditation for about 10 years in my life so I am really attached to a simple approach to life which is not a basic approach. It is just simple because then by embracing simplicity you can embrace the complexity of life as well. So it is something very connected. Like for instance when I was making electronic music I had complexity at hand very easy because of sounds, because of all those electronic elaborations on sounds as well. But to me it wasn\u2019t that interesting anymore. But if you use just simple sounds and you give them the proper attention to the inner structure of a simple acoustic sound, it has a lot of things that change every time. Like if you struck a note on the piano and every time it will resonate differently and this is apparently a simple sound which it definitely is not. This is an example of simplicity not being simple at all. Simplicity being a great and a good example of the complexity of life itself. Because simple things to me are just the first side of the real complexity of life.\nInnerversitysound: Your album Japanese Notebooks is slated for later this year. Is it completed yet, or is it still in production or in Ian Hawgood\u2019s very long cue for mastering?\nStefano: The album is just finished, mixed and mastered. I finished it in January and I am leaving it to \u2018take the dust\u2019 for 4 to 5 months and then I will listen to it again to fix a few things with fresh ears and a fresh mind because you have to take the distance from things at a certain point. Possibly, I don\u2019t know yet, I will ask someone to master it. I still have to decide. I usually master things myself, I am very much of a DIY person, and I really love this attitude. I do almost everything about my job; like promoting, producing, I have my own label as well, Stella Recordings, for my stuff, so it\u2019s really important for me to have most of the things under my control. I rarely work with people, one of these ones is Ian because I really trust him, we are friends, but I really trust Ian and his approach to music. So this album is basically finished, I just have to fix a few things here and there. But that\u2019s it really.\nInnerversitysound: In terms of ambitions, or strategies when this simplicity gets a bit tricky and demanding. Have you an escape plan lined up?\nStefano: My escape plan is that I will always have to be honest with myself and correct about what I am doing at the moment. And when all of this won\u2019t work anymore I will ask myself what is happening and if I won\u2019t have any reply for myself, I always tell myself and to my future wife as well, maybe I will stop making music as well. I hate the idea of riding the wave of what is going on at the moment because I wouldn\u2019t be honest to myself and mostly I would be wasting my time. Because it is not written anywhere in the sky that I have to make music. Maybe there will be a time when I just have to stop, or maybe not. I don\u2019 know. But what I know is that my only escape is just to be honest with myself and ask myself directly what\u2019s happening and add a proper reply, never be negative or positive. I hope positive.\nLeaf is out now on Stella Recordings and digitally on Home Normal.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T10:30:46Z", "url": "https://www.cyclicdefrost.com/2016/04/stefano-guzzetti-by-embracing-simplicity-you-can-embrace-the-complexity-of-life-interview-by-innerversity-sound/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Becoming a professional coach is one of the most rewarding jobs I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s such an honor to be able to help people grow in their personal leadership skills and pursue their true purpose and passions to make a huge impact in the world. I love facilitating \u201ca-ha moments\u201d for people and guiding them towards success. I never thought I would become a coach because I didn\u2019t even know that the coaching industry existed until about 3 years ago. Since then, I learned more about it, volunteered and practiced it as much as I could, and took steps to call this my career. Today, I wanted to answer some FAQs for people who are interested in becoming a coach or adding coaching skills to their repertoire. As you read this, imagine us chatting together at a coffee shop with the freedom for you to pick my brain. My hope is that this gives you more insight to the industry and provides a little bit of direction of your next steps.\nQ: I love helping people. I\u2019ve always enjoyed mentoring and guiding younger people. Is coaching right for me? A: Yes! The heart of coaching is helping people to figure out what they want, why they want it, and provide the support and accountability for them to be successful. When you get down to it, a coach sees someone for their potential and equips them with the skills and resources for them to be the best version of themselves. A coach is someone who wants to facilitate change, growth, and get people from where they are now to where they want to be. It\u2019s definitely considered to be a \u201chelping profession.\u201d It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be with someone younger than you, but people tend to work with coaches that they can relate to. The question to ask yourself is, \u201cWHY do you want to become a coach?\u201d Get clear on your definition of success. If it\u2019s genuinely to help people get better in a motivating way, then coaching may be a good fit for you.\nQ: What are my options as a coach? // What can I do as a coach? A: There are many paths you can take, or make yourself! Typically you could: be to go-to coach for your current company, be a coach that consults for other companies, or start your own private coaching business/practice. There are many different niches as well: including health/wellness, business, life, executive, leadership and success, and career. Or, you could get coach training for basic coach skills (communication, listening, asking questions, goal-setting/accountability) that could equip you to be a better leader in your current job.\nQ: How can I get started with coaching? A: Start Where You Are! First, if you\u2019ve never experienced working with a coach yourself, I highly encouraged you to do it. That way, you know first-hand what it\u2019s all about. You can go to local workshops and seminars hosted by a coach, or invest in working with one yourself. Then, the best way to see if coaching is right for you as a career is to engage in opportunities to learn and practice coaching. Find people and opportunities where you can offer your listening ear and expertise. If you're working 9-5, what are some ways you can add value to your company by helping others grow? For example, it could be a book club, speaking in a professional development series, or creating an accountability group. The key is to find practical ways to practice (even if it\u2019s on your friends!) Think of it as an experiment: Who do I love to help? What kind of problems are they dealing with? What value am I providing them? Do I even like this?\nSomething you can try to practice with people one-on-one: create a survey asking questions about people\u2019s needs and desires, send it out to friends and people in your network, and offer a mini-coaching session to those who have filled it out. This gives you a better idea of what people need and are looking for, and also real-world experience in coaching people.\nQ: Do I need training or certification? A: Getting training is like the difference between between street smart and and school smart. You may naturally have great coaching skills, but training hones them to take to the next level. I like to think of it like the difference between a street basketball player and a professional one. A street basketball player is naturally skilled and may have fun playing the game, but when you\u2019re ready to go pro, training helps provide structure and expertise, and confidence in helping you know what you\u2019re doing. Coach training is an investment and can range from $500-$2000 per module (and even up to $10,000 for the whole shebang), so carefully consider it before going all in. I went to Erickson International, and have heard good things about Co-Active Coach Training, and Lifeforming.\nCertification is getting officially registered by the International Coach Federation. You need to have at coach training and at least 100 hours in order to apply. It\u2019s a great route to consider if you value professional development, and a must-have if you want to work for corporate companies for executive/leadership coaching. A lot of corporate companies will only hire coaches with those credentials. But if you worked with clients one-on-one in your own private practice, it\u2019s not necessary. Keep in mind that clients buy for results. As long as you provide value and results, clients will be happy to work with you.\nBuilding a business takes a lot of time and persistence. It\u2019s one thing to be a great coach but it\u2019s another thing to be a great business owner. It takes a lot of focused intention and attention, and it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. I always say that building a business is the BEST personal development because you\u2019re always learning new things (that constantly keep changing) and pushing yourself to grow.\nPeople don\u2019t buy coaching, they buy results. This is a marketing thing. To more clear you are about who you help and how you help them, they better chance you\u2019ll find the people you\u2019re meant to serve and get paying clients. I naively thought that saying \u201cI can coach!\u201d would attract people to me. Instead, I had to learn some savvy marketing skills and get clear on my audience, message, and services.\nThings are constantly changing. Things within the industry are constantly changing. The coach I was one year ago is way different than the coach I am today (for the better!) Business is the same way. Things that worked before may not worked now. So I\u2019m constantly experimenting with new marketing channels and offerings. I like the challenge of trying new things, but I\u2019m also balancing it with trying to remain consistent in things like my voice and helpful habits.\nInvest in things that matter. Some people may think the only expenses needed for an online coaching business is a laptop, internet, and a phone (which you already have). But realistically, start-up costs could be education, training, web site/marketing materials/branding, office supplies, legal fees, etc. Those things add up. It\u2019s good to have a budget to set aside money to invest in things to matter to you. For me, that was education, branding, and working with a coach.\nQ: What are your favorite books/resources? A: I love reading! Here\u2019s a list of my recommended books for leadership, business, and creativity. I continue to add to the list, so let me know what your recommendations are!\nI hope this Q+A session helped you get a better peek into our world and give you clarity for the direction of your coach journey. My vision is that someday coaching will become more mainstreamed and that everyone would be equipped with basic coaching skills. Wouldn\u2019t that be AWESOME?!\nLeave your comments or questions below and SHARE the love on your favorite social media channels!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T11:00:54Z", "url": "http://shichencoaching.com/blog/so-you-wanna-be-a-coach", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Residential buildings account for a significant amount of the national energy consumption of all OECD countries and consequently the EU and the Netherlands. Therefore, the national targets for CO2 reduction should include provisions for a more energy efficient building stock for all EU member states.\nNational and European level policies the past decades have improved the quality of the building stock by setting stricter standards on the external envelope of newly made buildings, the efficiency of the mechanical and heating components, the renovation practices and by establishing an energy labelling system. Energy related occupancy behavior is a significant part, and relatively unchartered, of buildings\u2019 energy consumption. This thesis tried to contribute to the understanding of the role of the occupant related to the energy consumption of residential buildings by means of simulations and experimental data obtained by an extensive measurement campaign.\nThe first part of this thesis was based on dynamic building simulations in combination with a Monte Carlo statistical analysis, which tried to shed light to the most influential parameters, including occupancy related ones, that affect the energy consumption and comfort (a factor that is believed to be integral to the energy related behavior of people in buildings). The reference building that was used for the simulations was the TU Delft Concept House that was built for the purposes of the European project SusLab NWE. The concept house was simulated as an A energy label (very efficient) and F label (very inefficient) dwelling and with three different heating systems.\nThe analysis revealed that if behavioral parameters are not taken into account, the most critical parameters affecting heating consumption are the window U value, window g value, and wall conductivity. When the uncertainty of these parameters increases, the impact of the wall conductivity on heating consumption increases considerably. The most important finding was that when behavioral parameters like thermostat use and ventilation flow rate are added to the analysis, they dwarf the importance of the building parameters in relation to the energy consumption. For the thermal comfort (the PMV index was used as the established model for measuring indoor thermal comfort) the most influential parameters were found to be metabolic activity and clothing, while the thermostat had a secondary impact.\nThe simulations were followed by an extensive measurement campaign where an in-situ, non-intrusive, wireless sensor system was installed in 32, social housing, residential dwellings in the area of Den Haag. This sensor system was transmitting quantitative data such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, and motion every five minutes for a period of six months (the heating period between November to April) and from every room of the 32 dwellings that participated in the campaign. Furthermore, subjective data were gathered during an initial inspection during the installation of the sensor system, concerning the building envelope, the heating and ventilation systems of the dwellings. More importantly though, subjective data were gathered related to the indoor comfort of the occupants with the use of an apparatus that was developed specifically for the SusLab project. This gimmick, named the comfort dial, allowed us to capture data such as the occupants\u2019 comfort level in the PMV 7 point scale. In addition further comfort related data like the occupants\u2019 clothing ensemble, actions related to thermal comfort, and their metabolic activity were captured with the use of a diary. The subjective data measurement session lasted for a week for each dwelling. These data were time coupled real time with the quantitative data that were gathered by the sensor system.\nThe data analysis focused on the two available indoor thermal comfort models, Fanger\u2019s PMV index and the adaptive model. Concerning the PMV model the analysis showed that while the neutral temperatures are well predicted by the PMV method, the cold and warm sensations are not. It appears that tenants reported (on a statistically significant way) comfortable sensations while the PMV method does not predict such comfort. This indicates a certain level of psychological adaptation to occupant\u2019s expectations. Additionally it was found that although clothing and metabolic activities were similar among tenants of houses with different thermal quality, the neutral temperature was different. Specifically in houses with a good energy rating, the neutral temperature was higher than in houses with a poor rating.\nConcerning the adaptive model, which was developed as the answer to the discrepancies of Fanger\u2019s model related to naturally ventilated buildings (the majority of the residential sector), data analysis showed that while indoor temperatures are within the adaptive model\u2019s comfort bandwidth, occupants often reported comfort sensations other than neutral. In addition, when indoor temperatures were below the comfort bandwidth, tenants often reported that they felt \u2018neutral\u2019. The adaptive model could overestimate as well as underestimate the occupant\u2019s adaptive capacity towards thermal comfort. Despite the significant outdoors temperature variation, the indoor temperature of the dwellings, as well as the clothing of the tenants, were largely constant. Certain actions towards thermal comfort such as \u2018turning the thermostat up\u2019 were taking place while tenants were reporting thermal sensation \u2018neutral\u2019 or \u2018a bit warm\u2019. This indicates that either there is an indiscrimination among the various thermal sensation levels or alliesthesia, a new concept introduced by the creators of the adaptive model, plays an increased role. Most importantly there was an uncertainty on whether the neutral sensation means at the same time comfortable sensation while many actions are happening out of habit and not in order to improve one\u2019s thermal comfort. A chi\u00b2 analysis showed that only six actions were correlated to thermal sensation in thermally poorly efficient dwellings, and six in thermally efficient dwellings.\nFinally, the abundance of data collected during the measurement campaign led the last piece of research of this thesis to data mining and pattern recognition analysis. Since the introduction of computers, the way research is performed has changed significantly. Huge amounts of data can be gathered and handled by evermore faster computers; the analysis of these data a couple of decades ago would take years.\nSequential pattern mining reveals frequently occurring patterns from time-ordered input streams of data. A great deal of nature behaves in a periodic manner and these strong periodic elements of our environment have led people to adopt periodic behavior in many aspects of their lives such as the time they wake up in the morning, the daily working hours, the weekend days off, the weekly sports practice. These periodic interactions could extend in various aspects of our lives including the relationship of people with their home thermal environment. Repetitive behavioural actions in sensor rich environments, such as the dwellings of the measurement campaign, can be observed and categorized into patterns. These discoveries could form the basis of a model of tenant behaviour that could lead to a self-learning automation strategy or better occupancy data to be used for better predictions of building simulating software such as Energy+ or ESP-r and others.\nThe analysis revealed various patterns of behaviour; indicatively 59% of the dwellings during the morning hours (7-9 a.m.) were increasing their indoor temperature from 20 oC< T< 22 oC to T> 22oC or that the tenants of 56% of the dwellings were finding the temperature 20 oC< T< 22 oC to be a bit cool and even for temperatures above 22 oC they were having a warm shower leading to the suspicion that a warm shower is a routine action not related to thermal comfort.\nSuch pattern recognition algorithms can be more effective in the era of mobile internet, which allows the capturing of huge amounts of data. Increased computational power can analyse these data and define useful patterns of behaviour that could be tailor made for each dwelling, for each room of a dwelling, even for each individual of a dwelling. The occupants could then have an overview of their most common behavioural patterns, see which ones are energy consuming, which ones are related to comfort and which are redundant, and therefore, could be discarded leading to energy savings. In any case the balance between indoor comfort and energy consumption will be the final factor that would lead the occupant to decide on a customised model of his indoor environment.\nThe general conclusion of this thesis is that the effect of energy related occupancy behaviour on the energy consumption of dwellings should not be statistically defined for large groups of population. There are so many different types of people inhabiting so many different types of dwellings that embarking in such a task would be a considerable waste of time and resources.\nThe future in understanding the energy related occupancy behaviour, and therefore using it towards a more sustainable built environment, lies in the advances of sensor technology, big data gathering, and machine learning. Technology will enable us to move from big population models to tailor made solutions designed for each individual occupant.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T16:45:14Z", "url": "https://journals.open.tudelft.nl/index.php/abe/issue/view/627", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Over last weekend while I was reading the newspaper, I came across an article by Janice Tay, a freelance writer, who was studying in a Japanese language school in Kyoto. It was time for her and her classmates to graduate and time for them to bid Sayoranara to each other. They had been in Kyoto for a year and a half and some of them had grown so attach to each other that it was hard for some of them to say goodbye. I believe that most of us would be able to relate to what they felt as we had already gone through similar experience in our lives.\nThey were having a farewell party at the pub and everyone was drinking and catching up for the last time before going their separate way. It had gone to a point whereby some were getting emotional and were weeping. In that moment, someone said, \u201cDon\u2019t cry \u2013 everyone will be friends forever.\u201d Yes. That is true to certain extent and only for a few. I particularly agree with the author\u2019s point of view that \u2018keeping in touch with someone you can\u2019t see and hear takes energy and imagination that few have.\u2018 If you and the person you are keeping in touch with believe in this. There will be a good chance to be friends forever. Otherwise, one will find it challenging even to find time to send an email. Friends forever \u2013 it is possible when both sides make time and effort plus a right portion of expectation. In fact, what is being said here can be applied to most relationships. In order to make a relationship work, it takes a good amount of communication but you will need to find time and to put in the effort to communicate in the first place.\nWell, the key thing in the article that caught my attention was not how to be friends forever but rather in a statement that Janice wrote \u2018You can\u2019t take today with you.\u2018 What immediately came across my mind when I was reading it is that the statement makes a lot of positive sense. It reminds me of a quotation by Helen Keller.\nHow often have you come across someone who told you that he/she had just broken up? Most initial response will be, \u201cYou will find someone new.\u201d And isn\u2019t that true for most people \u2026 eventually? The ones that never found someone new, most probably they never allowed themselves to start looking again after they went through the unhappy relationship.\nFor one who believes that thing always happened for a reason, one will not have any challenges of moving on. You may ask me, \u201cFor what reason it happened?\u201d What I can say is that we may not always see the reason immediately when it happened but when we do, it will be like \u201cAhem, so that\u2019s why!\u201d And sometimes we may not even realise the reason.\nWe can\u2019t take today with us \u2026 so we have to continue to move forward with the faith that tomorrow will be better and a lot of times, it really depends on ourselves to make tomorrow better. I wish goodness in everyday of your life and that you will have the courage to move forward fearlessly.\nWell said. Why do we only think about the good ol\u2019 memories when a relationship end?\nShouldn\u2019t we be dwelling on the parts that hurt the most in it which brings us to the ending?\nHuman minds are strange in selecting only the good things to remember at the wrong time.\nWell BK, I must say that you must be really inspired these days to come up with such a moving journal.\nAnyway,I definitely agree that one should let go of the past, especially the ones that brought them excruciating experience (pain). However, the lesson it brought that person should be kept forever, thus giving him/her the opportunity to use them as he /she goes forward in his/her life.\nNo matter how painful a situation can be, at the end of the road, a ray of light is waiting to be caught. So, always look at the brighter side of every situation!\nIt\u2019s the art of letting go. Very nice article. I will dig it.\nThe answer was \u2018No\u2019 naturally. Exactly! In order for you to put another glass of water at the same corner, the first glass of water must be removed. The same applies. I agree with you totally that lessons must be learnt from the past experience.\nVery true. It is not always easy to live in the now. One is constantly thinking of yesterday or tomorrow. When only TODAY counts. Like your blog.\nyour attitude and choices of the past.\nthe choices you make today!\nThat will make a difference tomorrow!\nHi Nihal, you are definitely right, we have \u201conly one life chance\u201d to live.\nI love this post. It\u2019s just so true.\nI especially liked your question about how you would play the game if you knew that by putting in 100% you would win.\nYour attitude can truly make you or break you.\nJane @ Kidzaramas last blog post..Do You Get Dressed Up To Go Out?\nExcellent post BK\u2026you only get one today\u2026so making the most of it & watching out for those \u201copen doors\u201d makes all the difference \ud83d\ude42 Hanging onto things that can\u2019t be saved doesn\u2019t do much good for anyone.\n@ Shawie, the art of detachment is truly a challenge to learn and yet it gives us freedom.\n@ Chelle, you are right; hanging onto things that can\u2019t be saved doesn\u2019t do much good for anyone and yet it is such a challenge for a lot of people to learn to let go and move on; Just as water left a trail wherever it passed.\nTinas last blog post..HOW DO YOU THINK MAN WAS MADE?\nvery well written and totally agree with you.\nOne chance, truly. Great writing.\nStefans last blog post..Is the lifestyle in America too convenient?\nI had to swallow real big on this one. What a beautiful post. wow\u2026for me, I just need to read this over and over and over again. I guess that is what time is for.\nThank you for such a truly heartfelt post.\n@ Cricket, when I first read the article, I felt a big knock on my head and the bell seemed to be ringing. Some may call it enlightenment. However, it makes so much sense to me that the thought starts to flow in my mind and eventually this article. Thank you for enjoying this post and hope that you might help you in ways it did for me.\nwow BK! you\u2019re so inspired huh!\nit\u2019s so true about relationships. i\u2019ve tried communicating again with old friends with the hope of reviving old friendships, but it seems some are leading and living different lives. but there are few who are still the same old friends i\u2019ve known even without constant communication.\n@ Cricket, glad that it did. Have a great weekend!\nThat was a great post \u2013 really enjoyed the reminder!\ndang! i am so stupid! im sorry bk, i thought you were a lady. \ud83d\ude41 i hope you\u2019ll forgive me.\n@ Fashion Forward, it is simple truth and yet very challenging in action. Very often people are unwilling to let it go. Letting go is something we all need to do. It will take practice.\nI\u2019ve moved a lot in my adult life. And I\u2019ve asked myself those same kinds of questions. Is there really a point to keeping up with someone that you can\u2019t see or spend time with. I\u2019ve definitely come to the conclusion that when one door seems like it\u2019s closing, trying to hold it open is the wrong way to go.\n@ Ben, much as we must not be ever ready to give up without a fight, we must know when to let go when holding on is doing more harm to us. The challenge is always knowing when to fight and when to let go.\n.-= rainboy\u00b4s last blog ..Happy Birthday \ud83d\ude00 =-.\nI guess it is alright to be caught up in the moment and wail about being apart and all, for it is the only way to really show that our friends really matter and have been a big part of our lives. However people tend to cling on to those memories for too long at times that they do more harm than good.

{"text": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T15:06:59Z", "url": "https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1093161_electric-motorcycle-road-trip-what-i-learned-what-you-need-to-know", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Mark Frigon is a senior product manager with IBM\u2019s Enterprise Marketing Management organization, a key group involved in leading IBM\u2019s Smarter Commerce initiative. Mark\u2019s specialties are in Web analytics (he joined IBM as part of its acquisition of Coremetrics) and Internet privacy, an issue that has come to the forefront in recent years for digital marketers around the globe.\nEffective Web metrics are critical to the success of businesses looking to succeed in e-commerce and digital marketing these days, and IBM has a number of experts who spend a lot of their time in this area.\nOne of those here in Madrid at the IBM Smarter Commerce Global Summit, Mark Frigon, is a senior product manager for Web analytics in IBM\u2019s Enterprise Marketing Management organization.\nMark sat down with me to discuss the changing nature of Web analytics, and how dramatically it has evolved as a discipline over the past few years, including the increased focus by marketers on \u201cattribution,\u201d the ability to directly correlate a Web marketing action and the desired result.\nMark also spoke at the event about the importance for digital marketers around the globe to be more privacy-aware, a topic we also discussed in our time together, calling out in particular the \u201cDo-Not-Track\u201d industry self-regulatory effort that intends to put privacy controls in the hands of consumers.\nIf you spend any time thinking about Internet privacy or Web analytics, or both, this is a conversation you won\u2019t want to miss.\nRemember that team of blackjack-playing cohorts from MIT in the book (and, later, movie) \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d who fleeced a number of Vegas casinos before they were invited never to grace their gambling doors again?\nIBM\u2019s Yuchun Lee explains to the IBM Smarter Commerce audience in Madrid how the company is doubling down on its investments in enterprise and social marketing management.\nWell, IBM executive and Unica co-founder Yuchung Lee was one of those who was asked not to come back. Permanently.\nWhich is okay by those of us at IBM, as we\u2019re keeping him way too busy to bother with card counting.\nInstead, Lee\u2019s mathematical prowess is being applied to help companies improve their marketing capabilities, a key ingredient in the IBM Smarter Commerce soup.\nAs Lee explained in his keynote session this afternoon here in Madrid, \u201cthis is the first time we\u2019re bringing together Coremetrics and Unica.\u201d He also highlighted the fact that out of the 1,700 participants here at the Summit, over 1,000 are marketeers!\nLee provided a broad overview of the Enterprise Marketing Management portfolio at IBM, explaining that \u201cwe\u2019ve shared progress as a group within IBM over the past year,\u201d sharing that also incorporates lessons learned from both the market and IBM customers.\nThe social buildout also incorporates enterprise analytics, tag management, and full mobile and social market capabilities that tie more closely together the marketing automation experience with the social realm.\nLee also debriefed quickly on two recent acquisitions, DemandTec, which expands IBM\u2019s EMM offerings with pricing, promotion, and product mix optimization, and Tealeaf, which rounds out IBM EMM solutions with customer experience management and analytics.\nAs Lee explained, \u201cA picture\u2019s worth a thousand words,\u201d and that\u2019s precisely what TeaLeaf provides, the ability to look at snapshots of individual user sessions to help determine where, exactly, it is that you\u2019re driving them crazy with your convoluted web experience!\nBut where Lee really \u201chooked\u201d the audience was in his observations about the Generation C customer, who is more connected and in control than ever! Did you know that 4 in 10 smartphone users search for an item in a store? Or that 77 percent of B2B buyers check with their peers before buying?\nWhich, he expanded, means that it must work more closely with other disciplines and functions, including merchandising, on- and offline sales, customer service, and even with IT.\nBut, Lee indicated, they can\u2019t stop there. Marketing must also share customer insights with other parts of the business so that all functions can benefit from these insights.\nFinally, they must extend that sharing of customer insights with other key stakeholders who can benefit: Partners, agencies, customer communities, and so forth.\nLee also explained that many organizations must adjust their marketing cultures to fully capitalize on the \u201cGeneration C\u201d (\u201cC\u201d for \u201cconnected\u201d) culture. They must build organizations that balance analytics and creative talents (easier said than done!), work with IT rather than around IT, and break down marketing siloes \u2014 digital and traditional marketing must consolidate and collaborate.\nFinally, accept mistakes and learn from them, and be agile enough to iterate and improve upon them. As even Lee can explain, there are only so many opportunities to double down in blackjack, and in business.\nThe enterprise marketing management opportunity vis-a-vis IBM\u2019s Smarter Commerce strategy is one of those rare opportunities.\nWell, that day of the year has finally arrived.\nThat day where we all slink into our offices after four nice, long, official holidays where (mostly, we hope) people stay away from their computers and mobile phones and tablets and God knows whatever other else connected devices just long enough to make it feel like you got some real rest (even though many of you were probably dealing with unrelated, but similarly frustrating, realities \u2014you know, like screaming kids and antagonizing in-laws).\nAnd all you could do was think about how nice it would be to come back into the nice peaceful and quiet office on Monday so you could get back to\u2026shopping.\nYes, boys and girls, cyber Monday has arrived.\nBut judging from the results of the IBM Coremetrics Benchmark Black Friday e-retailing analysis, you really need not worry about coming into the office anymore just so you can get yourself an extra slurp of broadband.\nThis is 2011, yo, all you gotta do is break out that iPad and you\u2019ll be standing in front of Macys women\u2019s wear or Best Buy\u2019s electronics section in seconds!\nBut while you\u2019re out there figuring out your Cyber Monday strategy, I\u2019m going to hit the highlights reel for the weekend in e-shopping.\nU.S shoppers apparently took great advantage of early sales this holiday, driving a 39.3 percent year-over-year increase in online Thanksgiving day spending while setting the stage for 24.3 percent online growth on Black Friday compared to the same period last year.\nConsumer spending increases. The aggressive shopping we witnessed on Thanksgiving Day this year carried over into Black Friday, with online sales increasing 24.3 percent annually.\nMobile Bargain Hunting. Black Friday also saw the arrival of the mobile deal seeker who embraced their devices as a research tool for both in-store and online bargains. Mobile traffic increased to 14.3 percent (compared to 5.6 percent last year).\nMobile Sales On the Getgo. Sales on mobile devices surged to 9.8 percent (a tripling from last year\u2019s 3.2 percent).\nApple\u2019s One Stop Shop. Mobile shopping was led by Apple, with the iPhone and iPad ranking one and two for consumers shopping on mobile devices (5.4 percent and 4.8 percent respectively). Together, the iPhone and iPad accounted for 10.2 percent of all online retail. Apparently, it ain\u2019t easy bein\u2019 an Android on Black Friday.\nThe iPad Factor. Shoppers using the iPad led to more retail purchases more often per visit than other mobile devices, leading one to wonder about the real estate to deal closing ratio. The bigger the device, the larger the average order value? Possibly, but this number can\u2019t lie: Conversion rates for the iPad were 4.6 percent, compared to 2.8 for all other mobile devices. The iPad was this weekend\u2019s e-shopping mobile king.\nSocial Influence. Shoppers referred from Social Networks generated 0.53 percent of all online sales on Black Friday, with Facebook leading the pack and accounting for a full 75 percent of all social network traffic.\nSocial Media Chit Chat. Boosted by a 110 percent increase in discussion volume compared to 2010, top discussion topics on social media sites immediately before Friday showed a focus on the part of consumers to share tips on how to avoid the rush. Topics included out-of-stock concerns, waiting times and parking, and a spike in positive sentiment around Cyber Monday sales.\nSurgical Shopping Goes Mobile: Mobile shoppers demonstrated a laser focus that surpassed that of other online shoppers with a 41.3 percent bounce rate on mobile devices versus online shopping rates of 33.1 percent.\nThis data came from findings of the IBM Coremetrics fourth annual Black Friday Benchmark, which tracks more than a million transactions a day, analyzing terabytes of raw data from 500 retailers nationwide.\nWith this data, IBM helps retailers better understand and respond to their customers \u2014 across the organization \u2014 improving sourcing, inventory management, marketing, sales, and services programs.\nYou can get more background on the study here.\nBlack Friday: U.S. Online Retail Up 20% Year-Over-Year!\nI had absolutely nothing to do with shopping today, online or off. But I seemed to have been a minority, and for those retailers looking to the holiday season to help bolster an otherwise anemic year, they will be excited by the news delivered today by the IBM Coremetrics e-retailing Black Friday Benchmark Report.\nNo flies on those guys! Apparently they were too busy counting everyone else\u2019s clicks to pursue any of their own.\nClick image to enlarge. Black Friday e-retail sales in U.S. were up 20% over the same period last year, with consumers turning to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for their e-shopping efforts more than they ever have.\nE-retail sales at major online retailers were up 20 percent as of 3 P.M. EST this afternoon, compared to the same time on the Friday after Thanksgiving last year.\nThe survey monitors some 500 major U.S. Online retailers, and the 20 percent is in line with the 20 percent year-over-year increase IBM was reporting mid-day yesterday. However, apparently lots of folks are holding out until they\u2019ve allowed the turkey trytophan to kick in and the evening football games to start, because full-day online Thanksgiving sales ended 39 percent up over the holiday last year and they soared Thursday evening.\nMobile devices also played a much bigger role in online shopping this year, according to the benchmark. Shoppers are making 9.73 percent of their purchases from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, about the same as Thanksgiving day. And, as much as 17.37 percent of traffic to e-retail sites is coming from mobile devices, higher than even the 15.2 recorded yesterday.\nConsumer spending increased: Online sales were up a healthy 15.9 percent, with consumers pushing the average order value up from $170.19 to $190.80 for an increase of 12.1 percent.\nLuxury goods are making a comeback. Jewelry retailers reported a 17.6 percent increase in sales.\nSocial shopping. Consumers appear increasingly savvy about their favorite brands\u2019 social presence, and are turning to their social networking friends for information about deals and inventory levels.\nThough the percentage of visitors arriving from social sites is fairly small relative to all online visitors \u2014 nearly 1 percent \u2014 it\u2019s gaining momentum, with Facebook dominating the space.\nDepartment stores. They\u2019ve become the research engine of choice for consumers looking for Black Friday deals and product promotions. As a consequence, shoppers are spending 17.7 percent more time year over year on department store sites.\nHealth and Beauty. A reported rise of 73.1 percent in the number of new consumers completing their first purchase on their sites and a 53.4 percent jump in the number of visits in which consumers completed an order.\nIn-Store Sales for Consumer Electronics and Appliances. These are expected to increase 3.5 percent this year compared to last, with consumers spending a larger-than-usual share in November, according to an analytics-based forecast from IBM\u2019s Global Business Services division.\nU.S. consumers have been increasing their savings relative to disposable income, from 2 percent in 2007 to nearly 6 percent today, which has led to strong pent-up demand for consumer electronics and appliances, both of which are typically seen as necessities in today\u2019s economy.\nStay tuned here on the Turbo blog for other upcoming reports on the holiday season\u2019s retail tidings. It\u2019s still Black Friday, we still have the weekend, and Cyber Monday is a full three days away!\nThe weekend in sports proved to be as about as exciting as I had hoped.\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Darren Clarke became the third man from that region to win a golf major in 3 of the last 6, and it was Clarke\u2019s first British Open title.\nAnd as to the U.S. Women\u2019s soccer team, they played a nailbiter of a match, but in the end the team from Japan won on penalty kicks.\nMy hat goes off to both teams. I had a whole living room full of soccer fans, and we were all nervous wrecks up to that last penalty kick that gave Japan this year\u2019s World Cup trophy.\nStill, it was an awesome game all the way around, and I wish my friends in Japan a very happy celebration. They could probably stand some good news about now!\nLater today, IBM will announces its second quarter 2010 earnings. You can check the Investor Relations site for more details.\nOn the announcement front, today saw the introduction of a new cloud-based Web analytics and digital marketing suite intended to help organizations automate online marketing campaigns across their online channels, including web sites, social media networks, and even mobile phones.\nThe new offering combines the best of Coremetrics and Unica, and provides analytics that help companies better determine the effectiveness of new products and services, fine tune their marketing campaigns, and create personalized offers in real-time across channels.\nWith 64 percent of consumers making a first purchase because of a digital experience, it\u2019s critical that marketers understand online behavior and refine their marketing activities accordingly.\nSupports deep analysis into how customers interact with a brand over time and when each marketing program is the most effective.\nUsing this technology, businesses will be able to evaluate Facebook or Twitter activity, and offer customers tailored promotions delivered to their mobile devices on the fly.\nIBM\u2019s suite also enables businesses to deliver and fine tune digital marketing programs based on what customers are doing offline.\nFor example, a consumer who purchased a new tablet in a brick-and-mortar store would receive special offers via email to purchase tablet accessories.\nThe benefit to the customer is a consistent, relevant brand experience that reflects all of their online preferences, not just what they did, read or saw on one specific site.\nThe IBM Coremetrics Web Analytics and Digital Marketing Optimization Suite is the newest addition to IBM\u2019s family of Smarter Commerce solutions,which is focused on helping companies more effectively market, sell and secure greater customer loyalty in the era of social networking and mobile computing.\nSmarter Commerce transforms how companies manage and swiftly adapt to customer and industry trends across marketing, selling and service processes that span the entire commerce cycle, putting the customer at the center of their decisions and actions.\nTo learn more about this and other marketing solutions please visit the IBM Enterprise Marketing Management site.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T20:42:18Z", "url": "https://turbotodd.wordpress.com/tag/coremetrics/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "during our conversation it became apparent Jerome has developed a great approach to the sport, being backed by a good team, coupled with a dynamic fighting style, he is definitely one to watch.\n\u201cI started boxing when I was 21, so I started late, I just went to the gym with a friend, I had always watched boxing but never took that much of an interest in it.\nAfter I went to the gym once I got a feel for it, everything about it, the environment, the smell of the gym and from there it has catapulted, it became an obsession, it went from a hobby to a lifestyle.\n\u201cI had 35 fights, I won the Haringey box cup, I reached the national finals in 2016, I won London titles twice, so yeah, in the last two years I\u2019ve seen my amateur career take off.\n\u201cYou know what it is, I am a strong believer in timing, and at the age of 26 I wasn\u2019t going to gain much more from the amateurs, as in it might take me away from what I want to do as a pro.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve got guys at the IQ Boxing Gym in Neasden, North West London, my main coach is Xavier Miller, and my promoter is Steve Goodwin.

{"text": "Somnath Temple is one of the twelve jyotirlinga in India. Hindu worship Lord Shiva in the form of linga and all the Shiva Linga of jyotirlinga are famous as swayambhu. Swayambhu means that manifest on its own i.e. not made by man. These lingas are self-existing and appear suddenly or mysteriously without any human efforts. When the saints or holy men see them they install them in a temple. Each of the twelve jyotirlinga, take the name of a different manifestation of Shiva. These twelve jyotirlinga are considered very holy for the Shiva devotees. All the Shiva devotees visit these jyotirlinga one by one as all are located in different locations and can\u2019t be visited all at once. It is believed that just a visit to the temple is very auspicious and all bad deeds and sins are washed away in the feet of Lord Shiva.\nAmong all jyotirlinga, Somnath is considered as the first pilgrimage site. The Dwadash Jyotirlinga pilgrimage begins with the Somnath Temple. This temple is located in Prabhas Patan, in Saurashtra-Veraval in Gujarat. This temple is destroyed and rebuilt many times. This temple follows Triveni Sangam of three rivers- the Kapila, the Hiran and the auspicious river the Saraswati. It is believed that Somraj, the Moon God had built this temple out of Gold in Satyug, then it was re-built by Ravan in Silver in Tretayug, and again it was re-built by Lord Krishna in wood in Dwaparyug and finally in stone by Bhimdev Solanki in Kaliyug. Means this Somnath temple is from ancient times showering its eternal shrines and glory on the people. At last, it was rebuilt in 1951 in Chalukya style by the architecture of Hindu temple. The construction was proposed by Vallabhbhai Patel and was completed under the then head of the temple trust K.M. Munshi.\nMoon then came to Prabhasa also known as Somnath. He went on a penance for six months where he worshipped Lord Shiva to get out of his curse. His Jaap and Tap pleased Lord Shiva and he came to bless him. Lord Shiva told Moon that he can\u2019t be completely free from the curse but his gleams will appear different every day, 15 days it will grow and the next 15 days it will hide. To gain back his luster, he bathed in the River Sarasvati and the result is the waxing and waning of the moon, and is also referred to the waxing and waning of the tides at sea shore location. Lord Shiva himself came to be known as Someshwar which means famous moon (Soma).\nShravan Maas is considered very auspicious month to worship Lord Shiva and Somnath temple is famous not only as a jyotirlinga but also as a holy place where ones sins gets washed away. Visitors love the divine worship of Lord Shiva and its abhishek, aarti and the location of the temple.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T08:44:28Z", "url": "https://girlsglamour.in/somnath-temple/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "A good franchise lead questionnaire is going to produce quality leads, which is one responsibility of an effective sales VP. Such individuals aren\u2019t simply seeking to produce good leads, but leads which will be good franchisees down the line. Finding the right people is the difference between a good franchise operation and a great one.\nWhat interests you about our franchise?\nDo you have any debt? If so, how much and what kind? What is your plan for paying it off?\nAre partners involved in this? Does your spouse know? What are their details?\nWhere do you see yourself in 20 years and how does this franchise fit into that?\nWhat do you like about our franchise? Dislike?\nHow do you feel about our company culture?\nWhat sort of liquid cash can you acquire?\nWhen do you think you\u2019ll be profitable?\nGreat Franchise sales VP\u2019s know that the questionnaire only paints part of the picture. Consider To Sell Is Human; everybody sells themselves to some degree. Many who might not be a good fit for your brand will \u201csell\u201d themselves. So they look excellent on paper, but they\u2019re not the right fit for your brand when you meet them. Ideally, the questionnaire helps you to foster and generate genuine face-to-face or \u201cdiscovery\u201d meetings because there\u2019s a critical human element. The conversation \u201cfilter\u201d which you apply during the discovery interview will help determine the quality of this prospect\u2019s social fit. You can be creative with questionnaire structure to produce higher quality discovery meetings.\nHow do you qualify franchise leads before the discovery meeting? Maybe Chick-fil-A has the answer: They proactively scout leads which fit criteria in a given community and reach out directly. Their model is unique in the industry but commendable; they use deductive investigation to pre-qualify leads, which is likely why it\u2019s so hard to be a franchisee of this brand. Chick-fil-a scouts a community and figures out which member within that community will have the best long-term cultural fit. Then they help this potential franchisee bring a new Chick-fil-a to this new member\u2019s community.\nIf leads pass their rigorous community qualifications and all the standard franchisee qualifications to become part of the Chick-fil-A team, a store is built. Chick-fil-A is different in that they look for the human element first, and then follow with the questionnaire. As VP of sales, you can learn from this creative strategy.\nNo matter the size of a franchise group, it is critical that franchisees are only allowed to join if they are a \u201clow-risk investment\u201d. As much as they are investing in you, you\u2019re investing in them. Questions that reveal what type of person this lead might be in the future are essential. Cultural fit is crucial, but it won\u2019t matter if the lead does not qualify financially.\nStructuring questionnaires with existing data from previous interviews can help you reduce time, aggravation, and expense during the process. Some franchise software allows you to not only design questionnaires that help optimize the refining process, but establish actionable analytics.\nGood franchise project management (PM) tools allow you to keep all this information in one place as the lead transitions to partner or \u201cgoes sideways\u201d. This helps you identify trends you missed earlier and adjust and improve your questionnaires based on the information. Good PM tools will help make your questionnaires and process be much more effective.\nYou can also plan more effectively with Franchise PM Software. Such software allows you to determine with reasonable accuracy how much time it takes for you to transition a lead from one segment of the sales process to the next.\nFrequently, this process is so nebulous, franchisors are guessing with their gut. That can work--or blow up in your face\u2014it\u2019s far better to put numbers behind the process and reduce negative fallout.\nAnother prime feature of effective PM software involves email campaigns that strategically engage prospective franchisees based on analytics. If you want to maintain the investment value of the lead throughout your induction process, frequent communication is key.\nCompanies can use a portal like Franchise Gator, which matches their website design, to gather these questionnaires. However, portals can be expensive, typically charging $30-$50 per lead. As a result, many companies prefer to connect with leads through their website, trade shows, or by the lead calling the sales team directly. To avoid exorbitant portal feeds, make it easy for leads to reach out through your own website.\nTrade shows are cross-functional for lead generation. Not only are you at the trade show to connect with potential customers, but you can also be generating high-quality franchise leads. Trade shows are a more organic way to connect with franchise leads and to build trust. By being on panels, speaking and showing expertise you can show how your brand makes money for the entrepreneur; the prospective lead will be more willing to learn about the brand if you are striving to educate rather than to sell.\nWhen it comes to your franchise lead questionnaire, you can\u2019t cover everything. But you can continuously hone it so that with each new candidate, you\u2019ve got a more effective questionnaire and a better process. A paper questionnaire is half the puzzle. The human element is just as important. Acquired analytics are key in assisting you to secure the right leads. The right franchise PM software does a great deal to simplify and improve the process.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T00:22:43Z", "url": "https://synuma.com/blog/franchise-lead-questionnaire-guide", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Each year, there are more than 100,000 cases of pet poisoning in the U.S. Many of these were caused by household substances that may seem perfectly harmless to you. But just because something is safe for people doesn't mean it won\u2019t hurt beloved pets. Some of the most dangerous dog poisons are foods and medications we take on a daily basis.\nDepending on how a particular substance affects your dog\u2019s body and how much was ingested or inhaled, pet poisoning symptoms can include gastrointestinal and neurological problems, cardiac and respiratory distress, coma, and even death.\nDog poison No. 1: Prescription medications for people. Drugs that might be beneficial or even lifesaving for people can have the opposite effect in pets. And it doesn\u2019t always take a large dose to do major damage.\nPrescription anti-inflammatory and pain medications can cause stomach and intestinal ulcers or kidney failure.\nAntidepressants can cause vomiting and, in more serious instances, serotonin syndrome -- a dangerous condition that raises temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, and may cause seizures.\nDog poison No. 2: Insecticides.\nFlea and tick products. You may think you\u2019re doing your dog a favor when you apply products marketed to fight fleas and ticks, but thousands of animals are unintentionally poisoned by these products every year. Problems can occur if dogs accidentally ingest these products or if small dogs receive excessive amounts. Talk to your vet about safe OTC products.\nDog poison No. 3: Over-the-counter medications. This group contains acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen and naproxen (Advil, Alleve), as well as herbal and nutraceutical products (fish oil, joint supplements).\nDog poison No. 4: Pet medications. Just as we can be sickened or killed by medications intended to help us, cases of pet poisoning by veterinary drugs are not uncommon. Some of the more commonly reported problem medications include painkillers and de-wormers.\nDog poison No. 5: Household products, from cleaners to fire logs. Just as cleaners like bleach can poison people, they are also a leading cause of pet poisoning, resulting in stomach and respiratory tract problems. Not surprisingly, chemicals contained in antifreeze, paint thinner, and chemicals for pools also can act as dog poison. The pet poisoning symptoms they may produce include stomach upset, depression, chemical burns, renal failure and death.\nDog poison No. 6: People food. Your canine companion may look so cute as he sits there begging for a bite of your chocolate cake or a chip covered in guacamole, but not giving him what he wants could save his life. Animals have different metabolisms than people. Some foods, such as onions and garlic, as well as beverages that are perfectly safe for people can be dangerous, and sometimes fatal, for dogs.\nChocolate . Though not harmful to people, chocolate products contain substances called methylxanthines that can cause vomiting in small doses, and death if ingested in larger quantities. Darker chocolate contains more of these dangerous substances than do white or milk chocolate. The amount of chocolate that could result in death depends on the type of chocolate and the size of the dog. For smaller breeds, just half an ounce of baking chocolate can be fatal, while a larger dog might survive eating 4 ounces to 8 ounces, though 8 ounces would be extremely dagerous. Coffee and caffeine have similarly dangerous chemicals.\nAlcohol. Symptoms of alcohol poisoning in animals are similar to those in people, and may include vomiting, breathing problems, coma and, in severe cases, death.\nAvocado. You might think of them as healthy, but avocados have a substance called persin that can act as a dog poison, causing vomiting and diarrhea or worse.\nMacadamia nuts. Dogs may suffer from a series of symptoms, including weakness, overheating, and vomiting, after consumption of macadamia nuts.\nGrapes and raisins. Experts aren\u2019t sure why, but these fruits can induce kidney failure in dogs. Even a small number may cause problems in some dogs.\nXylitol. This sweetener is found in many products, including sugar-free gum and candy. It causes a rapid drop in blood sugar, resulting in weakness and seizures. Liver failure also has been reported in some dogs.\nDog poison No. 7: Chocolate. See above.\nAzaleas and rhododendrons. These pretty flowering plants contain toxins that may cause vomiting, diarrhea, coma, and potentially even death.\nTulips and daffodils. The bulbs of these plants may cause serious stomach problems, difficulty breathing, and increased heart rate.\nSago palms. Eating just a few seeds may be enough to cause vomiting, seizures, and liver failure.\nDog poison No. 9: Rodenticides, if ingested by dogs, can cause severe problems. The symptoms depend on the nature of the poison, and signs may not start for several days after consumption. In some instances, the dog may have eaten the poisoned rodent, and not been directly exposed to the toxin.\nDog poison No. 10: Lawn and garden products. Products for your lawn and garden may be poisonous to pets that ingest them.\nIf you think your dog has been poisoned, try to stay calm. It is important to act quickly, but rationally.\nFirst, gather up any of the potential poison that remains -- this may be helpful to your veterinarian and any outside experts who assist with the case. If your dog has vomited, collect the sample in case your veterinarian needs to see it.\nThen, try to keep your pet calm and call your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) at (888) 426-4435. Experts at the APCC are available to answer questions and provide guidance 24 hours a day for a $60 consultation fee. Another option is the Pet Poison Hotline with a fee of $59 per incident.\nKeep all medications, even those in child-proof bottles, in cabinets that are inaccessible to your dog. If you inadvertently drop a pill on the floor, be sure to look for it immediately. Supervise anyone, such as the elderly, who may need help taking medications.\nAlways follow guidelines on flea or tick products.\nAlthough you can safely give some ''people foods'' to your pet as a treat, others are toxic. If you have any questions about what is safe, ask your veterinarian. Or, err on the safe side and give treats made specifically for animals.\nBe sure any rodenticides you use are kept in metal cabinets or high on shelves where your pets can't find them. Remember that dogs can be fatally poisoned by eating an exposed rodent, so always be very cautious about using these products. Tell your neighbors if you put out rat bait, so they can protect their pets from exposure, and ask them to do the same for you.\nWhen buying plants for your home, opt for those that won\u2019t cause problems if your dog happens to nibble on them. The ASPCA has an online list of toxic and nontoxic plants by species. If you choose to have toxic plants, be sure they are kept in a place where your animals can't reach them.\nStore all chemicals and cleaners in pet-inaccessible areas of your home.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T04:44:47Z", "url": "https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/guide/top-10-dog-poisons", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "I was brimming with excitement all of Thursday. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about my date with Seabiscuit. I was very excited about his joining me at the theater plus the night adventures that would follow.\nI hurried home after work, took a quick shower, and headed out. It had been a warm day, and I was doubtful that I needed my jacket; however, then I remembered being cold at a previous performance in the evening. Even though I had checked the weather and saw Orinda was only predicted to be in the low 60s in the evening, I knew that up in the hills, where the theater is actually located, it can get much colder. I felt foolish carrying such a large jacket on BART and felt too warm to need it, but better safe than sorry.\nIt was good I did. By the time I arrived at the theater, it was significantly cooler. I was happy without a jacket but realized that once the sun finished setting, I would need to put it on. I waited for Seabiscuit to arrive, and was excited to see him clean-shaven\u2013as I had ordered as his Mistress. How good that he should obey so well! And he finally looked like one of his own photographs.\nI told him previously that he appeared to be a servant of the Many-Faced God because his face never seemed to match from one photograph to another. The angles were off or something seemed so strange about it. He didn\u2019t look like his photographs. I knew it was him, but how strange and different they all seemed.\nThere was a crowd, and I could tell he felt a bit shy. We hugged and kissed each other\u2019s cheeks, then held hands as we walked up the hill from Will Call to the theater.\nHe bought dinner for us at the caf\u00e9, and we continued holding hands. The line was long, and we really only had 10 minutes to eat before needing to be seated. He was impressed by my tickets and how close we were to the stage. The temperature had dropped significantly, so I put on my jacket when we were seated but he was astounded that I didn\u2019t close it until after intermission. I held his hand in his lap during the first half.\nDuring intermission, he rented a blanket while I used the restroom and got my free bag of Peet\u2019s coffee for renewing my subscription for the theater. We shared the blanket, and for the second half, he held my hand on my lap.\nThe performance was amazing, as all the shows I have seen there have been. CalShakes has done very well at selecting and directing plays that resonate with race issues going on currently, and this play was exceptionally well done in that regard. Seabiscuit enjoyed it greatly, and I told him he should return with me for all of next season. He said he would love to. It was his first time going to the theater in a very long time, and he said the final scenes with the bed on stage would linger in his memory for a long time.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T02:13:59Z", "url": "https://felicitasfortuna.com/2016/10/08/othello/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "As part of Living in Thailand, the Rice Field Project follows our journey of buying land, preparing it for building our house and finally building our house. This is part 34, to read the other parts click The Rice Field Project. If you are following this project then you might remember that we had an water well made at our land. Well as we will later build a guest bungalow on an other part of our land we had the idea to have a second water well made. The new one closer to our house and use the old one for the garden and guest-bungalow. But that did not go as easy as we thought.\nThe first try was about 5 meter from our house, they found water at 6 meter but not enough to pump it up. Second try was about 10 meter from the first water well. But no water at all was found. So a third try was done about 5 meter next to the first water well. And bingo .... water. And a lot of water.\nSo the location of the first water well was just sheer luck? Anyway we will see how it works out with 2 water wells near to each other. The job was done by the same 3 people of the first water well. And although they had to try 3 times, we only paid for 1 water well, 3.500 Thai baht + some tip for the hard work. Because yes it is hard work, especially at 30\u2103!\nUpdate : And we did just paid the final payment for the house construction.

{"text": "There are few moments in life this fast paced, that take you this much by surprise. Where after the adrenaline high, you can\u2019t believe it just happened to you. This is their story. Be sure to watch the video as well as browse through the photos as mom tells what happened from her perspective.\nBen\u2019s parents were already at the hospital for an induction. Last checked, she was 2 cm dilated and not in active labour at all. The induction medication hadn\u2019t even begun. I normally come when a client is in active labour as this early period could be slowed down by my presence. I texted with dad who told me we would touch base in an hour. I texted to see how things were going. Heard nothing for about 10 minutes and just had this gut feeling. I threw on my scrubs. My gear was already at the house and my childcare had been called in. I knew it would be today just not sure when.\nUtter disbelief. What was he talking about? She wasn\u2019t even in labour. This was a first baby. Complete as in completely dilated and at a 10? Maybe dad wasn\u2019t familiar with the terms.\nI put my keys in my pocket.\nI screamed at my childcare \u201cI gotta go, bye, I\u2019m walking out, you are on duty, bye\u201d and walked right to the car. I was driving away a minute later.\nThe drive had my heart pumping like never before. I knew this could go either way, some first time moms push for one to two hours so I might have time. Some deliver with in a couple pushes. I parked in exactly 20 minutes from when I walked out my door (went back and checked all my text time stamps).\nI ran up to maternity and heard a baby crying from a delivery room. My heart sank. I knew.\nHe was laying on her chest and it was the first natural birth that ever beat me to it!\nThis was a precipitous labor, which is defined as a labor that lasts no more than three hours from onset of regular contractions to delivery. Maybe you could call hers ultra-precipitous?\nThe room no less, was full of peace, and with in the first minute of being there I began shooting. The looks of disbelief and utter joy were plastered all over their faces.\nBen\u2019s parents have graciously allowed me to share their birth in part to glorify God publicly for his miraculous life. The images chosen, many that are not in the video, I selected almost all black and white because in this case, its just so visually stunning when laid together. In case you are wondering, my clients receive all of their images in colour and black & white for every session.\nTo Ben\u2019s parents, the joy and graciousness you carry exudes from a deep place of knowing truth. What a gift your son has in having you both to raise him. Thank you for hiring me. I\u2019m slightly terrified if you hire me again that I might just camp outside your house for a week.\nTo the hospital staff and Dr. Brandt at Netcare Blaauwberg Hospital, my sincerest thank you\u2019s for letting me run in all out of breath and document their day.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T13:21:10Z", "url": "https://blomerusphotography.com/2016/05/natural-birth-at-netcare-blaauwberg-ben-when-the-birth-photographer-missed-the-birth-cape-town-birth-photographer/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "I\u2019ve never understood the whole points thing, scholarships, etc. for open comps. I don\u2019t do enough open comps for it to matter \u2013 but I\u2019d love to understand it. I\u2019ve tried to look it up and other than the official rules which are like reading a law-book ( in other words make no sense to me!) I can\u2019t find a simple explanation of it all. If anyone can give a layperson\u2019s explanation it would be cool!\nI had to clarify. What to which \u201cpoints\u201d was she referring, exactly?\nMaybe you are referring to being top student or top teacher in a competition or a district or in a competition series? If that is the case, what happens is you get a certain amount of points for each entry you are in (or your instructor dances), and then more points for placing higher. Like when I got top student in San Diego it was like 8 points (or something, I don\u2019t exactly remember the point value) for 1st place, 6 for 2nd, down through 6th and then 1 point for participating. You get more points for participating more and for placing higher. Your instructor gets points for the same things, but obviously if they bring more students and dance more often, they earn more points.\nSo I checked it out, not being familiar with proficiency points. No one had ever mentioned them to me before.\nEllen, I\u2019ve looked at the proficiency point guide and I\u2019m intrigued. Seems to be a complicated system to determine which category you should dance in\u2026what age, what level, as an attempt in making sure people are competing at an appropriate level \u2013 not too high or too low. It says in the guide that USA dance will make a database online of the points so I\u2019m now trying to find that. I\u2019m curious to see where I might rank. I\u2019ve always been told that the instructor decides which category you dance at. It seems like the points might be more important for high level amateur competitors or professional couples. I\u2019ll ask Ivan about it, but who knows if he knows anything about it. It does say that you can be disciplined for dancing below your level! Thanks for asking this question. I love learning more about my favorite sport! I\u2019ll keep you updated.\nThe topic sparked my interest in a number of facets of ballroom dancing that involve points and I had a big \u2018ole conversation with Ivan about it after my lesson today.\nSadly, he didn\u2019t know about proficiency points, but he did comment on another type of points used by ballroom studios which I found intriguing. Also, I did a little more research and found on http://DanceForums.com some old comments about the proficiency points. You can see the comments I found here.\nFirst, the database is not current. I don\u2019t even know if you can find it. Someone who is on the USA Dance board must have been in the conversation because he or she commented that they needed someone to volunteer to keep up with the points. I guess you are supposed to keep track of them yourself! Well, I for one, haven\u2019t been doing that.\nSecond, the link Ellen sent me on the USA Dance page that directs you to the rules about the Proficiency points is outdated. I guess there have been changes (that a couple must now only accrue 200 points instead of the 300 mentioned in the pdf file) that aren\u2019t reflected in that edition of the rules.\nBut the plot thickens. These mystery proficiency points are only applicable to USA Dance sanctioned events.\nUSA Dance isn\u2019t the only governing body of ballroom dance.\nThere are different proficiency points and rules for the National Dance Council of America (NDCA) and the Youth College Network (YCN).\nSo there are points you accrue in competition. But after my conversation with Ivan, I have learned there are also points you can accrue at a studio. Now, I don\u2019t purport to have expertise in this area because I\u2019ve never danced in a ballroom dance franchise studio. I\u2019m going on what Ivan told me. If things are different, feel free to comment below and fill us all in. At least this is what I gather went on at Ivan\u2019s studio when he was employed by a franchised studio.\nStudents accrue points and have proficiency tests to determine what level they are at: pre-bronze, bronze, silver, etc. Then packages are sold around getting to the next level. Like for every lesson you take or every figure you learn it\u2019s recorded and there are charts of points and where you are. There are also charts proclaiming which student is which level, so you can compare yourself to other students and follow your and their progress.\nTo me, this seems a bit weird. I guess it is great for goal setting and is some form of monitoring progress, but just knowing the steps in the gold syllabus doesn\u2019t necessarily, I think, mean you are a gold level dancer \u2013 meaning that you might be dancing a gold step with bronze level technique.\nWhat it does do is give a person a sense of being able to put a feather in their cap. I\u2019ve had people ask me what level dancer I am, but since I have no points or proficiency tests to go on, I honestly don\u2019t know. I have no idea what level the steps I know are considered nor my level in terms of technique.\nSeems like another VCR manual to me, but at least this one only applies to amateurs. I still don\u2019t know what this means if I\u2019m dancing Pro/Am since my proficiency in Pro/Am shall not be used in determining my amateur proficiency level\u2026.though I don\u2019t dance Am/Am, myself!\nSheesh! I think it\u2019s an interesting topic, but still kind of a mystery even after all this writing and after all the various research!\nSo, now the ball is in your court. Do you know anything about points tracked in ballroom? What do you think of these point systems? Does your studio use them? How? Have you heard of them in the context of NDCA or USA Dance? Have you kept track of yours? What do they mean\u2026.really? I\u2019m curious to know.\nOoohhh, I\u2019m a bit nervous writing this post, but I think it is a very important subject that is not often talked about. It kind of relates to my previous post about when learning to dance that you make sure you find an instructor that can teach in a way that you can understand and process. And if it\u2019s not working out, to feel free to move on to a different instructor who can suit your needs. Sometimes that can be a little tricky. One of those situations where it is easier said, than done.\nThe topic I\u2019m talking about is whether or not as a dance student we are free agents, at liberty to dance with whichever instructor we desire and the sometimes-weird possessiveness that the instructor or studio may exhibit for his/her/its students.\nWhen it all boils down, I personally believe that I am the customer, I am the one paying to learn, and I should be able to go wherever I want to do that.\nHowever, it actually isn\u2019t as black and white as that. It isn\u2019t as easy to navigate as one might think.\nHopefully you can avoid some of the difficulties I\u2019ll mention by doing \u201cdancer-views\u201d before settling on a particular instructor. I plan to write a post later on about how to go about the process of finding and selecting an instructor, so I\u2019ll leave that for another time. However, even if you do your due diligence, it may not always be possible to stay with your current instructor indefinitely. Life happens. I\u2019m with my third instructor, and in both previous cases, there were life events that pushed that change along.\nBut for now (and for what I hope is a long, long time to come) as you know from the blog, my primary instructor is Ivan, who is an independent dance instructor. He is my #1. Any place I go to take group classes or whatever (unless it is just social dancing or I\u2019m not there enough for it to matter and it\u2019s none of their business) is aware of my instructor. Conversely, Ivan is aware that I take group classes at Inna\u2019s studio, and I often inform him if I go social dancing as well, out of courtesy.\nWith Ivan, he has made it clear that if I want to dance with other instructors for ballroom, then I need to not dance with him. Coaching would be a different situation, or a lesson with Marietta or Nona as a one time deal for styling or something would be fine too, and he\u2019d know about it.\nBut if I want to learn something that he doesn\u2019t have expertise in, like West Coast Swing, or Argentine Tango, then I just have to tell him my desire and he\u2019d be cool with that. That is the arrangement we have set up. But the point is, we had a conversation about it. At no point did I go behind his back and do things. I wouldn\u2019t want to risk losing him as an instructor. We have this agreement set up and I respect it.\nSomehow, however, I\u2019ve managed to be dancing at like three different places (sometimes more), but this is not, from what I\u2019ve heard, the \u201cnorm\u201d when it comes to ballroom dancing. And if you are going to go that road, it is extremely, extremely important to be respectful of the professionals at each location, as well as their students, and the relationships between them. It is extremely, extremely important to be upfront and clear on what relationship you have to each place you dance. Otherwise, things can get very messy, very quickly!\nFrom my past personal experience, and from that of others who have shared with me, some teachers and studios can become almost possessive of their students. I can even understand it, to a point. They want to protect their business and that only makes sense. However, I feel like it comes from a scarcity mindset \u2013 the idea that the instructor or studio has to keep the student away from any other dance influences for fear that the new or different dance instructor or class may \u201csteal\u201d the student away is focused on a fear of losing something. From my perspective, it isn\u2019t possible to steal a student. If you are providing the value a student is looking for, they won\u2019t go anywhere, no matter how many \u201cother\u201d group classes they take, or instructors they are exposed to. This would be an abundant mindset.\nBut the fact is, some of the studios just don\u2019t offer everything a person might be looking for. Not everyone offers Lindy Hop, or ballet. If I can\u2019t get those at my primary studio, and I want them, I should be at liberty to go elsewhere to find them. My primary studio can always take that as feedback and grow such areas if they so desire. But to prevent me, threaten me, or guilt me into not doing more dancing if I have that desire, I feel is poor behavior. To allow myself to let any threat, or guilt deter me from what I really want is not okay either.\nHowever, there is really something to be said for sticking with one instructor or studio when its good for you, even if it is tough. Sometimes there are issues to work through, even if you adore your instructor. I\u2019ve had a lesson or two with Ivan where we had to get clear on a few things and it wasn\u2019t necessarily comfortable. But I\u2019d choose being uncomfortable and having open, honest communication, than to lose a fab instructor any day of the week. That is just me.\nAgain, as mentioned in a previous post, there isn\u2019t necessarily one \u201cright\u201d way, the be-all and end-all way of dancing. That means that each instructor you learn from will give you some similar information, and some very different information than others. This can be very confusing and muddle the clarity of your dancing. A person has to be careful of not always thinking the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. It might be very green right where you are. Sticking it out with your instructor may be the best choice you ever make. Also, if you do decide to receive instruction from multiple sources, be aware that you may need to filter some of the information and make sure that you apply those things that will best serve you while leaving the rest behind. This will take discernment on your part.\nIf the time does come when you feel the need to change instructors, I\u2019d encourage you to do it in as clean, clear, and honest manner as possible. Although some people just stop taking lessons, not only can this strain your relationship with the instructor and the studio, but it steals the opportunity for the instructor or studio to respond to your issue, and even if the issue can\u2019t be amended, it robs them of the feedback you could provide so they don\u2019t recreate the same pitfall with another student.\nSo, to answer the primary question of this post, am I a free agent? Yes\u2026and no. Yes, because I take classes at a variety of places that I feel will enhance and enrich my dancing. But no, because I am very clear that Ivan is my primary ballroom instructor and I\u2019m not going anywhere else for that. I mean, the entire relationship is built on trust. You can\u2019t have trust if you are not engaging in open, honest communication or going behind someone\u2019s back. I guarantee it will show up in your dancing.\nWhat about you? Do you only dance with one instructor at one location? Why? How does that work for you? Or do you dance a lot of places? What positive or negative experiences can you share around that? What advice would you give someone who was considering dancing more than one place or changing instructors? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T01:58:08Z", "url": "https://dancingwithstefanie.com/tag/dance-studio/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The trial will be run by biotech company Bioquark, which is primarily focused on developing \"combinatorial biologics\" that get to the heart of disease reversal rather than just treating the symptoms. They believe that stem cells can be used as a kind of \"reset button\" for the body, erasing cell damage and stimulating tissue regeneration. They claim that their research could potentially lead to \"complex tissue and organ regeneration, disease reversion, and even biological age reversal.\"\n\"This represents the first trial of its kind and another step towards the eventual reversal of death in our lifetime,\" Dr Ira Pastor, the CEO of Bioquark, told The Telegraph. \"To undertake such a complex initiative, we are combining biologic regenerative medicine tools with other existing medical devices typically used for stimulation of the central nervous system, in patients with other severe disorders of consciousness.\nWe hope to see results within the first two to three months.\"\n\"It is a long term vision of ours that a full recovery in such patients is a possibility, although that is not the focus of this first study \u2013 but it is a bridge to that eventuality.\"\nSome scientists are already expressing doubt that this could lead to anything resembling a genuine recovery for braindead patients, as studies have shown that humans' capacity for regeneration is somewhat limited. However, even if the regeneration aspect of the project isn't quite successful, the study will still shed light on the process of brain death, and possibly spur innovation in the treatment of debilitating neurological diseases.\n\"Through our study, we will gain unique insights into the state of human brain death, which will have important connections to future therapeutic development for other severe disorders of consciousness, such as coma, and the vegetative and minimally conscious states, as well as a range of degenerative CNS conditions, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease,\" said Dr Sergei Paylian, Founder, President, and Chief Science Officer of Bioquark.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T15:04:40Z", "url": "https://www.outerplaces.com/science/item/12029-new-clinical-trial-will-attempt-to-bring-dead-humans-back-to-life", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Esther and Kenso fell in love with , and chose , the stunning Tuscany themed backdrop of Central Florida\u2019s Bella Collina Wedding Venue for their Central Florida April wedding and what a wedding it was! How can you possibly go wrong with a gorgeous bride, a handsome groom, and a beautiful venue?? This beautiful Haitian couple chose a classic contemporary and elegant theme for their Central Florida wedding. We have such a history with Esther\u2019s family ( We have already photographed 3 of her siblings weddings with 2 to go!) that Stan and I were really excited as well as nervous about capturing Esther and Kenso\u2019s Bella Collina Wedding just perfectly. Everything went smoothly with the talented team of Lynn Stuckas of Your Events by L & L who was in charge of coordinating Esther and Kenso\u2019s stunning Central Florida Bella Collina wedding. Esther\u2019s flowers were just beautifully done by Weddings by Carly Anes, and complimented her stunning mermaid dress from Demetrios Bridal. Her off white mermaid dress was heavily beaded, with lots of sparkle to compliment the dress, while the form fitting skirt enhanced and complimented Esther\u2019s perfect curves. The finishing touches were hair and makeup and beautifully done by LeJeune Artistry . The reception ballroom at Bella Collina was beautifully decorated with linens by Eli of Linen Creations, and D.J Geordany Jean Baptiste made sure that the music was a crowd pleaser, playing a well rounded selection of music from soca to hip hop to R & B. Of course we must include that Esther and Kenso\u2019s stunning Bella Collina Wedding was captured by S & S Photography and their beautiful video captured by Kelvin Aultman .\nBrandy and Dave met working aboard the Disney Fantasy Cruise ship in 2013. Brandy worked with the cruise staff team while Dave worked on the ship wide tech team. After nearly 4 years of sailing the seven seas with Mickey Mouse, the two lovebirds decided it was time to start a life together on land, in far away New Zealand. For Brandy\u2019s 28th birthday Dave surprised her with a fantastic trip to the Bay of Islands and Cape Reinga, the northern most point of New Zealand. It was here, overlooking the ocean, on the last day of their trip, that Dave got down on one knee and popped the question. Brandy of course said \u201cyes!\u201d and the excitement of planning their September 22 nd wedding began.\nWhen planning their wedding Brandy and Dave wanted a theme that reflected their life together thus far. They loved traveling, and decided to go with a vintage travel theme to match the grandeur feeling of the Ballroom at Church Street Station in downtown Orlando. Each table was themed around a different city in the world that they had visited together and of course they had to incorporate , at the head table no less, the Disney Fantasy Ship where they met. A \u201d Where in the world are you sitting? \u201d map directed guests to which city in the world they would be sitting and dining at. Party favors included a delicious candy station which included many different treats from the U.S , the U.K and New Zealand. A nice personal touch were the added photographs of each of their grandparents, on their wedding days ,which added the perfect vintage touch to their Ballroom at Church Street Wedding.\nSince Brandy and Dave are from two different countries the most important thing they wanted to make sure happened on their wedding day was getting their friends and families together, allowing everyone to get to know each other. Their guests came all the way to Orlando from Australia, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to celebrate with them, and celebrate they did with delicious food, lively dancing and drinking all night long until their fiery sparkler departure. Their Ballroom at Church Street Station Wedding was a huge success, that brought together 2 families, and 2 different cultures.\nAll wedding days are a blur but no one will forget the epic Maid of Honors \u201d rap speech \u201d nor the fun father/daughter mash up dance Brandy did with her dad. Dave\u2019s fondest memory was the tender and sweet dance with his grandmother to her favorite song. Congratulations Brandy and Dave, your wedding was great fun and S&S wishes you both many many years of happiness together!!\nI honestly can say that Madalyn was one of the most relaxed brides I\u2019ve ever encountered , lucky Aaron! When a bride \u201cgoes with the flow\u201d so to say the stress of the wedding is greatly reduced. If you have no theme other than choosing things you like how can you go wrong? Instead of having to find things that fall within your theme or \u201cgo with \u201d your theme you can simply find what works for you thus opening up all sorts of possibilities. Madalyn and Aaron chose Maison et Jardin for their beautiful April 1st Orlando wedding and it was refreshing and surprising to me how beautiful and elegant everything was for a bride who had no theme and no preconceived ideas about how her Central Florida wedding day should be.\nCongratulations to this wonderful and so in love couple, S & S Photography wishes you many years of health and happiness!!\nWe went with a personal friend to DJ our wedding. He knows our preferences in music and he was so eager to make us happy on our big day!\nWould you believe that Mike & Paige\u2019s parents and brother kept this proposed proposal secret for 3 WEEKS!! How her Mom kept that from her is beyond me, I would have burst from excitement! Paige and Mike eventually chose the beautiful Mission Inn Resort for their Orlando wedding. The day was rainy but nothing could dampen Paige and Mike\u2019s excitement! All the planning , all the details, all came together ( with considerable help from their talented planner Katie Jimenez, owner of Big Day Celebrations, Katie@BigDayCelebrations.com) and their Mission Inn Resort wedding was a true celebration of the joining of 2 lives and 2 families. Here we are 2 months later and these 2 wonderful people are now busy helping others. Paige is a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner and Mike works in Law Enforcement protecting and serving the citizens of Orlando.\nStan and I wish Paige and Mike a long, happy and healthy life together. These are 2 people that are thoughtful, kind, smart, gorgeous, and just plain NICE\u2026good people as they say, with wonderful families supporting them. Lots of love to them!!\nAdvice from the happy couple\u2026\u201d Always think about why your partner may be acting the way they are, whether they be happy, sad, mad,anxious etc. We find that this brings us peace and helps us to react in an appropriate way. We also encourage couples to \u201d not sweat the small stuff\u201d . Is it really worth your energy to bring up that annoying thing that happened last week ; the answer is usually no. When there are big issues, talk about them and again, think about why your partner is acting the way they are. If you know what may be causing them their sadness, anger, anxiousness only then can you move in a direction towards happiness! Great words of wisdom Mr & Mrs. Hamm!\nAlyssa and Bud\u2019s beautiful Venice wedding!\nBud and Alyssa first met at a Chilies restaurant in 2013 after initially meeting on line via \u201cChemistry.com\u201d. Clarence, AKA Bud, worked the night shift as an Orlando Police Officer and Alyssa, as she says,\u201dbeing surrounded by engineers limited our dating scene so we both turned to online dating and it all turned out for the best!\u201d Bud said that,\u201d they talked for hours, about everything from work to zip lining, and unbeknownst to them, began laying the foundation of what would become a wonderful and lasting relationship.\u201d Bud\u2019s proposal began with an invitation to dinner and a movie, after which they headed for their favorite local spot, Cranes Roost. \u201d It\u2019s where we first became officially boyfriend and girlfriend, and had our first kiss.\u201d Bud even had a photographer there who, under the false pretense of \u201cpracticing\u201d on them, proceeded to take their picture. Alyssa went along and agreed to \u201d have some stranger take our photo\u201d Bud, after the first photo, got down on his knee and proposed! She said YES and now here they are, happily married newlyweds in 2016.\nAugust 6 th was the big day and Bud and Alyssa agreed that they wanted an outdoor themed wedding, without the outdoors\u2026\u201d Too hot for a Florida August outdoor wedding\u201d said Alyssa. They chose the beautiful Plantation in Venice, a spot on the East coast close to where Alyssa grew up. One thing Alyssa knew for certain was that she wanted a cookie table at the reception. \u201d I was raised by my Mom and always grew up close to her, she was the one there through thick or thin. My Dad lived in NY so when I visited him he would make sure we had our time together by waking me up in the middle of the night and we would have Oreos and milk\u201d How super sweet..pun intended!\nEverything came together beautifully on their wedding day in large part due to Alyssa being a very hands on and involved bride. \u201cEverything was set up and made by myself or one of my amazing bridesmaids- from the homemade jams and the signs to the center pieces and the kids table!\u201d Apart from a tiny thunderstorm that blew through as the ceremony was about to start the wedding was a success\u2026lively & full of dancing and laughter, which ended with an exciting ecofetti departure. Alyssa and Bud Stan and I wish you two lovebirds a long, safe and prosperous life together and want to thank you for inviting S & S to be a part of such a momentous occasion in your lives!\nAfter 7 years of dating Chris unexpectedly proposed to Pam in June of 2015 at a Styx concert! \u201cWe had seen them twice before and were super excited to be able to go again. The show was incredible and we had a great hotel which we ended up at after the concert. Our room had a view overlooking a river and he suggested we take a walk along the boardwalk. I was a little curious since it was an odd time of night to go (around 11:30pm I think) but it was beautiful. We walked onto the bridge over the river and joked about how many spiders there were (I am afraid of them of course). He told me how much he loved me and promised he always would then asked if I would do the same and when I said yes he pulled out the ring. I promptly dropped the water bottle that I was holding onto his foot, I was so surprised! But we laughed and I practically screamed yes and the rest, as they say, is history.\u201d Pam\u2019s Mother had purchased a dress for her to wear at her prom many years ago at the Goodwill store in her high school home town of Lockhart , for $14.00. She ended up not being able to go to her Senior Prom and the dress stayed with her as she moved and relocated 3 times\u2026.she loved her dress too much to part with. No occasion seemed worthy of it, until Chris proposed\u2026\u201dAfter Christopher and I got engaged I had no doubt that I would wear my long lost dress, it was perfect. The theme, flowers and decor all fell into place after that! \u201d Stan and I loved Pam\u2019s entire look\u2026from her dress to her beautiful summer flowers in her hair, the inspiration coming from her childhood\u2026\u201dMy mother wore a flower crown for her wedding and I remembered how much I loved playing with it when I was younger. I thought about buying a crown online but the cost was way higher than I expected and the colors were good but not perfect. It took many trips to a handful of craft stores but I was able to find the flowers that I really wanted and after reading some DIY articles I decided to make my own crown. All in all it cost around $35 (for the stuff I actually used) and took about 18 total hours.\u201d The guest list for their intimate July 31st wedding was short..her parents, his parents , his sister and boyfriend and a favorite Aunt\u2026\u201dOur parents, my aunt, and Christopher\u2019s sister and her boyfriend have truly been our support system and very best of friends over the last 5 years which made them the most important people to have with us on our wedding day.\u201d The ceremony was in a beautiful park tucked away in a Longwood neighborhood, with dinner at Lake Mary\u2019s FishBones.Congratulations to a sweet, unique and beautiful couple!!\nKarla & Steven Bayes chose one of Orlando\u2019s premier wedding locations for their beautiful March wedding\u2026yes we are late posting this but better late than never! Orlando\u2019s ChampionsGate Resort is a gorgeous Central Florida location perfectly suited to hosting Central Florida weddings. This venue is beautifully decorated, especially the courtyard and ballrooms. The accommodations are luxurious , the cuisine exceptional and the service superb. S & S Photography enjoyed working with a talented , organized and detail oriented co-ordinator and her team, Xiomarra Sanchez, owner of A Nite To Remember Events. ( Niteevents.com) Xiomarra and her team ensured that every detail, every desire, every element and every aspect of the wedding day was meticulously addressed , handled and taken care of immediately,for the bride and groom. When I asked Xiomarra why Steven and Karla chose S & S Photography for their Central Florida wedding photography needs she answered\u2026\u201dS & S was a no brainer when picking a wedding photographer for Karla and Steven. Charlene and Stan were the photographers for Karla\u2019s Mothers wedding a few years back and they LOVED them! Working with S & S is EASY and a PLEASURE. I LOVE Charlene\u2019s energy. The pictures speak for themselves. EXCELLENT photography and an EXCELLENT company\u201d. We always look forward to working with A Nite To Remember Events and we look forward to the change in photography needs of Karla and Steven\u2026from being their wedding photographers to, one day, becoming their FAMILY photographers!\nIt was so wonderful to be the wedding photographers for a couple that truly compliments each other and are so in love with each other! Heather and Todd\u2019s Bella Collina wedding was absolutely wonderful and touching beyond words, just perfect. Their outdoor traditional wedding ceremony on the lawn at Bella Collina was romantic and emotional\u2026watching Todd try to stay composed while Heather walked towards him on her Dad\u2019s arm had me tearing up! After the ceremony we had so much fun taking their wedding pictures\u2026under the Bell Tower, down by the bridge\u2026we\u2019re always able to find great locations for wedding pictures at the Tuscan themed Bella Collina. The evening was filled with joy and laughter and everyone there had an amazing time celebrating the union of two amazing people!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T11:00:31Z", "url": "http://snsweddings.com/tag/orlando-wedding-photographer/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "I figured if I could do it at all, I needed the help of the big guns. My 400mm f/2.8 lens would have worked nicely, it would allow me to zoom into the moon to fill the frame and still let plenty of light in to give me the best chance of a capture. I ran into two problems. First off, doubled \u2013 the 400mm 2.8 lens goes to 800mm f/5.6. Then, the more zoomed in you are, the more the movement of the subject in the frame. I had settled on a 1.4x extender which would get me close to 600mm with just a one stop penalty to put me at f/4.\nNext was the camera. I have a Canon Rebel 35mm film SLR that I bought on eBay for $1. It had controller issues, but thankfully the camera just so happened to work set to manual. I gave the inside a coat of urethane, set up some glass guides to hold a plate and shot it. 600mm, f/4 \u2013 ten seconds. And that\u2019s the plate you see to the right.\nFast forward ten or so months I just so happen to be interested in seeing what I can achieve with the setup again. My converted SLR has since gone missing in the attic and I really didn\u2019t want to permanently convert one of my many other 35mm film SLR cameras to wet plate. So for a few minutes I looked at the back of the camera and came up with a game plan on a plate holder that turned a 35mm camera into a wet plate camera.. And the best thing was that it was reversible. That is, if you\u2019re careful to not drip corrosive silver nitrate into the body.\nBecause the material is just a millimeter and a half thick I decided to hollow the center with no corners and then just stick corners on myself with a good metal to plastic glue. The corners themselves are cut pieces of trophy plate.\nOnce the glue was dried the holder gives a nice snug fit in the film compartment of the Canon Rebel 35mm body! I hope to get to making some images soon with it!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T07:19:12Z", "url": "http://johnmilleker.com/weblog/blog/2013/08/24/plate-holder-prototype-35mm-slr", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Also, whenever I try to run a loco through either turnout, it derails!

Your take and please do not be shy to post something here.\nTrouble with the 1.0.2 download. I'm getting a file not found error. Possibly because the link says crp rather than cpr?\nHappy New Year to all of you!!!!!!!!\nI confirm that the download of version 1.0.2 and the installation in Trainz went as expected, ie. no problems at all.\nThanks for such good service and for such a superb route.\nThanks Gilles most other Roy's trainzers confirmed also good execution of the new release and yes works as expected, thanks for the ice comment.\nHi everyone! I want to thank Roy for an AMAZING route (I bought the 3-in-1 CPR Mountain Sub)!! The detail is ridiculous and I cannot even imagine the effort and time it took to create this route. Today I spent some time reading the new PDF instructions for the CMTM System (http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showt...7-CMTM-Upgrade) and was wondering if anyone else other than myself is crazy enough to attempt creating at least one session utilizing it. It seems like a daunting endeavor and I have no doubt that it would be an intense effort. However, I believe that a few of us dedicated enough may be able to team up and put something quite impressive together for this equally impressive route. Anyone have any thoughts or ideas? I especially would like Roy to chime in here too. Thanks!\nEnough industries to do the first steps with lumber industries rolling stock and truck bringing the lumber from the forest..eg.\n64WarHorse, yes, I think that there are enough industries, esp if you include the whole Mountain Sub. Not to even mention what Roy here has proposed (integrating it into his upcoming additional route(s)). CMTM does support all sorts of cool scenarios as mentioned by Roy, not just yard/switching duties specifically. I am in the process of learning the new CMTM version (v.4) and would gladly contribute as much time/effort that I can to developing some sessions if we do it in a team fashion. :) Maybe we can start small at first and make some very basic sessions/scenarios to see how it goes. If all works out well then we can collaborate and come up with some truly epic sessions for these awesome routes! This idea is very exciting for me and if some of you share my enthusiasm (esp Roy), I really think we could build something legendary here. Idk. Maybe we can pull DAP (CMTM creator) into this somehow too.\nOkay, colour me intrigued. So where do we start? I suppose the first question would be, do we need to modify any rolling stock for CMTM?\nThis is the most expensive ad-on I have ever bought, but I consider it worth every penny.\nKeep the spirit high. :) I really look forward to following the devlopment of Your project.\nSteve i agree i will tell Ray to change the background in a neutral easy to read color monday! promise!\nChrisD yeeeehhh wow that feels good you like it as so many did already before you and yes it is a marvel and yes worth every penny you spent There is so much to discover it will take you a lot of time to find out and still not see it all,........that means yes i spent a lot of time creating this and hope to finish the next section soon.\nRailworks user here that just had to see what Trainz was capable of in its most extreme! Picked up Trainz on 75% discount and bought the Rogers Pass route from your site. The level of detail in this route is amazing. Im a routebuilder in Railworks, and I know how long it takes to build anything. I cant imagine it being any different in Trainz.. Your work is really and I mean really fantastic! Its all in the details as they say and your route has it all. Take care all and thanks again for your hard work Roy!\nHello all! Sorry for the few days absence but I've been quite busy lately. Anyway, I am almost done reading and re-reading the CMTM documentation and would soon like to start collaborating with those of you interested in helping me out with some basic CMTM session ideas and subsequently creation. All of those interested should PM me on the main Trainz forums thread and send me their e-mail addresses so we can communicate more efficiently. Or, feel free to e-mail me directly at runthat1@gmail.com.\nsaw that one too1 I did straighten a track segment and did not realize the signposts were separate and so got this cosmetic error. Moved the post and fixed already, thanks for reporting.\nThank you for this nice route it is wel very long to drive cpr mountain sub -)) my wife is killing me.\nGuillaume, i cannot advice you what is a less of more painful death, killed by your wife or trainz excitement, lol.\nThanks 4 sharing, Ning laughs she understand.\nHopefully this will work in TS12, seeing errors as I install, previous versions errors, warnings. All help is greatly appreciated. Thanks for the routes!\nall related to JVC grass items by author jankvis.\nmissing deps or unknown deps 99% of the time are caused by to many cdp's installed at the same time in Content Manager Program! So if jankvis has unknown ora ny other look for the author and reinstall that group like here for Jankvis go to group 3 dependencies you downloaded and reinstall the group J in there, should work flawless honest.\nhmm working in my dungeon on Mount Stephens/Spirals/Lake Louise area Laggan sub.....sssst top secret.\n\"Roy, the screenshots of the Mountain Subdivision are phenomenal. Have you done the whole thing to absolute scale? What sources did you use (or are you a railroader)? What version of Trainz will this run on and are there related kuids included?\"\nLike Google real scale and detail as far as possible.\nRunning TS12 latest version 49922.\nThanks a million Roy! You are a wonderful and patient support. Everything is up and going, beautifully! Now for that latte, sit back, relax and enjoy.\nThursday Feb 27th I will upload release 1.03 of the CPR Mountain Sub. Claim yours by sending an email to me and i will link an upload for you. Have a great week!\ndid you have any succes implementing the CMTM system for our routes? let us know what the current status is ok?\nHello! Sorry for the lack of updates, but I was out-of-state enjoying Mardi Gras in New Orleans for a few weeks. :) But yes, CMTM DOES work with the routes and it works quite well actually. I had started to collaborate with another member here but he hasn't replied to my last e-mail. He had some VERY good session ideas which I was excited to work on with him. He had suggested doing multiple CMTM sessions, each one building upon the previous one(s). I will attempt to contact him again. Otherwise, I, myself, have begun testing CMTM implementation on the CPR Mountain Sub route (3-in-1) and am now trying to come up with some of my own session ideas. If ANYONE else here would like to help, PLEASE contact me via e-mail or PM on the forums.\nMardi Gras that has been a while for me.... very nice time!\nWell CMTM that sounds good, let me know when you have something for me to test here and give ideas to you as feedback. If lucky not to long we have a connection to the Laggan sub to run real CMTM!\nKeep up the excellent work and keep me in the pict.\nCPR Mountain Sub release 1.0.3 is ready for dl.\nemail me and I open in your account for dl!\nHello all! I must apologize for the delay in providing any updates regarding implementing CMTM 4 on the CPR Mountain Sub. I am just starting to get over a nasty bout with bronchitis/upper respiratory infection and have not been able to devote much time to Trainz or much else aside from sleep (and coughing my lungs out). Steve (I am now unsure of his Trainz username here) contacted me awhile ago about his interest and desire to help me get some CMTM sessions thought-out and started. I will be contacting him later today to continue to work out the details of some of his ideas (which are really awesome btw!!). Not going to ruin the surprise or anticipation, but due to the route's huge size and unique layout of industries, yards, and portals to subsequent routes that Roy has mentioned, the sessions Steve has suggested as some possibilities really do a great job of taking those factors into account.\nRoy, yes!, CMTM 4 can and DOES work with the route(s) and YES!, it should definitely be something you take into consideration for future updates, upgrades, and new routes/expansions. Steve and I both came to the same conclusion that adding CMTM to existing rolling stock is a very simple matter of just adding some lines to the config.txt files. However this poses a potential problem with the original content creators' licensing/hosting mandates. I am not sure what to do about this potential issue, but I am sure we will find a way.\nkep up the good work guys, i work hard to get the daunting task of texturing over and over again certain areas to my liking but as i get older (like all of you) every day, day by day I get more picky and say to myself time is not of the essence, quality, pride of work and fun of doing it makes the difference.\nif this continues I close the blog and concentrate only on supporting you guys my unbelievable nice cosy and great roys trainz family. SP1 is the door closer for me with trainz although I will support you guys to the end of the 5 major routes for the next years to come and look seriously for another alternative than N3V.\ni not understand what fun they have spamming this blog. there is no financial gain nor fight or dispute of any kind related unless they show their face like we do.\nugly but it seems to make them happen.\nGarbage not only fills our oceans and kills habitat.\nI just finished testing a way around the grotesque bug existing for years far as TRS 2009 and now even blocking my routes from working with tunnels.\nIt is not a copmplete guarantee it should work now for you to so pls dl it and test it once I uploaded only CPR marked as 57720_CPR. i not upgrade any smaller route instead I will teach you how to spli them yourselves from a certain release for your own enjoyment. Kepp all routes updated is to much work right now and easier to split the biog one local at your desk.\nYess, they failed to block me here is a version that will work at least it does on my computer 57720! I will now start prep upload for the route with tunnels working but its new tunnels not the old one i did change little things in the config too of the tunnels.\nOk just uploade the latest CPR version working with big tunnels in 57720 SP1 and also uploade the 577203rdparty_fix for deps new tunnels you need to dl again. sorry for the incovenience but thank N3V for all the mishap and fuzz they create and deny.\nI am not sure how to update my Rogers Pass to SP1. Please advise.\nNiels send me an email and acc namr and see what we can do ok?\nMaybe You should take a look at Open Rails when You get a few moments to spare.\nThis is where I have moved after giving up on TS12 and its \"Service Pack\".\nThis freeware Train Simulator (at 0.8 rev 1561) uses at present existing MSTS Routes, but is running on 4 cores and is revised several times each week.\nBug reporting and fixing is a breeze compared to N3V, and the team even works for nothing.\nVisual range from the CAB, where I am supposed to be when I drive a train, is 4 Km\u00b4s and can be set even higher If You want to, but 4 Km\u00b4s is GREAT sustaining a 100+ frame rate.\nThe driving experience is CLASSES Higher than Trainz.\nSorry for rubbing salt in Your wound, but my wound is just as great thanks to N3V, and You said in a previous post that You might change platform.\nJust wanted to let you know that after a fresh install of TS12 SP1 and CPR Mountain Sub 57720 I am simply amazed.\nNever before have I been able to run with 5000MT draw successfully. Usually I cannot even open up the CPR as it locks up my computer. I have never been able to run it with all sliders maxed out but with TS12 SP1 and CPR 57720 I have no problems.\nThe graphics are a huge improvement as is the sound.\nIn fact the only minor issue I have is a slight stutter when the scenery detail slider is on normal or high with the other sliders at max value. Smooth as silk if scenery detail is on low. this is unheard of on my humble computer. I will play with the slider settings a little more as I am sure there is a better compromise re the stutter.\nI have kept the TS12 pre SP1 install just in case, but I am really loving the 57720 version so much.\nI will report back after testing in a heavy yard area and with other trains about.\nThat's all for now, Andrew.\nsorry to hear you leave.\nWell if Open rails has a modeller similar to trainz or better, if the dbase of 3rd party freeware objects to choose from is similar or better, if there is a way to \"move\" \"recreate the same DEM, networks, road,splines and locations of existing objects ....what else.\nI know the problem, and there is no easy solution.\nAs for the assets, there may be a way forward. Most assets are built with some kind of 3D modeller, and if the raw files (before export to Trainz) is at hand they can be exported to MSTS as well.\nI am sure we will never get to a quater of a million assets, but right now N3V is voiding a batch of these, so..\nI not need all dls items so far 400 are faulty in my trainz dbase. ouch but can live with it for the moment.\nthanks for your support dear friend say hello home from all of us!!\nNew version of CPR Mountain Sub TS14 release 1.0.5 now available.\njust uploaded the 1.0.5 release which runs very nice and is the best ever driver version so far in 10 years! Scenery and quality is beyond expectations and a complete surprise probably for N3V too they never check or report things anyway.\nOGL is now finally the way to go and has better fps too when tweaking your Nvidia.\nPersonally I am most happy with driver as the speedtrees and my textures now do VERY well!!!\nI just made a free roam around Your route and the memory usage peaked at 2,454,000 Kb, so Trainz definately uses more than the usual 2 Gb. And, no locking or long thinking pauses.\nRoy, thanks again, I have donwloaded all 1.0.5, do I need all these if I have the previous version?\nIf you dl already earlier revs deps you not need to dl again same.\nChris thanks for the link it seems to work better than expected!\nIs there a way to undo the 4GB patch? My trainz.exe file is changed, cannot apply patch #2. Thanks.\nyou run into the same booby trap too like me.\nCurrently i make some backups of older TS212 versions to an old HDD but a slow one. After done I will than carefully upgrdae another 57720 on my SSD and install same way you do.\nI lost my major HDD backup disk incl my original TS12 files from trainz setup. Not in the mood now to see if i can dl them again from trainz... Maybe when we finished supplying N#V with all the bugs they will fix them for the next TS14 for sure and use us as their testers like always.\nthere is and never will be a rollback from them so when goes wrong you have to uninstall reinstall crazy but true as far as I know.\nkeep me us posted and you can post in roy doors thread so other can learn from it.\nThat is Your original file. Just delete the Trainz.exe and rename tha backup.\nOk guys this evening uploaded tons of kuids upgraded to trainz build 3.5 to be used in TS12 49922 and 87898.\nIf your interested dl the 5 groups on the deps page of your profile.\nRoy, just found your website by chance, looked at your route pics. they are the best I've seen. You are an artist.\nFor all those using the CPR Mountain freeware route with s301 ZR grasses which unfortunately not do the job at all. I did replace them today but the route is not updated yet.\nHere is a way to use replace assets and you can dl via your profile the Pofig-JVC frewware cdp with the grasses needed.\nI did work on a proper replacement for the S301 grasses for the freeware grass version of the CPR route.\nI thought that those from jvc in the pofig lib could do the job till one decides to change/upgrade to ST_2 grasses if he/she likes them more.\nfind near track following item \"ZR~(Gr-1)Grass R-Dark green-2 mtr\"\nopen in surveyor main menu replace assets and place this object in left side as assets to replace!\nclick current selection only to make it replace all in the route!\n\"3D1_Pg-JVC_gr1_22\" is asset to replace with!\n3D1_Pg-JVC_gr2_58 asset to replace with!\nIn case you are not familiar with I can make tomorrow a short video how to but bet you know this command how to use.\nRoy, a query please. I am in the process of writing a Session for CPR to be uploaded (hopefully) to the DLS.\nI have the freeware S301 grasses at the moment. If I replace them with the 3D1 grasses does your map still retain your kuid?\nIf I upload a Session with S301 grasses will other players with other versions of grasses still be able to download and play a Session from the DLS?\nI not have experience with creating sessions to that level of detail how trainz would handle it bit from the surveyor handling this it should work as long as the other side has the same grass it will show that grass.\nMost probably the session would have missing deps (grasses) if the other party not have those grasses in his/her dbase.\nWe have to test this and see or discuss with other more experienced session users on the forum.\nThe eeasiest and most forward way for you however would be to make these grasses Gr... now used mandatory to dl and install when someone dl your session.\nI have never used Replace Assets before so I'm not sure if it also replaces your kuid with mine for the map. That would be no good to upload a Session to the DLS.\nI'll play safe for the moment and keep to the S301 grasses until my Session is released. After that I can experiment.\nI think you are right in that another player would have missing deps but that should'nt affect the playability of the Session.\nBTW, what is the correct spelling. Illecillweat or Illecillwaet? Both are used in the map. I would like to know the correct one for use in html messages.\nBefore you release any session on the dls make sure that not inadvertedly parts of the payware route are linked or available thru the session on the dls.\nI never used sessions in depth but I think i saw once a large route file linked in the sessions data file that was the major part of the route.\nThis we have to avoid you understand.\nReplace asset is easy and handy so pls use it and let me now the new grasses do the job.\nIllecillewaet is the correct name.\nI understand your concerns about people getting hold of your route through other means. That will not happen with me. I shall be uploading 2 files to the DLS when ready. One is the Session and the other is a HTML file which will contain the instructions, messages, etc.\nNothing of your route is included apart from your kuid in the Session config.txt that gives the map being used. What this means is that if someone hasn't bought the route and downloads the Session, they won't be able to play it as the route will be a 'Missing Dependency'.\nWith your permission I'll add into the DLS description that the Session uses a Payware route only available from you at Roy's Trainz. You never know, it might bring in a few extra sales! If someone has already bought the route then everything is peachy.\nI've started the Session at Revelstoke CPR Yard and have now reached Illecillewaet (correct spelling thanks).\nI'll tidy up here and save a backup to external HD before I try replacing the grasses.\nthanks for the nice post and agree with you.\nSorry for the late approval of the post.\nMy webmaster adviced me to go this cumbersome way to approve outside posts since hackers/spammers keep bombarding the website relentlessly what fun they think they have is unclear to me but this world has more unclear habits and things happening.\nThanks for the reply. I agree with you, these hackers are a menace.\nI installed the grasses ok but what I feared would happen, did. I could only save them in a new map with my kuid. This of course is no good as I need to upload a Session for use with your map, your kuid.\nWhat I think I'll do is to continue on to Wakely and stop there. I'll upload the Session and explain that it can only be played with your S301 map. I'll wait and see if there is any positive interest/feedback before deciding whether to carry on to Golden.\nDon't bother replying to this post. I'll put future posts on the Forum and let N3V worry about the hackers.\nIf you go into the config of your session and change the route map the session refers to than, anyone who has the CPR in any form but different grasses eg should be able to run the route/session.\nWhen you have a test for me i can proof what I say when you ready.\nI have done this dozen times when a session linked to an older CPR version I wanted to link to a newer, changed the config map kuid the session has to run on and done.\nI understand what you mean when updating Sessions but this is your own kuid on your own computer and Trainz recognises this.\nWhen I replaced the grasses I can only save it in my kuid which Trainz gives me, like it or not.\nFor instance: your map 122860:100035, after installing and saving the new grasses has now become 90608:100027, the 90608 being my kuid.\nThis is fine as long as I don't want to upload the map to anywhere. It may now be in my kuid but doesn't belong to me.\nI think the way to go is to release the Session with the default map 122860:100035. I will add an instruction on how to change the map kuid in the Session to whatever they have on their system. This will not infringe your copyright as any player must have bought your original map before they can update grasses.\nAll very complicated so I'll leave that for now until I get the Session finished.\nI'll come back to you at that time to see about testing.\ndefying 58414 little critters and bugs the Rogers Pass passed my QA tests with \"flying colors\" after crashing first time after 2 hours without any normal reason than the exisitng Trainz bug.\nThe route is now ready for dl for those interested in a 58414 1.07 version of this section.\nAbout wich trainz TS12 versions support my routes. Simple and straight forward ALL releases work 100% and dependencies of the route are all working and links for dl provided. It cannot be more simple and all in one place.If for any reason you feel well with the 49922 version dl this one from your account profile.I use the 58414 as the driver here runs particularly well, but earlier versions no problem.\nCan i ask what the file size is for the whole Route please Roy ?, Like to download the whole thing mate i am on a limited wireless service here and it would take for ever to download if the Route and Deps is too big. And does it only come in a winter version ?. Loks pretty cool the whole thing.\nsorry I just now checked the blog to see for comments that need approval. Many times hackers and sorts of try to ruin one's day and for unknown reason and sick pleasure that never works at least not with us.\nOk the size of the entire route is a cdp/zip 199 MB! not that big even for a limited internet connection and my site has fast acces so dl would work fine.\nThe deps are all grouped in smaller ones and also setup to fit as you said ltd acces internet connections.\nI am very pleased to see you around here and we would be more than happy to welcome you to our community. You will love it and yes the winter/seasonal groundtextures for a auto pre and post winter experience is included.\nCheck my thread there are somewhere also winterpictures around.\nThis should get you on the tracks with Roy's trainz.\nThanks Roy i'll certainly grab it at sum stage mate, Few other projects i want to take care of first though so thanks again.\nHate to be a pain again mate sorry but can i ask one more question, If i have not updated to the latest patchs for TS12 can i still use your Route ?. Or would i have to patch to the latest build ?. Thanks Roy.\nyes when you purchase my routes it will show you what to dowload for eg. 49922 WIN and MAC version and in case the 58414 release the coresponding CPR route working/updated for the version of TS12.\nAlso I did \"update a lot of built-in and other used cdp's to actualize them as far as feasible to run well on 58414.\nthese routes look awesome, i'm currently downloading alot of stuff for other software and will buy CPR Mountain Subdivision in a couple of hours. I hope the download includes everything needed to run the route because i'm new to Trainz12. Thank You Roy for your work of Art :) Harry from Montreal, Canada.\nyou make my birthday a complete success. thanks for the very nice comment.\nWelcome to Roys Trainz and YES there is one page containing ALL needed deps at your fingertips.\nOMG, WOW! Roy you're awesome! I just finished installing \"Rogers Pass\" and I am in shock at how beautiful the route looks in TS12. Your payware even looks better than Railworks TS2014......BRAVO!\nDo you remember if I have all the routes when I bought the $70 combo? If not, which one do I not have? Curious, thank you for all your hard work and beautiful creative things.\nThe 3 in combo means that you bought the CPR Mountain Sub from Ottertail all the way to west of Revelstoke.\nI made for a limited time 3 separate \"smaller\" routes cutting/overlapping with the huge CPR MOUNTAIN connecting them via Iportals.\nThe \"smaller 3 sep routes\" where temporarily I want to allow people to taste at \"entry\" level before deciding to go for the big one.\nSome users liked the smaller ones to run a few hours i.o. of 9 up all day.\n99% bought and uses the CPR MOUNTAIN SUB.\nI did not anticipate so much work due to several bugs in any trainz version when cutting. Imagine eg deleting a baseboard does not mean all data within and crossing is deleted and you and up with \"invisble floating elements\" ouside your cut route.\nthis morning Richard post on my trainz forum threads very touching post indeed!\n\"Hi Roy and everyone else who views this thread.\n5 days ago I had been in Trainz exile for around 4 years. If I am totally honest I didn't think I would ever take an interest in Trainz again having drifted onto other things. On Sunday afternoon I stumbled across The Kickstarter Project \"Trainz Simulator - A New Era\". Initially I made a modest pledge, I liked the idea and the more I read about it, the more my interest in the future of Trainz was growing. The fire was lit and within a few hours I was back on the Kickstarter page increasing my pledge. At this point I was going to take a back seat and strap myself in for the ride and watch the next 4 weeks unfold. It didn't stop there though, I still couldn't stop at pledge number 2. I decided I needed a bigger slice of the action and pledge number 3 was made within 24 hours of me starting all this. Having got this far and making a commitment to the future of Trainz it was time to dust down my last version of the game Trainz 2009 and take a look. I had remembered fondly how much I enjoyed Trainz 2004 and Trainz 2006 along with Trainz classics, although if I am honest winding the clock back 4 years and looking at Trainz 2009 did little to enhance my new found enthusiasm for the Trainz Kickstarter project.\nTaking the above into consideration it was time to research the current version of trainz and try and establish what the best available routes for Trainz 12 were. This is where I stumbled across Roys Trainz and after browsing his site and the forums I knew instantly I wasn't going to wait for my Get Trainz Now selection from the Kickstarter Pledge. I bought Trainz 12 along with CPR-Mountain-Sub TS14 and It's one of the best decisions I have ever made.\nThe Route is absolutely stunning Roy and is a credit to you.\nI look forward to seeing your work hit new heights in future versions of trains.\nain't that something wow feels good and gives lots of energy.\nThe day after Dec.17th we all feel much better KS first step reached and more streched goals will make it for sure.\nThanks all the trainzers who supported vie my website and of course all those that pledged on the official KS and trainz website!!!\nFor those new to my website asking how come this blog is not very active, the reason is simple we use the main Trainz forum my trheads and thus reach at the same time other trainzers not part (yet) of the Roy's Trainz family.\nIf you like to share on my threads that you pledged also thru my routes please post over there and here of course.\nI respect eachothers privacy and not publish a list.\nHappy Holidays and Happy New Trainz year and 2014!\nwilliam asked me today in an email if my routes work on TS 12 he bought from steam.\nYes all my routes work on TS12 and all versions, see on this website when you click more on the CPR Mountain Sub it show TS12 version number and windows and or MAC version number.\nWell, finally we did it the Laggan sub section West is ready to download.\nfurther posts and comments we do as usual on the trainz forum in my threads Canadian rocky Mountains 2011 and others i opened there.\n\"I just downloaded the Columbia River Basin and it is the most amazing, most detailed route in trainz! It took me in a CP ES44AC running at track speed almost 3 hours to get done! of course I met 2 trains along the way and had to follow a northbound CN grain, but it was amazing! Super fun, super realistic, and totally worth the $25! Every person that has trainz 12 download this now!!!!\"\nMid summer for most on this globe activity still high on roystrainz!! Most users know this blog is kind of sleepy as most activity blog etc is on trainz forum so please follow up over there to avoid double traffic.\nAt this moment i try to solve a mysterious bug on a beautiful very intelligent way of session automated traffic for CPR Mountain Sub created by my good dutch fellow friend Henk. His sessions works flawless on his computers but mine seem to love to bug a few AI trains so this and next week i will try to re-create his work from scratch and will keep you guys updated on the results. In case you are interested in the results email me or post on my threads on trainz forum.\nWell we did it and cleared all winter tracks into Ottertail and further to Viktor Lake. Now ready for download is the all NEW CPR MOUNTAIN SUB SEASONAL with 4 seasons and much more and yes for future TANE use ready to migrate to that level when they are ready. In the mean time you can enjoy this gem the fullest in TS12 and maybe appreciate more now that TS12 with the so many shortcomings still is a nice piece of sim. It is sad to say how people ravage over TANE CE a not finished product (never should be released) as most trainzer have no clue what it takes to get a finished product until the final day of official release.\nSo i released yesterday some 300 plus seasonal assets. you will find them on the download page when you have bought the CPR Mountain Sub 1.0.9 look for the route 1.0.9 seasonal.\nStill some more to do but that is for later now finish the TANE speedtrees first release for my routes.\nWell at least the curtain starts moving in the TANE 3D theatre announcing wazz up and coming \"soon\". Yes they start with the Columbia River Basin followed by all the other one's all new routes so much bigger,wider,more details than ever before and much much more to come all in super realistic mode and not to forget protypical!!\nOnce all routes in TANe are out there the TS12 routes will fade out slowly and close an era we all enjoyed so much. You can post here but I prefer you do on my Canadian Rocky Mountains thread in the trainz frorum. A little bit more patience to iron out little critters and cracks by the N3V crew. they have a mountain of routes from me to get ready so give them credit and energy to get things done the soonest and well.\nGlad Roy is still up and kickin'!!!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T10:45:15Z", "url": "http://www.roystrainz.com/blog/post/so-here-we-are-ready-start-blog-division-roys-trainz/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "A mattress for side sleepers? What about a mattress for back or stomach sleepers? Why is there a mattress designed specifically for side sleepers? The mattress must meet the unique needs that a side sleeper needs. The mattress should have a good temperature control so the person can sleep comfortably. The mattress should be reasonably priced and specifically designed for people who like to habitually sleep on their sides. The mattress must give this type of sleeper strong support for their backs, necks and legs, and feet. If the person likes to bend their legs while they sleep or they like to sleep with their legs straight the mattress must be able to meet these needs. This is why memory foam would be good to have so it will form to the person\u2019s peculiar sleeping position.\nBenefits and Uses: The mattress is supposed to have 3.5 gel memory foam that conforms to your body. It Will keep the spine aligned and prevent tossing and turning during the night. It does not allow for motion transfer and it will help you have a great night\u2019s sleep. It is lined with New Zealand wool which absorbs moisture and controls the temperature. It will also stop odor from absorbing into the mattress. It contains no harsh chemicals or chemicals that are flame retardant. The mattress is great for side sleepers and the company offers a limited 25 year limited warranty. The mattress is rolled up and compressed into the box for easy shipping.\nFeedback: The mattress had over 2200 review written about it. The customer has rheumatoid arthritis and says she can sleep on the sorest parts of her body and she has no pain. The pressure points are fine and she woke up at 7:30 in the morning and she felt like she had slept until 11:00 a.m. She was afraid to sleep on memory foam but she now has no reservations about it.\nThe customer said they researched the product thoroughly and decided to buy this memory foam mattress. He had tried several other memory foam mattresses in the past. He ordered the product and it was delivered to the front door. The customer was told the box weighed 102 lbs. and the customer was impressed with how compact the mattress was in the box. He dragged the box to the bed the mattress was to go on. He took it out of the box and he let the mattress air out for s night. He slept in another room and the next night he slept on the new mattress. He slept fine until 3:00 am and then he woke up with the sweats. He slept off and on until the morning. He slept on the mattress the next night but he put a fan near the mattress to cool it down. The fan got the room to cool so he had to set the fan at a higher speed. He developed an acute tailbone lower backache. He could not afford this injury because he does heavy lifting at his work. He decided to return the product so he contacted Amazon. The rep said since the mattress had human contact that Amazon could not return the product. The rep said his credit card would be fully reimbursed. He could not believe Amazon would give the money back without taking the mattress back. Amazon told him to give the mattress away. The customer rated the product 2-stars. You cannot blame him for giving the product such a low-rating.\nThe customer says this is the best mattress he has ever had except for a very expensive one his ex got to keep. This mattress did not sink in the middle or lose his form. He has had very good nights of sleep on the mattress and he gave it a 5-star rating. He highly recommends the product. This is a great mattress for the price. the customer says they have the mattress for a month and so far so good. The mattress is firm and the client likes to sleep on firm mattresses.\nThe customer is disabled and cannot go to the store to try out a mattress to see what it is really like before he would buy it. He tried this mattress and was disgusted with it because it was not firm at all. He showed a picture of himself sitting on the mattress. It sagged a good 6 to 8 inches when the mattress was 13 inches high. It is definitely not a firm mattress. The customer is tired of reading reviews that do not meet his expectations concerning the product. He thinks maybe the reviews are fake because they seem to be wrong most of the time. Being a disabled person he really needs the reviews to accurately reflect the quality of the product. He called Amazon and they said to give the mattress away but we will still fully refund your money. He likes the way Amazon takes care of the customers. The customer rated the product one-star.\nThe couple bought the mattress 3 years ago and they are disgusted with the product. They slept well on it at first but now they wake up in the morning with aches and pains. The mattress sagged in certain spots making it tougher to sleep. The rotated the mattress to try and alleviate the sags it did not work. They could not flip the mattress over because the thickness on the bottom is different than on the top. The customer said this mattress is only 3-years-old and is a lousy product. The customers rated the product 2-stars. The mattress was a solid mattress and it was easy to set up. The wife and husband were people of average weight so they cannot understand why the mattress would sag. They will not buy the product again and they do not recommend the product.\nBenefits and Uses: It is a knitted polyester and tencel blended fabric which will relieve tension on your shoulders and hips. The mattress is great for side sleepers and is so soft you will think you\u2019re sleeping in the clouds. The mattresses 4 layers will have you sleeping in optimal comfort. The top panel supplies you with comfort. The memory gel section alleviates pressure and gives you support while you sleep. The internal breathable layer keeps you cool while you sleep. The foundational layer comes in soft, medium, and firm designations. You order what you want. The mattress comes with a 10-year non-prorated warranty and a 120 night comfort guarantee.\nFeedback: The customer said the mattress came in 18 inches and 41 inches square. It came in a heavy plastic shipping bag and it was easy to roll out of the bag. The customer put it on the mattress box and they waited two hours to sleep on the mattress. Contrary to what they had read and heard the mattress had no odor. The customer said they slept well on the mattress and that it was a foam mattress and not a memory mattress. The customer is right it is not a memory mattress but a foam mattress. The customer does not want a memory mattress. The customer rated the product 5-stars.\nThe customer rated the product 5-stars and said it was very easy to set up. The product is very comfortable and this is all the customer writes. This is not a detailed review and tells us nothing about the quality of the product. Why is it great? Is it firm? Is it soft? The customer does not say why they rated the product 5-stars. The customer does not write if they slept soundly during the night or that they woke up refreshed in the morning. We do not know if the customer woke up in pain or if any previous pains were alleviated. This review has no selling value for future customers. The review is too general and neutral to convince anyone to buy or not to buy the product.\nThis is not a very positive review because the customer rated the product 3-stars. Which really is an average rating. The customer bought a medium and firm mattress. The couple decided to sleep on the firm mattress and put the medium mattress in the guest room. The wife has had back issues for years and needed the firm support. The husband weighs 200 lbs and needs to find a comfortable position to sleep in. The firm mattress met this requirement. Despite this seemingly positive review, the customer rated the product 3-stars which sends strong mixed signals. The review will not convince people to buy the product.\nThe customer says the mattress is like sleeping on a cloud as they said in their own words. They tried the mattress in the store and the longer they laid on it the better they liked it. They selected the firm mattress and they have rated the product 5-stars. They wrote the review the day this article was written 7/16/2018. So, it remains to be seen what the customer thinks about the product down the road.\nThe customer pays the mattress was easy to set up and is comfortable to sleep on but they did not say why it was easy to set up or why it was so comfortable for them to lay on. The customer rated the product 5-stars. Two women wrestled the box mattress upstairs without any extra help. They said once you get it out the box take it right to where it will be slept on. This is because the mattress once it comes out of the box it expands rapidly so you do not have a lot of time to move the mattress. They put it in the guest room but quickly moved it to the master bedroom because it was too good to leave in the guest room. The mattress is nice and the customer rated the product 5-stars.\nBenefits and Uses: Hopefully the mattress is worthy of the robust price tag it carries-$3599 which is very expensive. The mattress is 11.8 inches thick and it is made of temperature material. Or it will control the temperature as you sleep giving you a comfortable sleep. It helps to spread the body weight evenly across the bed helping you to sleep without waking up sore in the morning. The cover is made of breathable, cooling material that keeps the surface of the mattress cool. The mattress material is designed with cooling benefits and it draws heat from the body.\nFeedback: The customer says the mattress is working very well for them. They use to lay down and could not sleep and on top of it they would wake up sore. Now, with this mattress as soon as they lay down they fall asleep. They wake up in the morning without feeling sore. They would wake up every morning sore when they slept on the other mattress. The client rated it 5-stars. The customer says they wanted to wait before they wrote this review and the finally got around to writing the review. They wanted to sleep on the bed for awhile before making a report and they wrote their report. The customer said they always thought they would sleep on a coil mattress but they bought this one instead.\nBenefits and Uses: The mattress is designed to controls the temperature while you sleep and the memory gel contours to the body for a top night of sleep. 2 inches of memory foam sit on 8 inches of density foam with a soft foam cover. Like so many other mattresses the gel foam draws heat away from the body.\nFeedback: The customer at first did not like the mattress because it gave her a \u201csinking\u201d feeling. She sank in the mattress and it felt mushy. She called the rep and the rep said they would send a firmer mattress. But after 3 days the mattress became firmer and the customer fell in love with the mattress and canceled the order for a firmer mattress. The customer kept the medium mattress and she is sleeping very comfortably. Her husband loves the mattress as well and the customer is not waking up hot and sweaty during the night. The customer has rated the mattress 5-stars.\nThe customer has been using the mattress for quite awhile and it is just as supportive as it was on day one. The twin mattresses are working wonderfully for the customer and the bed doubles as a daybed and a night bed. The customer flips the mattress around but due to construction, the mattress cannot be flipped over. The customer weighs 140 pounds so keep this in mind as you read the review. If you are heavier than this customer\u2019s 140 lbs the bed may not work for you. The Customer says the mattress is as good as some mattresses that may cost a lot more than this one. The customer would buy the mattress again. The customer expects the mattress to last for years. The customer rated the product 5-stars.\nThe customer bought this mattress to replace a $1200 dollar mattress the client owned before. This mattress is as good as that $1200.00 dollar mattress. The mattress was easy to set up and the customer is the mattress is working very well. The customer sleeps peacefully every night on the mattress. The customer says it is worth 5-stars and will update in the future if any problems arise. The customer said the odor from the mattress dissipated quickly and the customer was glad about this.\nBenefits and Uses: The mattress has 2.5 inches of gel material on the top with 8.5 inches of deluxe base material. Supposedly the mattress brings a top luxury hotel feel to the home according to the company. The company claims that 90% of the reviews rated the mattress 5-stars. The mattress is able to relieve pressure points which prevents you from tossing and turning all night. The product will relieve shoulder, back and hip pain. The mattress is supposed to give you a delightful night of sleep.\nFeedback: The company did not tell the truth they said 90% of the reviews were 5-stars. There were 77% of the reviews that rated the product 5-stars. Oh, this is great because the customer receives the mattress and the customer opens the box and finds some of the seams on the mattress were ripping on a brand-new mattress. The delivery guy will not take the mattress back because it is opened. The customer needs to return the mattress. What are they supposed to do now? It sure seems like the company cannot be trusted because they lied about how many 5-star reviews they received for the product and now this customer receives a new mattress that has seams ripping.\nWe have taken a look at some mattresses that will help you if you are a side sleeper and they will help you sleep comfortably with no aches or pains when you wake up in the morning. One downside in the reviews is one of the company\u2019s lied about how many 5-stars reviewed they received for their mattress. It would be to a customer\u2019s advantage to avoid this company. You will see which company it is in the review list above.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T04:14:36Z", "url": "https://www.activebeautiful.com/best-mattress-for-side-sleepers/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "An autobiography of Fran Drescher.\nGreat surprise today with the mail!! I didn't expect the book to arrive this soon! Thanks for sending it, FamFatale!!! I'm looking forward to read it!!.\nI hope your book will arrive soon too!!!\nLeft the book in Switserland with a friend who wanted to read it too. After she's finished with it, the book will come back to me so I can read it myself.\nHave fun reading it, Irene!!\nSo, E-mile, the book comes back to you in Holland and thanks again!\nFran is back!!!! My friend from Switserland send me the book back; so now I can read it myself. She realy liked it, so I'm even more eager to read it than I already was!!!\nI just loved the book!!!!!\nFran tells her story with such humor.\ngood reading material it is.\nAgain thanks for the book, FamFatale!!\nAnd there was interest for a bookring! Today Fran will go to the first person in the ring: Arja.\nHave a safe and wonderful journey, Fran!!!\nE-mile mentioned this book and I thought it'd be interesting to read more about Fran's life. Might take a few weeks, as I suddenly had a pile of ring books arrive at the same time.\nI never realized how many other shows and films Fran Drescher must have worked on, before and during The Nanny. Also, I had not expected her to be so obnoxious and eccentric all the time in her behaviour and writing. IMHO this gets a bit annoying, even though that is who she is (or how she wants to present herself).\nE-mile, can you please tell me who to send the book to next?\nGister in de brievenbus gekregen via Arja. Hartelijk bedankt voor het langsbrengen. Ben er meteen in begonnen, was speciaal even in niets nieuws begonnen omdat ik wist dat ie eraan zat te komen. Ben benieuwd. Leuk dat het boek helemaal uit de US komt!\nWhat a lovely book to read and nice photo's too! Very funny. A real feel-good-story as far as I'm concerned, really liked it.\nShe sounds gratefull for the carrier she has and doesn't take her success for granted. I'll enjoy the episodes of The Nanny even more now I know the whole history and details behind it!\nI will bring the book to Tiekie this week asap.\nGot this book today from Pietenpadje. I am very looking forward to reading this book, so I will move my other books to a dark place and settle down tonight! Thank you E-mile for this lovely ring-book!!\nI am sending this book to the next person on the list. I have got no time to read it and I don't want to keep it here for too long.\nFran arrived on my doormat today!\nI'm really looking forward to reading this book.\nThanks for sending it Tiekie, and perhaps you can still read it after me?\nBy the way, nice to know that this book comes all the way from America!\nFinished it and what a fun book to read!\nAt times I really had to laugh out loud. And it's really written in her voice, literally... you actually hear her saying all these sentences!\nThe only thing that was nagging me whilst reading the book was the way she talked about her husband and her wonderful marriage... soon after this book was published they got divorced!!\nMaybe she wrote about that in her second book? I guess I have to read that as well!\nI'll contact Tiekie to ask if she has time to read it now, otherwise this book will be off to muizz.\nFran is on her way to Muizz!\nSorry for the late journal entry. I found the parcel in a stack of mail when I came home from a couple of days abroad and then I forgot to register it. Luckily Mirre sent me a reminder that she hadn't heard wether the book has arrived. Well, it has! Probably it will take some time before I am able to read it, because there are some other books screaming for attention as well.\nThanks for ringing the book, and Mirre, thanks for sending the book and for the reminder.\nImagine you are at a dinner party and the woman sitting next to you doesn't stop talking. She keeps on talking about her career, clothes, celebrities she's met, clothes, her succesful television show, clothes, her apearance at David Letterman shows and how funny she was there, clothes, etc. You don't want to be impolite and you make some encouraging noises, and in the mean time you are looking for a place to hide.\nThat's how I felt when reading this book. Normally I love (auto)biographies, but this one I didn't enjoy. Someone who is able to spend 6 pages about the preparations for a photo shoot (how her make up, hair and clothes were) can't keep my interest. I'm really sorry. Needless to say that I didn't finish this book.\nNow the book will continue its journey. It'll go to Sarana.\nWhat a lovely and funny book! I've read it while spending the Easter weekend with my parents and I kept calling out to them \"Ooo, did you know that...\" and \"You've got to hear this...\". I had no idea that so much about The Nanny was based on Fran's own life. I loved her stories, especially the down-to-earth-ness of them, and the fact that she wasn't afraid to tell her silliest stories or show her most unflattering pictures... A very sympathetic woman, as far as you can tell through this book.\nI'm shocked to read in Mirre's Journal Entry that she's divorced now, the way she describes her marriage it's hard to believe that it fell apart soon afterwards!\nThanks for ringing the book, E-mile! I'm PM'ing Nandaaah now.\nEdit: I'm terribly sorry for the long delay, the book was mailed out today.\nAnd the book has arrived, just started in another, so I'll probably start in this book somewhere in the next week.\nI've finished the book today in the hot sun. It was an O.K. book to read.\nJust as Arja, I didn't know she did this many other shows and films. And too bad she divorced, since her mariage seems good in the book, but unexpecting things can happen. The book will be off to the next reader as soon as I got an adress to send it to.\nAnd I got the book now! Thanx Nandaaah for sending it and E-mile for ringing (?) it. I allready started in it because my last book was just finished. Fun to know that her parents and sister's names in the Nanny came out off real life. That Chester was her dog, I knew allready. I will try to finish it before the Castricum-meeting.\nGelukt! Geweldig van genoten! En nu The Nanny weer op tv is kijk ik toch met *iets* andere ogen. Bedankt voor het ringen E-mile. Ze komt morgen bij je terug.\n\"What I learned about myself, the depth of my relationships, and cancer -tests, treatment, recovery and follow-up- could fill a book. So here it is.\n* back to E-mile. <-- Fran is back home!!!!\nposted Fran today, so the ring can continue..\nFran has arrived in Gouda! I'm looking forward to reading this book and am pleased to see it has pictures in it! Is has been a while since I read a book containing pictures.\nHi guys, perhaps you already know it, but since a few weeks there is another comedy on RTL4 on sunday afternoon with/about Fran!! I saw it for the first time last sunday and wanted to let you know that it's out there.\nNa 'The Nanny' is Fran Drescher terug met een nieuwe komedie. In 'Living with Fran' is Fran een gescheiden vrouw die geniet van de nieuwe weg die haar leven is ingeslagen. Haar nieuwe liefde Riley is fantastisch, geweldig en jong, heel erg jong. Hun relatie is ingewikkeld vanwege het feit dat de kinderen van Fran bijna even oud zijn als hun nieuwe 'stiefvader'. Het nieuwe huishouden van Fran mag dan niet traditioneel zijn en soms heel lastig, toch weet ze zeker dat ze het niet anders zou willen doen.\n'Living with Fran', vanaf zondag 11 juni, 17.00 - 17.30 uur, RTL 4.\nToday Fran arrived at my doormat, together with 2(!) other books...Which makes the count of ringbooks that arrived here in 3 days: 7...I think I'll need to ask my boss for a reading leave-of-absense.\nAnyway, although not all the stories were equally entertaining I enjoyed reading the book. It was really written in her voice, like Mirre said!\nI can't wait to read the other book!\nThanks for re-opening the ring E-mile!\nI'll send it to Yinny asap!\nFound it in the mailbox yesterday!\nThank you, E-mile for sharing this book and Enitnaj for sending this book!\nYes, she is boasting about all the famous people she met, the people she knows, the clothes she wears, blablabla. But she does it so innocently, so charming, that it isn't (very) annoying.\nThis book is already on its way to the next reader.\nThe book is here! I'll start reading it right away, because the book I'm currently reading is not to my taste.\nThe book is badly damaged, I'll try to repair some of it.\nI never watched the Nanny because I dislike sitcoms and canned laughter, but this book was neat. Miss Drecher sure has a lot of energy!\nThanks for the sweet card you left me in the book Yinny! I'll keep using it as a bookmark.\nI'm mailing this book to Redfloor today. Happy reading!\nLag in mijn brievenbus. Ben heel erg benieuwd ernaar. Er zijn nog wel enkele boeken die eerst aan de beurt zijn. Dutch-flybabe, je hebt het keurig gerestaureerd! Dank ook voor de kaart.\nEdit: Ere wie ere toekomt, Dutch-flybabe heeft het boekje gerestaureerd, niet Yinny.\nWat een leuk boek om te lezen. Allereerst door het formaat. Het is een lekker kleine pocket met kleine letters. Het paste makkelijk in mijn tas, zelfs als deze al vol zat. Daardoor kon ik doorlezen in de trein. Alle boeken zouden in dit formaat verkrijgbaar moeten zijn.\nDaarnaast is het ook gewoon heel erg leuk om te lezen over het leven van een van mijn favoriete actrices. Heel grappig om te lezen dat haar eigen ouders ook Sylvia en Morty heten en dat er meer parallellen zijn. Fijn dat Fran uiteindelijk een succesvolle carriere heeft. Ik bekijk de Nanny nu met heel andere ogen. Ik ben benieuwd naar deel twee, al vermoed ik, gezien de inhoud, dat dat deel lang niet zo hilarisch zal zijn.\nHaven't read it yet but will so very soon. Thanx for sending it Redfloor!\nFran is on her way to Jordanne. Have fun!!\nI found it in my mailbox a few days ago! I think it'll be a quick read!\nThanks for ringing and sending it to me!\nOp de post naar de volgende lezer!\nHeb dit boek voordat ik op vakantie ging uitgelezen. Opzich leuk om te weten hoe de serie The Nanny er is gekomen en dat veel is gebaseerd op haar eigen ervaringen, maar dat idee van 'aan je hoofd zeuren' kreeg ik ook wel. Ik had het idee dat ik een verlengde versie van een verhaal over een ster in de Story of de Prive zat te lezen, eerlijk gezegd.\nHet boek is vandaag aangekomen.\nHet ziet er leuk uit, veel foto's.\nIk ga er gelijk in beginnen, was gisteren klaar met mijn vorige ringboek.\nDank je wel voor het opsturen en ringen!\ni received the book today.\nIt looks like a fun and nice book, i like the photo's in it.\nI am going to read it right now.\nThanks for sending it to me and thanks for this ring!\nInteressant boek om te lezen, het word ook wel makkelijk gemaakt met de foto's die erin zitten van haar leven.\nWat het gelijk ook weer leuker maakt om te lezen.\nIt is an intersting book to read.\nAlso to see the photo's that are inside the book.\nErg leuk om te lezen!! Leuke foto's, leuke manier van schrijven!!\nAnd Fran found her way back home again! Thanks for sending it, Bontekever! (btw: did you read the book? I haven't seen a journal entry of it....).", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T10:33:11Z", "url": "https://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/1543273", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "In the second book of the Harry Potter Series, \u201cThe Chamber of Secrets\u201d by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter finds out that he can communicate with snakes using the Parseltongue language.\nIn this challenge we will write a Python script to translate English to Parseltongue and vice-versa.\nTo encode a message into Parseltongue you need to insert the string sequence \u201csss\u201d between each character of your message. e.g.\nI can speak to snakes using Parseltongue.\nTo decode a message from Parseltongue remove the \u201csss\u201d character sequences by only keeping 1 character out of 4 from the encoded message.\nCheck the following code, which uses two subroutines (functions) called encode() and decode() to encode a message in Parseltongue or decode a message from Parseltongue. Both functions use a technique called string concatenation to add one letter at a time to the message or cypher being generated.\nDid you know? Encoding and decoding secret messages is a key application of Computer Science called cryptography. An encoded message is called a cipher.\nAs a wizard at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, Harry Potter often needs to decipher secret messages. In this set of challenges you will write Python subroutines to encode or decode secret messages using a range of techniques.\nThe Parseltongue coding technique described above is not very secure. It would be easy for anyone to look at a cipher text and to be able to find a way to decipher it without being told how to in the first instance.\nTo make this encryption technique more secure we will adapt the encode() function implemented in the trinket above. Instead of adding the string \u201csss\u201d after each character we will add three random letters.\nBy completing this challenge, we are going to learn how to use ASCII code when manipulating strings.\nYou will use the chr() and ord() python instructions to convert characters into ASCII code and vice versa.\nprint(chr(97)) would display the letter \u201ca\u201d on screen as 97 is the ASCII code for character \u201ca\u201d.\nprint(ord(\u201ca\u201d)) would display the 97 on screen as 97 is the ASCII code for character \u201ca\u201d.\nUse this code to tweak the the encode() function. The decode() function should not need to be updated and should still work with this new encryption technique.\nTest your code. Do you find the cipher text to be more secure?\nUsing this encryption techniques the cipher message is based on the actual message with the letters of the message appearing in reverse order. e.g.\nUsing this encryption technique, the same function can be used to both encode and decode a message.\nYour task is to implement one function used to encode/decode a message, applying the \u201cReversi formula\u201d.\nCreate two new functions to encode and decode two messages at the same time by intertwining each letter of these messages. Your encode() function will take two parameters, message1 and message2, and generate a cipher by intertwining each letter of both messages, one letter at a time.\nIn cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as shift cipher, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the message to encrypt is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.\nYou will find out more about this technique by following this link.\nCan you think of any other approach you could use to encrypt a message? You may combine several of the techniques listed above, as combining several techniques will make your cipher more difficult to decode hence it will be a lot more secure!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T22:44:21Z", "url": "https://www.101computing.net/parseltongue-encoder/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "The city of Augusta is located in Georgia near the state's border with South Carolina. It plays host to the Masters Tournament, the most lauded tournament in professional golf. Augusta is known for the Masters, but there are several other fascinating sides to this city. Here are five things you never knew about Augusta, home of the Masters.\nAugusta was Georgia\u2019s capital briefly during the American Revolution and then again from 1785 until 1795. In 1788, the Georgia state convention ratified the U.S. Constitution in the city. Georgia was the fourth state to ratify the Constitution and the first in the Deep South. Augusta wasn\u2019t chartered as a city until 1798, so it was actually Georgia\u2019s capital city before officially becoming a city itself.\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, who was in office from 1913 to 1921, was born in Virginia but grew up in Augusta. Born in 1856, Wilson lived in Augusta from 1858 to 1870. His father was the pastor of Augusta\u2019s First Presbyterian Church and his family owned a beautiful manse on Seventh Street. Wilson spent the \u201cformative years of his life\u201d in the city. He lived in Augusta during the Civil War and the Reconstruction before going to college in North Carolina. Today, you can visit his boyhood home, which is a National Historic Landmark and the oldest Presidential residence in the state. Guided tours begin on the hour every Thursday through Saturday.\nAugusta has been either the hometown or burial place of 10 Confederate generals \u2014 Brig. Gen. Edward P. Alexander, Maj. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright and Gen. Marcellus A. Stovall, among others. \u201cWhen the South needed generals during the Civil War, it often turned to Augustans,\u201d the Augusta Chronicle says. Today, you can see monuments all over the city that have been dedicated to these men.\nThe Masters wasn\u2019t always called the Masters; the title didn\u2019t come about until 1939. The tournament began in 1934 and was originally known as the Augusta National Invitational. That name didn\u2019t sound quite prestigious enough, however \u2014 so in 1939, the name was changed to the Masters.\nThe first-in-flight brothers from North Carolina brought their airplanes to Georgia. The Wright Flying School was in business from 1910 to 1916. During that time, it taught 119 people to fly Wright airplanes. The main location of the school was in Alabama and then moved to Ohio. Trying to take advantage of the warm winters in the South, the Wrights also opened a seasonal facility in Augusta in 1911. It was run by Frank Coffyn, an aviator who was a member of the Wright Exhibition Team after the Wright brothers taught him to fly.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T19:10:07Z", "url": "https://www.traveltrivia.com/surprising-facts-about-augusta-masters/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Sometimes it is the things you see every day which inspire you. A colour or texture catches your eye, and you're hooked. The itch starts, and you find you have to paint it. Whatever it might be. This happened for me a couple of years ago, when I was working with the lovely Vital Veg at Midmar. Every week I packed beautiful, colourful veg into veg bags for customers. Some of the veg came home with me. And some of that came with me to the weekly art class I was attending.\nAnother influence fed into this process. A few years ago, I attended a workshop with Sofia Perina-Miller, whose work I also greatly admire. She paints fabulous striking flowers, as well as many other subjects. She showed us how to paint directly onto paper, without doing any initial drawing. This was an entirely new experience for me - and I found that I loved the freedom of it! Instead of feeling constrained by the pencil lines, I was \"free\" to paint directly, loosely, using vibrant colours, which resulted in more lively work. Sofia usually adds meticulous pen and ink details to her work. I left mine as they were; as I may have mentioned before I have rather limited patience!\nThere is always a certain amount of fear involved in painting this way. I had to learn to be brave, to trust that the colours I was choosing and the marks I was making were strong and true and confident. This was no time for fiddling around with details and tentative marks. Before I started, I would look carefully at the veg, get a feel for the overall shape and size and proportions, the main colours, the shadows on the paper. Really look, and get a feel for it. It helped to stand up, to have everything I needed to hand and to just do it, quickly. I love this way of working; writing this makes me want to do some more of this kind of work.\nSome of my veg paintings are available as digital downloads from my Etsy shop.\nVarious items (prints, mugs, phone covers, tote bags etc.) sporting my veg paintings can also be found on Redbubble.\nI often make soup. At the organic veg farm where I work part-time, we take it in turns to bring a pot of soup to the veg shed on the day we pack veg bags for customers. One of the things I love about soup is that it is very forgiving. You can throw just about anything into it and it is usually pretty tasty and good. (The only exception seems to be kiwi fruit, which a friend reminded me of today - that did not turn out well. I do quite often put apple or pear in soup though, lends a lovely sweetness). Most of us who takes turns with the soup pot admit to making \"bottom of the fridge\" soup, with whatever is left and is maybe looking a little tired. Some celery, onion, a courgette, a bit of broccoli, the odd kale leaf and some carrots - add ham stock, a tin of chopped tomatoes and hey presto, it's minestrone! Minestrone is one of my favourites and yet I don't recall having it at home when I was a child. We had broth (not a favourite; I disliked the gloopy texture of the barley), and homemade tomato soup with lots of carrots and was it sago, perhaps, to thicken it? My favourite was cucumber soup, creamy and buttery and delicious. My dad loved consomme, hot or cold (brown meaty jelly with chopped chives on top). We had chicken soup too, made using a boiling fowl, with rice and leeks and chopped parsley from the garden to garnish it. We used to laugh at Mum, who would make soup from the peapods after the sweet garden peas had been shelled from them. \"Is that grass soup?\" we would ask. I quite often produce \"green soup\" of slightly dubious origins myself, these days, so I can now appreciate the greenness of her ways.\nIt's a real comfort food. And not just the eating of it, or supping of it, but the act of making it. I remember retreating to the kitchen of my mother-in-law's house the day after my father-in-law died very suddenly, over 25 years ago now. We went to stay with her, with our six month old son. To try to help; to organise the funeral, make endless cups of tea for people who came in to offer condolences; to try and make sense of it all. All I could do was make soup. I chopped and stirred and added stock. I left it to simmer, tasted it, ladled it into bowls for whoever wanted some. It seemed to help. It helped me, to feel I was providing comfort, of sorts. I think I maybe even baked. There was comfort in it for me too. Just the rhythm of washing and peeling and chopping, stirring and tasting and serving. Life going on, in some small way.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T04:34:48Z", "url": "http://www.jenniferjwatson.com/news/category/vegetables", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "In China, the prevalence of tooth decay among 12-year-olds increased nearly 35 percent from 2005 to 2015. While most parents still believe that good dental hygiene means brushing teeth twice a day, dental professionals suggest that neglecting timely oral care after meals contributes to the problem. Wrigley\u2019s Extra Sugar-Free Gum wanted to inspire Chinese parents to encourage their children to chew sugar-free gum after meals, which can help prevent tooth decay and improve oral health.\nWe tapped into Chinese school children\u2019s daily lunch routines and created the first interactive lunchbox that encourages children to practice oral hygiene after meals \u2014 Extra Care Box.

{"text": "Thanks to @Citi Foundation #ProgressMakers, Lesbia makes her career dream a reality!\nWhen Lesbia was very young, her parents made a difficult decision. They wanted a better future for their family, so they moved from Central America to the U.S. to find it.\nDuring that period, her parents were back and forth between the countries, and Lesbia rarely saw them. Six years later, she finally joined them on American soil.\nWhen she started school, Lesbia couldn\u2019t speak English. Other kids made fun of her name. She struggled.\nBut eventually, she learned to stop caring what other people thought. She realized that this new country held a wealth of opportunities.\nAs time went on and they worked to adjust to the U.S., other members of Lesbia\u2019s family found Hispanic Unity of Florida (HUF). They referred her, and after obtaining a work permit, she was able to get temporary child care assistance at HUF.\nHUF changed Lesbia\u2019s life. She was supported by multiple HUF programs, including Income Support, Financial Literacy, and the Bridge Program, where she completed the Customer Service and Sales Training, as well as the Patient Care Technician EKG/Phlebotomy Training. She\u2019s currently finishing a class in math at Sheridan Technical School, and has a bright future.\nThanks to HUF, Lesbia\u2019s family will no longer live paycheck to paycheck, and she, her husband, and her children will live better lives.\nThe Bridge Program at Hispanic Unity opens up a world of opportunities! With the generous support of @Citi Foundation and the Community #ProgressMakers grant, program participants have access to tuition assistance for career pathways in high demand fields, including national certifications in Patient Care Technician (PCT) and Customer Service and Sales Training (CSST).\nThanks to @Citi Foundation #ProgressMakers, Marisol makes her dream a reality!\nFrom Boston, to Puerto Rico, to Miami, Marisol has been following her American dream since birth.\nBorn in Boston, she spent several years in the historic city before her family relocated to Puerto Rico, where she grew up and attended school.\nAs an adult, Marisol made the difficult decision to move to Florida in search of a better future for her family. She sought more safety and security. Marisol was excited and deeply committed to grow and thrive in her new home!\nStarting fresh presented numerous challenges, however. She struggled to find work while caring for her two beloved children.\nLuckily, Marisol found Hispanic Unity of Florida. Her brother had participated in HUF\u2019s Center for Working Families program and referred her.\nMarisol took the many opportunities offered by HUF and ran with them. She received income support through gift cards, child care assistance, hurricane relief help, and affordable housing. She also entered the Bridge Program where she became certified through HUF\u2019s Customer Service and Sales Representative (CSR) training.\nShortly thereafter, she was able to secure part-time employment. Marisol says that the training helped her be more in touch with clients and better understand their needs.\nThe hard-working mother wanted to take things further and thrive in a new career, so she completed HUF\u2019s Patient Care Technician Program (PCT) at Sheridan Technical College \u2013 a highly specialized training with a focus on EKG and Phlebotomy.\nCountless new opportunities are now available to Marisol, and she plans to move on into the Licensed Practical Nursing (LPN) Program. Eventually, she\u2019ll work in a private practice, and she credits HUF for helping her to empower herself and help ensure her family\u2019s successful future.\nThe Urban Institute recently released a research report titled Upskilling the Immigrant Workforce to Meet Employer Demand for Skilled Workers.\nThe report takes a look at the whole US but supplements its findings through site visits and interviews with a variety of stakeholders in three metro areas, Seattle, Dallas and Miami-Fort Lauderdale.\nHispanic Unity of Florida (HUF) participated in the study and shared with the researchers our own insights into the work we do assisting immigrants who are both unemployed as well as, underemployed.\nHow many of us know that Broward County\u2019s percentage of foreign-born residents is nearly 33% \u2013 or 3 out every 10 residents?\nThe implications are significant for our community. Our immigrant population is mostly first generation. And the needs of this population are different then communities where the immigrants are second or third generation or where the immigrants are English literate and highly educated.\nLocal communities with large foreign born residents must invest in foundational resources to assist these immigrants in their integration \u2013 which in turn \u2013 benefits the whole community.\nAt HUF where we serve immigrants from 30 different nations, our work is focused on English language instruction, education (for both parents and children), economic development (employment, small business creation, asset building, health and child care supports) and civic engagement.\nThis from the research report: This diversity within the immigrant workforce\u2014with high numbers at both ends of the educational spectrum\u2014is important context for our focus in this report on opportunities for immigrants employed in lower- and middle-skilled jobs.\nAt HUF, we simultaneously work with former professionals such as doctors, dentists, lawyers, etc. as well as individuals who never completed high school. This diversity within the immigrant community requires different approaches to the work community organizations such as HUF undertakes. For us, it means providing core services that are fundamental to all clients while providing \u201cadd-ons\u201d such as information on how to have educational credentials certified for immigrants with college or advanced degrees.\n\u201cOne out of every six workers in the US are immigrants.\u201d The research report\u2019s conclusions offers guidance for all our community\u2019s stakeholders: state and local policy makers, workforce development service providers, funders and employers. Woven throughout the report are the community based organizations that are often at the frontlines of the work with immigrants.\nSouth Florida is at full employment. Now is the time to support and address the needs of our whole community including communities of color and the immigrant community.\nThis article was originally published on June 6, 2018 on the UnidosUS website.\nAs of this posting, Florida is the only state in the nation to not have a federally approved accountability plan.\nOn April 20, 2018, the Florida Department of Education (FDOE) submitted its revised Florida Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Plan to the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE).\nHispanic Unity of Florida is a member of a coalition of civil rights organizations that earlier this year during Florida\u2019s Legislative Session, proposed legislation that would align Florida\u2019s school accountability system with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the largest federal law governing K-12 education. Florida\u2019s current system neglects to factor into its school grades the test scores of many English learner (EL) and Latino students, and fails to use a native language assessment when appropriate for the 10% of Florida\u2019s K-12 students who are learning English.\nEffective implementation of ESSA at the state and district level is key to ensuring that educators and ELs have the data and tools they need to become English proficient and academically successful as swiftly as possible.\nUnder ESSA, in exchange for federal funds, states must track and report the performance of subgroups of students\u2014racial and ethnic minorities, those from low-income families, ELs, and those with disabilities\u2014when assessing school performance.\nFlorida\u2019s revised ESSA plan, however, sidesteps the intent of the federal law by bundling together the lowest-performing students regardless of subgroup. That means schools that are not meeting the needs of every subgroup can still get a passing grade, and parents are not aware.\nThe revised Florida plan creates the new \u201cFederal Percent of Points Earned Index\u201d (FPPEI) of which subgroup performance and an English Language Proficiency Indicator will be components. The fact that Florida created the FPPEI is a good sign that the state recognizes its obligation to align the state\u2019s system with federal law. The FPPEI, a new section of a Florida school\u2019s report card, in effect creates a parallel accountability system. The calculation of a school\u2019s grade still does not take into account subgroup performance and English language proficiency. This decision is problematic, confusing and unnecessary.\nWhat\u2019s more, while the federal government urges states, when appropriate, to test students in their native language to better assess what they know\u2014Florida chose not to meet this requirement, despite being home to one of the nation\u2019s largest EL population.\nA recent report by UnidosUS (formerly NCLR) study highlights that Florida educates the third-largest K\u201312 EL population in the nation. ELs make up 10% of Florida\u2019s student population; nearly 290,000 students. The majority of ELs\u201475%\u2014in the state speak Spanish. According to recent Florida state assessment results, double-digit gaps exist in graduation rates and academic achievement between ELs and their non\u2013EL peers.\nAs a result of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, it is estimated that Florida is now home to between 10,000 to 12,000 Puerto Rican students. While these students are American citizens, they also are predominately ELs.\nFor more information about ESSA and education issues impacting the Latino community, visit unidosus.org and UnidosUS\u2019s education-focused website, Progress Report: Ensuring the Success of All Students.\nHave conversations about ESSA with parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, candidates and state elected officials. Bring up the \u201cAdvocate Questions\u201d in the conversation.\nEngage parents and other stakeholders in your area by hosting an ESSA meeting at your school or a community-based organization.\nFollow and Vote: Follow what local and statewide candidates have to say about education. Vote for candidates in the Primary Election on August 28, 2018, and the General Election, November 6, 2018 who are committed to all K-12 students.

In 2017, more than 5,000 eligible students attended classes at HUF and at partnering Broward and Miami-Dade libraries, and more than 30 trained volunteers contributed more than 2,300 hours as instructors last year.\nThe Pathways to Citizenship program led by the Office of New Americans (ONA) of Miami-Dade County and Hispanic Unity of Florida, Inc. is a county-wide initiative made possible with the support from our Corporate Founding Partner Citi Community Development and the generosity of the JPMorgan Chase Foundation.

{"text": "Hair updo styles. Pictures of updo hairstyles.\nAre you looking at a more sophisticated hair updo style for your wedding or prom? If so, we have a great collection of examples that will help you find the right look. Our examples focus on women who have somewhat longer hair that can be used in dramatic fashion. Here you will find a number of updo hairstyles from those close to casual to others that push the boundaries and make an unforgettable impression. The first row of examples is highlighted by the third photo which features a complicated pinned up style, yet has enough play to make it attractive. The second photo is a great example of how bangs can be used to really highlight the face while still having the rest of the hair updo pinned back. Naturally, augmenting your hair with natural decorations such as flowers can make for a great way to set your style apart. In the second row we see more classic examples of sophisticated wedding and prom updo styles. While the first example is perfect for those with very curly hair, the third and fourth are pure classic updo\u2019s perfect for more formal occasions. If you have long, thick hair, then you might want to try the example in the second photo to highlight your face. The third row is a great combination of pulled back styles along with loose, more casual feel. The second example does require some work and spray, but the results are perfect for weddings. For younger women, especially those attending the prom the first and fourth photos provide excellent examples of what can be done. For the final row we have another combination of both casual and pinned up hair that you can choose from when attending the wedding or prom.

So I started googling to see if there was any challenges already out there that did what I was looking for. A few that I found wasn't really what I was looking for. I wanted to also create all the rabbit hole lots along with the residential lots with out having to move into each house and leave other sims behind. I didn't want to have to repopulate the whole town with just my sim either so I decided to create my own. So here is what I have come up with so far.\nI was requested to write down the rules for this challenge so here are the challenge rules!\nYour sim has come from an over crowded town with lots of noise and pollution. They have traveled far away from any civilization and has settled here to start over from scratch. This area has no buildings, no houses and no residents. This is a great place for your sim to start over in life and build everything from scratch from the ground up.\nPick any world you like and go into Edit Town and delete every house and building. This includes any rabbit holes.\nPick your sim either by creating new or a preexisting one.\nYour lifespan can be what ever you want, I suggest a long one. I'm using a fairy so I have a very long life span.\nYour sim will not have a job to start out with so you will need to make money in other ways like fishing, searching for flowers or gems to sell.\nOnce your sim has some money you can do other things to make money as well like painting, photography, writing for example.\nOnce some job buildings are placed you can have your sim have a job along with previous mentions of money making activities.\nYour sim can buy properties or become business owners to make money as well.\n~When you build the house to rent, you don't need to build with your own money otherwise your sim will end up spending double the cost. Build the house then go in and have your sim rent it out.\n~Once a residential lot has been created for a certain category, you can add to it later as long as it doesn't take it out of it's original category; for example: a starter home changing to a family home.\nThere can be NO residents living in the town until there is a house sufficient enough for them to live.\nFor example: must have fridge, toilet, bed and shower/tub along with all flooring and wallpapers in the home as well.\nOnce there is a place for a sim to move in, you can move any sim in you want or an immigrant can move in. No Immigrants are aloud to move into any empty lots so make sure they are all set to no visitors until a residential lot is built.\nAll community and residential lots must be built by your sim.\nAll Parks must be built by your sim.\nAll active job's that need a building need to be built by your sim.\nYour sim can have any personal life you choose. Once there are residents living in your town, your sim can date, get married, have children or your sim can live alone for their entire life. However you choose.\nAny community lot can be combined with another community lot. For example, a tattoo parlor can be built with a salon. More than two can be built together which comes in handy when your not working with very many lots in the world or it's a small island. If you do not have an expansion pack that has one of the requirement builds listed above that is okay.\nYou can only fail the challenge if one thing were to happen, your sim dies before the above requirements are met.\nThere is a possibility of any of these rules changing as I go along in my video series as I have not tested out this challenge. Any ideas or suggestions or if I missed anything in the rules are welcome!\nLet me know how this challenge is going for you!\nI started a game similar to this and had to place a few community lots and my town's main library has a city hall rabbit hole rug for editing the chances of alien abductions resulting in pregnancies.I placed skill requiremnents for aditional building and they also have to build their house first before any other buildings get built in edit town.I also did require lots for new families to have a mailbox,trash bin. wall section,burglar alarm,fire alarm,sleeping bags and laptop computers though cheap ones.The founders have to get a house built before winter arrives and survive their first winter before adding to their house and they also have to start growing plants on their lot before the second winter and new families could begin arriving the following year in late spring or early summer.I allow chess tables and martial arts equipment to start showing up after a second household is in town.Building is based on donations on community lots or taxes collected from incomes.\nI made a change in the rules when it comes to building the house you want to rent out to your town.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T16:50:04Z", "url": "http://qbaliki.modthesims.info/showthread.php?t=617825", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "It's safe to say that the past two weeks have been the most difficult that Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and the Labour-led Government have faced.\nBetween the sexual assaults at a Young Labour summer camp, the entire Russia fiasco, Ron Mark melting down over defence force flights, Jenny Salesa's Ministerial spending, criticism that not enough was being down to help the Nelson and Tasman regions in their recovery from Cyclone Gita, the Green Party ambushing Labour by announcing they were gifting questions to National, and Shane Jones repeatedly shoving his foot in his mouth over Air New Zealand, there's a lot that's been going wrong lately.\nThe public relations triumph that was Ardern's Waitangi visit must seem like an age ago, while the successful Pacific Mission has completely vanished from view.\nDespite all that, when the next round of political polling is released I don't expect to see any significant change from what we saw in February. I'd expect to see Labour in the mid to high 40s, National in the mid to low 40s, and the Greens and New Zealand First struggling to reach 5 per cent.\nThe main reason for this is that Ardern hasn't been personally responsible for many of the issues that have played out and, where she has, they've mostly been on things that I don't think are necessarily going to sway voters. That, combined with her personal popularity, will mean that while Ardern has burnt some political capital fighting fires, she still has a deep well of support to call on.\nThe Labour Party's seemingly terrible handling of the sexual assaults at the Waihi camp will reflect badly on Labour's General Secretary Andrew Kirton, but as Ardern was only briefly at the camp delivering a speech, and had nothing to do with its organisation or the events in question, I doubt any voters will hold her responsible for it. A test may come further down the line when Labour's own internal investigation is complete if it finds significant failings on the part of the party organisation and Ardern doesn't demand that someone takes personal responsibility, but that's hard to preempt given there's a lot of water to go under the bridge.\nThe Russia fiasco - Winston Peters' alternative facts on Russian interference with the US election and Russian involvement in the downing of MH17, the bizarre focus of Peters on a Russian free trade deal, and the ham-fisted attempt by the Government to first condemn the Salisbury attack without blaming Russia, then several days later finally managing to step into line with our allies and blame Russia, as well as Ardern's bungled attempts to spin away that foreign policy disaster - while a bad look generally for Ardern and Peters, isn't the type of issue that will sway votes, even if it has lead to some questioning within the beltway of Ardern's own judgement and Peters' motives.\nWhat has been interesting is that the Russia saga played out over 11 days. If a day is a long time in politics, then 11 days is an eternity for an issue like this to run its initial course. There's possibly more to come in this space, which could start to erode voter confidence in the Government's foreign policy and security credentials.\nRon Mark's defence force flights and Jenny Salesa's ministerial spending are similarly both minor issues. In the bigger scheme of things both are relatively minor issues. While Mark hasn't handled the pressure being questioned about the flights put him under particularly well, Ardern did the requisite telling off of Salesa and unless it becomes a pattern of overspend, the matter will rest there.\nOne thing that will nag at Labour's recovery of support in the regions, at least in the top of the South Island, has been the Government's sluggish response to Cyclone Gita in Nelson and Tasman. It took nearly three weeks after Cyclone Gita hit New Zealand for the Government to announce any meaningful assistance for businesses cut off by the storm. And unlike the flooding in Edgecumbe, which prompted a Prime Ministerial visit from Bill English to see first hand what had unfolded, the residents of Takaka and the surrounding areas still haven't seen or heard from Ardern.\nNot that anyone is suggesting a Prime Minister visiting is somehow going to magically undo the damage done by a given disaster, but it usually serves as both a way to boost morale in the affected communities, as well as to highlight the ongoing importance of the recovery to Government agencies to ensure they keep their efforts up.\nThe Green Party surprising everyone by gifting questions in Question Time to National has been an interesting issue to follow the reaction to. While it feeds the Opposition's narrative that not all is well and cozy on the Government benches, any consequential reaction to it seems to be more directed at the Green Party over it, both supportive of the move and in opposition to it. While headlines of the Greens doing a deal with National aren't helpful to Labour, it seems unlikely this will translate into the polls either.\nFinally, there was Shane Jones' attack on Air New Zealand. It kicked off on Friday and didn't end until Ardern finally hauled Jones back into line during Question Time on Wednesday. Jones' comments caused some concern in both the beltway and business community, as did Ardern's initial backing of Jones. Outside of the beltway, Jones' comments will have played well.\nTowards the end of the past two weeks Ardern was getting visibly frustrated with both media questioning and Opposition attacks. In part this will stem from this being the first time her Government has been hauled over the coals for a significant length of time. But no doubt a lot of her annoyance will come from the fact that most of the problems she's been having to deal with aren't ones that she's been responsible for, barring her poor handling of the Russia issue.\nThe rough patch is set to continue too. With the Select Committee submissions soon to be heard on the Electoral Integrity Amendment Bill, there will be a stream of negative headlines about the Government pushing that Bill through, as well as the Green Party's support for it. There's also lingering questions around Winston Peters' infatuation with Putin's Russia.\nIt shouldn't escape anyone's notice that New Zealand First, who are struggling badly in polls, have been the source of three of the issues that have dogged the Government in the past two weeks. Shane Jones' comments are perhaps the most interesting in this regard, as they point towards New Zealand First taking a much more vocal stand on issues that might not always sit well with the responsibilities and requirements of occupying the Government benches.\nThe good news for Labour is that with Easter fast approaching, and beyond that the beginning of pre-Budget announcements, the Government does have an opportunity to start setting the news agenda rather than reacting to it.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T13:07:11Z", "url": "https://www.libertas.digital/blog/tag/Ron+Mark", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The two main islands of the Region, Evia and Skyros, are pole of tourist attraction.\nSterea Ellada is the industrial centre of Greece, nevertheless it has rural areas too. It is worth noting that only 3% of the total area is residential. The main mountainous area of Sterea Ellada is formed around its centre. Forests cover the 25% of the total regional area, while 2% is covered by water. The cultivated areas of the region occupy the 26% of total area, while the 43% is used in farming activities.

Moreover, activites related to the tertiary sector account for the 43% of the regional GDP and gravitate mostly real estate and public services. The tourism sector, on the other hand, counts up only for the 4,4% of the regional GDP and is less developed than the national average, however, it has great potential for further growth due to the region\u2019s natural hot springs and spa (Kamena Vourla, Edipsos), archaeological sites and geographic location.\nThe agricultural sector counts up only for the 8% percent of the regional GDP% and is estimated to be subject of further decline in the future. Rural activities concentrate in the production of olive oil, wheat, fruits and vegetables, as well as in the breeding of livestock.

I have been on a journey to discover who I am as a mom and how to be a present and mindful mom from the day my first daughter was born. At age 48, now a mom of three teenager daughters, I am still on that journey and always searching for ways to simplify and appreciate the time I spend with them. Ali Katz has given me valuable tips and direction that I can use as I continue my journey.\nThis book focuses on ways for a mom to explore herself and take care of herself in order to find balance and give her best self to her own children. By using certain tips and principles, through meditation, personal experiences and simple acts of kindness to name a few details in the book, Hot Mess to Mindful Mom enabled me to become even more realistic and mindful.\nBy relating to some of Ali\u2019s experiences I felt engaged with her like I was having a personal conversation with a fellow mom. She is very forthcoming and helpful in showing me new ways to explore something deeper. I truly believe she gave me valuable information and techniques that I can use to strengthen myself as a mom.\nI was familiar with many challenges Ali faced on her own journey and she was able to fill me with great advice and help. Ali expresses so openly how she has learned to be grateful and forgiving. This allowed her and will allow other moms to overcome fears and doubts and to become happier, which in turn, helps them become better moms.\nAs shown in the book, every mom is on a journey from the day the child arrives and never ends. Ali Katz, in her book a Hot Mess to a Mindful Mom, we get to experience her journey and learn, as she did, how to grow deeper in ourselves and become a little bit better each and every day in order to enjoy the simple times with our children and spread our happiness to them.\nHot Mess to Mindful Mom is available at amazon.com.\nThis guest post is by Kelley Beckham.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T10:24:57Z", "url": "https://www.modernmom.com/hot-mess-to-mindful-mom-book-review-110772.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Show of hands for everyone that's been confused by the relationship between Wes and Annalise on How to Get Away with Murder . Since the first episode of the series, Annalise has taken a liking to Wes and no one knows why. Is Wes Annalise's son? Is Annalise attracted to Wes? A lot of theories have been thrown out into the ring. On Thursday's episode of HTGAWM, Annalise told Eve \"it's him\" when speaking about Wes, so basically I'm taking that as a big thumbs up on the mother/son relationship, even though that seems too easy for a show this convoluted.\nDuring an intimate scene between Eve and Annalise, who go way back, Eve questions why Annalise is protecting Wes, who is just a student. Annalise tells Eve that Wes is not just some student. \"It's him,\" Annalise tells Eve, who immediately knows what she's talking about. You know who doesn't know what she's talking about? Me. And everyone else in this world who is too emotionally and mentally invested in this god forsaken show.\nEve tells Annalise that she is a very good person, making it seem like whatever secret correlation Wes and Annalise have has caused distress on Annalise. So all signs point to Wes being Annalise's son. But, how does that fit into Wes' life timeline? We know that Wes had a rough start as a kid. He didn't have a father in his life and his mother killed herself when he was a young teen, but what if Annalise's connection to Wes comes before all of that?\nOne Reddit user believes that Annalise could be Wes' biological mother, but gave him up for adoption as a baby because she got pregnant at a high point in her career where she didn't want to take care of a baby. Now, she brought him back into her life the only way Annalise Keating knows how (manipulation, power, etc.) and is finally being the mother figure she never got to be for him. It's a stretch, but it's also possible with the few clues we have been given.\nMy only concern with the mother theory is that it almost seems too easy. For a while, people have been speculating that Wes and Annalise are related. Hell, I think one of the other students made a joke about it at one point. Because of this, I'm not sure if the producers would write in such an expected storyline. They're so good at steering their viewers one way with bait, and then switching directions at the last second.

{"text": "After a hot hot hot spruce bath and some linden/elderflower infusion I find myself in bed, floating through worlds, my bones burning and my mind drfiting up and up. Alternating between hot and cold with one sock halfway off I am dreaming and tossing about, waking occasionally to feebly reach for water or a lymphatic tincture.\nIt\u2019s a fever dream, and I\u2019m giving my body space to heal itself. After getting the un-fabulous advice, at a party, that \u201csudafed and benadryl are good for sinus infections\u201d I find myself musing on what we\u2014mothers, healers, our culture\u2013have given up. If we pop a sudafed-tm-every time we fall ill we are denying ourselves the opportunity to build our OWN knowledge about the human body. This fever is giving me information about myself. It is giving me words and phrases, showing me my fears and my strengths.\nI believe that it is part of life to fall ill, to feel our blood ice up and our brain catch fire. How else can we know what is possible? How can sudafed teach us what healing means?\nAnd every time I hear folks ask me what they can do to avoid illness I tell them that illness is an opportunity. Some of my favorite healers are seekers who see illness as a learning experience. Our wisdom is hard-won and comes from hands-on experience which sometimes gets messy. Illness teaches us how to support healing, how to get out of the way of healing, and puts the knowledge and the feeling into our own hands, puts the power into us. Popping wal-mart echinacea pills every day is a suppressive technique. Taking unnecessary medications (natural or pharmaceutical) to suppress symptoms is not \u201chealing\u201d.\nI find my best healing comes from movement. Moving the lymphatics, moving mucous, moving stuck energy, activating digestion. Allowing the fever to do its\u2019 job inside of us.\nBecause all of life is a learning opportunity. Hot weather is an opportunity to feel hot. Cold weather is an opportunity to feel cold. Discomfort is a gift which gives us the chance to learn what tools we have, as humans, to help ourselves and to support our bodies\u2019 natural processes. We are so eager to dry humidity and make ice less slippery that we never understand what humidity feels like, or what slippery really means. We do not KNOW hot or cold. We do not SEEK to know.\nThe way that we are giving our own power away harms us, and our children too. It rewards people and corporations who will give us comfort at any cost. Those who can learn to accept some basic discomfort as a normal part of life will be prepared for whatever may happen. Allowing our children to feel a fever\u2019s heat and chills is a gift which teaches them not to fear their bodies.\nIt is my wish to ride my fever like a surfer, accepting the fear, facing the mortality of my body. Because more so than those without fear, it is those who feel the fear then do it anyway who build power and wisdom. Neither sudafed nor benadryl will give a speck of wisdom or empowerment to us, and they will never teach us about our bodies capacity to heal itself.\nNOTE: this was scriblled on my bedsite notebook during a fever. if that is what YOU consider \u201cmedical advice\u201d, fine. however, it should be clear that i do NOT intend this to be medical advice!!!!!!!!\nNICE nice article!

{"text": "According to the study targeted on a group of 38 adult cats, which has lasted for four years, cats eat more food in the season of winter therefore, their owners should provide the pets with cat-food during this period of time.\nIn order to find the new way to enhance milk production, seasonal food intake by dairy cows has been tested in the past. However, this study involved in domestic cats is the largest of its kind so far.\nThe group of 38 cats coming from mixed breeds, ages and genders were kept at a center in France, where they were free to do whatever they preferred outdoors all year round.\nWith a microchip on their collar, the cats were able to get as much food as they needed from a dispenser, which would be opened just the group of cats. Simultaneously, such microchip could make a record how much food the cat had taken and when it did.\nAs Dr Alex German from the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom, explained in the paper paper published in the latest edition of PLoS ONE, like many humans, cats are likely to have comfort eating in the cold weather outside.\nHowever, from their study, Dr Alex German and his team found the main reason for that is the extra energy cats needed to maintain warmness when they were outside for outdoor activities. In addition, Dr German\u2019s team also confirmed that cats ate about 15 per cent less food during summer.\nIn his conclusion, Dr Alex German stated that the swing in activity levels during the year might be closely linked with the extra effort to maintain warmness in winter and the temptation to rest during hot days in summer.\nSo it is suggested that the amount of food the cats take at different times of year should carefully considered by their keepers, because it is important to allow cats to have a healthy weight.\nHey Puppy, Please Get Along with That Kitty!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T00:53:34Z", "url": "http://www.aintanerd.com/study-says-domestic-cats-consume-more-in-winter/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "There is a huge potential for energy saving in the life support systems (LSS). For comparison, in industrial systems the potential savings range between 30% and 40%. In the aquarium world, dealing with a delicate organic process in which parameters can change, good results should also be expected. A large amount of the energy is consumed by pumps. Therefore a first logical step for energy saving lies in determining the pumps duty point(s). Pumps are the backbone of the aquarium, creating the needed water movement in the exhibits and feeding the LSS. The pumps\u2019 delivery head must be enough to over-come all resistance losses caused by pipe work, appendages, protein skimmer, sand filters and so on. During pump selection safety margins are added in ensure that flow required in the design is realised. Nowadays, for getting flexibility in pump performance and to avoid throttling of the system, the use of variable frequency drive (VFD) is widely used. However, the use of VFD can have unexpected effects on the LSS system. When pumps deviates more to the right of their Best Efficiency Point (BEP), the grade of efficiency can decrease and Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) will diminish, giving way to higher risks of vibration (including cavitation) and noise. Then, mechanical pump load will increase, speeding up the maintenance frequency, causing more down time of the LSS which will have an impact on the controllability of the LSS. In addition, pipe work and its components will face more mechanical impact, increasing the risk of cracking pipes, giving way to failures like super-saturation.\nThere are a number of factors to consider when planning a new aquarium facility. One of the most important factors to consider is how will aquarium seawater will be supplied? Most inland facilities are obligated to make their own saltwater, but facilities located adjacent to natural seawater sources must evaluate collecting a continuous source of water. A source of good quality natural seawater can have a long term impact on operational cost as well as provide benefits to animal health. Important aspects to consider in the planning for a seawater intake for an aquarium facility are as follows: Where will the intake be located? The geographical location of the intake impacts the overall water quality that the intake will deliver. Things to consider include land based activities or industries, maritime traffic and freshwater intrusion sources such as natural stream beds or high capacity storm drains. Local and seasonal currents as well as tidal swings will also have an impact on the seawater intake location. What type of intake would be appropriate for the facility? There are number of different ways to intake seawater for use at an aquarium facility. This includes sea floor pipelines, pier based pump stations, land based pump stations, seawater wells and rainy collectors. Different methods and examples of facilities using similar methods will be discussed. Logistics, capital costs and long term operational costs all play a role in the method selected. What is the water quality of the source water? Is it suitable for use in the Aquarium facility? The seawater quality for any intake will vary by season and by day depending on a number of different things. Seasonal water quality samples can help the decision making process in regard to suitability and the treatment regime required. Water bodies that are high in pollutants may not be acceptable for use in the aquarium, forcing a seaside facility to manufacture seawater or obtain good quality seawater in other ways such as by truck or barge. Regulatory requirements will impact both the seawater intake and the discharge facilities. Local regulatory agency requirements vary from location to location and fall under the umbrella of national regulations as well. Discharge regulations focus on water quality parameters such as concentrations of oxidants, suspended solids, BOD and bacteria counts. At times discharge water quality parameters are lower than the water quality that you may see at the seawater intake itself. Chloride limits by local sewer agencies can also come into play in facility planning.\nDuring a recent renovation, the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Center (VAMSC) installed a District Energy System or DES for short. VAMSC is one of only a few institutions in British Columbia to integrate such an innovative system to manage energy use. VAMSC follows LEED and ISO 14001 construction practices and in 2015 was awarded the Green Award by AZA in part due to the implementation of the District Energy System. The DES is a site wide low grade energy loop that extracts or rejects energy through a variety of sources. Heat producing equipment such as chillers and food service refrigeration reject heat in to the loop through liquid cooled condensers. Isolated water and glycol systems are circulated using variable speed pumps to move energy around the system. Heat is extracted through heat exchangers to warm habitats, galleries and coils in local HVAC air handlers. Cooling is accomplished in the same way using the cold side of the system. Temperatures in the loop are maintained in a specified range using seawater heat exchangers, boilers, heat pumps and a cooling tower. Planning is underway to install a geothermal field to store excess heat produced in warmer months for use in the winter. The net effect is that heating and cooling costs can be reduced since it requires much less energy to redistribute the energy than it would to produce it at multiple points of use.\nLife support system instrumentation indicates equipment function, but it is water quality parameters that indicate equipment efficacy and resource allocation that indicates equipment efficiency. Equipment parameters\u2014pressure, flow, water level, etc.\u2014can be operating within \u201cdesign specifications\u201d, yet water quality parameters (e.g., nutrients, alkalinity, pH) can be unsuitable for aquatic life and/or excess resources (e.g., water, energy, labor) must be expended to normalize the environment. In the past, available technologies were not able to address the demands of a healthy closed aquarium habitat without eventual recourse to substantial water exchanges to normalize the environment. This situation no longer prevails. Dissolved contaminants can now be physically removed from solution by ozone-assisted foam fractionation, a widely accepted industry standard in the modern era. Nitrite accumulation can be managed with recently-developed and user-friendly denitrification technologies. Phosphates can be controlled with modern water treatment tools and pH decline can be addressed via well-designed gas exchangers to ameliorate CO2 accumulation from animal and bacterial respiration, and the degradation of wastes and uneaten food. Given these relatively recent advances, it is clear that water quality challenges in a modern aquarium have their root causes tied to incomplete life support system design and/or inappropriate system operation. By ensuring that life support systems are well designed and operated appropriately, optimal water quality can result and excess resource expenditure can be avoided, consistent with the conservation and fiscal priorities for the modern zoo and aquarium.\nPressured by the rapid pace of climate change and ocean acidification, aquariums are feeling an increased urgency to provide a message of conservation and sustainability to their visitors. Research shows that people are more receptive to this message when presented with concrete evidence of how their actions can create positive change. As such, aquariums have a stronger incentive than ever to lead by example, reducing their demands for energy and freshwater. Traditional aquarium life support systems have been very energy and freshwater use intensive, primarily due to pump energy, heating and cooling demands and use of water for backwashing of filters. Such systems can easily account for more than 50% of the energy and water use of a facility. But opportunities to reduce energy and water use with such systems are minimal without unacceptable reductions in water quality. However, innovative system design alternatives are being included in new aquariums and renovations. These incorporate drum filtration, which can drastically reduce energy and water use over traditional pressurized filtration systems. Additional strategies, such as integration of life support heating and cooling into energy efficient building mechanical systems introduce the potential for further energy reductions. Such systems are most effective when system elements are arranged so that gravity flow replaces a significant amount of pumping. While capital costs of such systems may be somewhat higher than traditional systems, life cycle cost analysis can be used to demonstrate that substantial energy and water savings and reduced equipment maintenance and replacement costs can easily offset the initial cost premium of such a system. By pushing the design of our future facilities, aquariums can lead by example as they strive to increase the impact of conservation education on their visitors.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T17:14:19Z", "url": "https://www.animalprofessional.com/iac-2016-life-support-operations-abstracts.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The brand identity of an airline carrier is critical to its survival. Consumer belief in a carrier can be fragile and mishaps involving customer service or safety concerns have been known to swiftly tarnish years of goodwill and trust. Though businesses in any industry must be careful with their image, perceptions regarding air travel heavily influence the graphic and web design trends in aviation. Airline carriers their customers to see them as modern, forward moving, and focused on safety and comfort. This objective drove the recent rebranding of several airlines. Even airlines seeking to stand out, do so in similar ways. In this blog, we\u2019ll pinpoint a few examples and summarize the latest trends.\nYou\u2019ve seen it. In recent years many airlines redesigned their logos with bold, sleek typefaces and simple logos as part of their rebranding efforts. They chose elements to speak directly to the consumer. Think about it\u2013nobody wants to ride in a plane from the 1950\u2019s. Bold, sleek letters say, \u201cWe\u2019re modern, and we get you to your destination with modern comforts.\u201d Two of the industry leaders, United and Delta, recently adopted bold, all-caps typefaces to reflect the strength and power of their fleet. Airline carriers around the world are rolling out more simplistic logos. Too many details can over complicate a message, and hearken back to the days where companies carried plaques garnished with every facet of their identity. It is much more practical to drop the busy details and buff the important elements. Not only does this freshen up the look and feel of a brand, but it is much cheaper to paint an airplane using simpler shapes and a smaller color pallet. In fact, the latest trend for aircraft signage design, also known as livery design, includes simplification of a basic visual element of the brand. Paint adds weight to a plane and drives up fuel expenses. Therefore, most airlines fly predominately white planes. The wordmark of the logo is usually placed on the fuselage near the nose of the plane, seated above the windows. This is one of the best positions for visual balance without having to address distortion caused by windows. To compensate for lack of variance from competitors, the tails of the planes are increasingly decorative and colorful. Pops of bright colors often adorn wing tips or plane engines. The decorative airplane tails have in turn influenced another trend. Many logos have evolved to take the shape of airplane tails, including those of Quantas, Iberia, and Swiss International Air Lines. This decision allows for easy translation to the plane\u2019s overall signage design. Unfortunately, competitors can easily replicate this design choice, resulting in some brands straying away from this trend to remain distinct. The similarity of font, logo, and livery design treatments drives many airlines to embrace more creative elements to garner attention. One trend involves using bright, attractive pops of color. Spirit\u2019s boisterous yellow, Latam\u2019s energetic violet, and Southwest\u2019s flashy striping all say the same thing: \u201cPlease look at me, not the guys in blue and red. We\u2019re different. We\u2019re better.\u201d This is often paired with a marketing angle such as a more enjoyable experience, cheaper prices, or shared culture. Another shift among the smaller, regional, trend-setting carriers is to express their playful differences by adding rounded corners to their wordmark, or using more stylistic fonts that carry a more contemporary feel.\nAlmost every airline website opens the same way: a few menu options along the top, a high-resolution photograph of a travel destination, and a form inside the image. The form usually has tabbed options that include booking a flight, checking-in, or checking a flight status. Sometimes these elements appear with statements in large font promoting current offers or discounts. Presenting the user with one to three immediate options acknowledges airline customers\u2019 priorities, and provides the fastest path to common customer goals. A strong trend in web design is constructing responsive, mobile-first layouts. The big players in aviation seem to buck this trend in favor of creating separate mobile sites that completely restructure the user\u2019s experience. Of course, airlines keep consistent branding across these platforms, but they drop a large portion of the content shown on the desktop site to streamline the mobile version. These mobile pages cater exclusively to check-ins, status updates, viewing frequent flier mileage, etc. Some airlines even encourage the user to ditch the web browser and download their custom app. Another notable airline web design trend is a return to modular design. Modular web design uses card-like elements that function to organize information into digestible chunks. Airlines create focal points by highlighting elements with different colored backgrounds, larger fonts, and distinctive shapes. Modular web design enjoyed a rebirth following the release of the \u201cmaterial design\u201d standards from Google. Google defines material design as a \u201cvisual language for users that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science.\u201d While many airlines have not adopted the material design standards in full, many of the over-arching themes are apparent: bold colors, flat web elements, and the re-emergence of tasteful, realistic drop shadows.\nSpirit recently unveiled a hand-drawn logo with \u201csketchy\u201d design elements that speak to the company\u2019s low fare, no frills air travel service and its back-to-basics branding. Although executed nicely, \u201csketchy\u201d is not often a word people want to associate with an air carrier. Some consumers expressed disinterest in flying Spirit because of these design choices. Though individuality is important to fold into any brand, it can be risky for an airline to separate themselves too far from the pack. With safety and comfort as a minimum requirement of consumers, along with the need to make air travel as simple and streamlined as much as possible, it could be risky to reinvent the wheel.

{"text": "The anti-alcohol folks are pushing for stronger and mandatory warnings on drinks about the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\nBaddock argues attempts by the alcohol industry to promote measures to reduce FASD have been ineffective and rather seek to debate the evidence.\nThe NZMA submission urges decision-makers to be aware of, and pre-empt, industry counter-arguments to public health measures such as mandatory labelling.\nBaddock says a standard alcohol industry tactic has been to cite lack of evidence as a reason not to do something, which has been used by others such as the tobacco industry to \"thwart and delay\" public health measures like plain packaging.\n\"It's not just alcohol. I think any industry tends to be resistant to anything mandatory that might affect their sales.\"\nHowever, she is hopeful the alcohol industry will \"come on board\" with mandatory pregnancy warnings.\n\"I would love to see the alcohol industry put up their hand and say FASD is a real problem and we need to be helping reduce the harms done [by alcohol].\"\nTraditionally, the status quo has some weight. Those proposing changes to the status quo have to provide some evidence that the change will be beneficial - that the gains will exceed the costs. In areas where evidence on gains and harms is hard to come by, we can look to international evidence - or run trials.\nIt is a bit odd to pre-emptively say (my paraphrase): \"Hey, we don't have any evidence that our policy proposal will do any good. We ran some focus groups suggesting that people don't pay much notice to current labels, but we have no particularly good reason to expect that mandatory labeling will change real-world behaviour in the cohort we should be worried about. But anybody pointing out the absence of evidence - we're going to pre-emptively say that they're industry shills.\"\nAnother fun bit - the anti-alcohol people worry that messages like 'it's safest not to drink while pregnant' might strengthen beliefs that light drinking in pregnancy is harmless.\nHere's Emily Oster on that. She included a nice section on alcohol in her review of all of the evidence on the dos and don'ts during pregnancy.\nThere exists no large (or even small) randomized trial about drinking during pregnancy; such a thing is never likely to exist. This is not unique to drinking, of course \u2013 there are no large randomized trials of Tylenol usage in pregnancy, either, just a lot of large observational studies. And some women will read the existing evidence and still choose to abstain. But there is a growing body of data suggesting that, if women choose to have a glass of wine, there is no evidence they are harming their baby.\nTelling women that an occasional glass of wine is more harmful to their baby than heroin or cocaine is misleading and may also be potentially dangerous. It surely would not be supported by the vast majority of the medical establishment. Focusing on punishing and shaming women who choose to have an occasional glass of wine during their pregnancy also takes away important focus from helping women who are struggling with truly problematic drinking and the social problems that often come with it.\nSo they're worried that people might draw the correct conclusion from the labeling - that heavy drinking during pregnancy is a very very bad idea, but a glass of wine every other day is going to be fine.\nAgain - the anti-alcohol people will not be happy until they have incrementally gotten us to alcohol plain packaging. It's salami-slice tactics, exactly the same as used in the push against tobacco, incrementally piling on restrictions until the only thing allowed on the packaging is warning labels and small-print indication of the manufacturer.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T22:01:58Z", "url": "https://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.com/2018/07/interesting-take-on-evidence-based.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Calisthenics based functional fitness studio, MultiFit offers strength based training with the correct form of gym workout. The startup venture has plans to spread presence in the Indian market.\nThe Indian fitness industry is going through a massive change. As the average Indian is travelling the world, they\u2019ve turned more conscious of newer ways and approaches to remain in shape and bringing new business ideas to the Indian market. In the past 5 years, the fitness levels of Indians has lifted massively and still the experts consider it as the tip of the iceberg, which means, the avenue of opportunities is tremendous.\nRealising the same, 4 times Everest base camp trekked, an advance level diver- Samir Kapoor has turned his passion for fitness into a new health revolution- MultiFit.\nBased on the firm belief that fitness should extend beyond dumbbells and machines, MultiFit is one of the few gyms in the country that focus on functional training. It challenges the conventional gym imagery by abandoning traditional equipment and narrow goals, instead using simple tools like ropes and tires improve one's performance at everyday activities. The brand was established by Samir Kapoor as a way to bring a fresh perspective to health.\nShare the business DNA of MultiFit. What is its USP?\n\u2018The Soul of our gym is in our trainers\u2019. We are a calisthenics based functional fitness studio and focus more on strength based training with the correct form. We believe in Continuous Varied Intensive Training. We understand one needs to balance in Bodybuilding. We focus not only on weights but also on a good cardiovascular endurance along with flexibility agility, power and strength. Most managers at MultiFit have been certified by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) giving them enough knowledge to shed light on the importance of functional fitness and the best way to practice fitness thus resulting into staying fit.\nWhat is the current scenario of fitness industry and among the top fitness brand, where do you position MultiFit and why?\nMultiFit as a brand focuses on movement rather than exercise. Our philosophy is a fine blend of traditional values and the modern, showcasing fitness in the most interesting way possible. We want to familiarise the audience with the new techniques of fitness which can be followed in daily movements of the body. We are India\u2019s first Calisthenics based gym \u2013 Calisthenics are body weight exercises consisting of gross motor movements that help in improving one\u2019s balance, agility, co-ordination and strength. We definitely are on the right path providing scientific knowledge to our patrons about every exercise which they do so understanding of the fitness art becomes easier.\nDefine the growing competition in Indian fitness industry as per your experience of a relatively new player and how did you strategize to overcome this growing competition.\nSometimes being small and nimble in an evolving or rather sunrise industry is a blessing in disguise. Being new we are not basking in past glory neither do we believe we know it all. We believe that fitness industry needs some new players to come in and take the game to the next level. We take training very seriously along with breaking the stereotype of a conventional gym and adding a fun element in every workout which is taken.\nWhat are your views on the Indian fitness industry? Is it still challenging to convince or motivate Indian consumers to hit the gym? If yes, how do you overcome challenges pertaining to consumer behaviour?\nIndia, as a country has developed in terms of thinking and adopting new values yet staying true to its tradition. Hence, when it comes to gyming, Indians don\u2019t mind ditching the old fashioned machines and giving a rest to monotonous workouts. An aware Indian knows that traditional gyms don\u2019t work, unless you make it interesting and challenging. This is what keeps the patrons engaged and motivated to take out time from their busy schedules and hit the gym. Another addition to motivating people is Athletics based training which is another type of training that gets people addicted to working out.\nWhat are the biggest opportunities existing in Indian Fitness Industry? How is it a beneficial area of investment for start-ups or aspiring entrepreneurs?\nWith very few organized players in the space it\u2019s a big opportunity for startups who have the right vision and the right team. This industry is growing at a neck break speed and is slated to grow 25 fold in the next 5 years. According to a joint study by FICCI and PWC, the Indian wellness industry will touch Rs 1 trillion in 2016. With EBITDA numbers north of 50 per cent it\u2019s the right space for players with passion and dedication to make a change.\nDo you franchise? If No, why? Also, if you do, please share the terms and eligibility to select a franchisee.\nWe have a very unique franchise model. The franchise is only the finance partner. The Gym is run by MultiFit this includes hiring, training and Sales. Also one of the key criteria we look at is the entrepreneurs interest in training. Every single employee has to work with us for at least a month before he is shifted to a franchise. So we ensure that the DNA of the gym stays the same.\nSuggest tips for the entrepreneurs who are taking or willing to take franchise of MultiFit.\nOne needs to remember \u201cThe Soul of Our Gym is in our trainers\u201d. People are your assets and you need to work with them to make them successful. If people out there are passionate enough in contributing to the fitness industry, next stop \u2013 MultiFit. We believe we will be changing the face of fitness.\nIs it a boot strapped venture or you raised funds from the market?\nThis is a 100 per cent self-funded venture.\nWhat\u2019s the current geographical presence of MultiFit? Why not entered in northern region as yet? Or if you did, why not expanding aggressively?\nWe want to reach out to places where there is a dearth of fitness. We want to provide fitness where it is absolutely needed.\nAt the moment, we already have 2 Centres in North India Jaipur and Gurgaon and we are planning more in the near future.\nWhat are your expansion plans? Any new outlet to open in near future? Which potential area in Indian market is still untouched and why?\nWe plan to have 30 branches by Dec 2017. Karadi (Pune) and Gurgaon are two clubs going live in the next fortnight. The new markets in India being Bangalore, Indore, Mumbai and two tier II cities.\nIndia as a country is a completely untapped market. 99 per cent of the country is Untapped. Currently 60per cent of India\u2019s population is under 30 years of age and it\u2019s growing steadily at 8per cent p.a. Out of 80 million middle class households, 55 million (69 per cent) reside in tier II and tier III cities which accounts for 70per cent of total consumption in India. This is the Real India with new dreams, aspirations, wants, and needs. The future of health and fitness is immense and will be driven by this emerging new India.\nDo you feel rapidly growing fitness aggregators of FitTech are big threats to entrepreneurs like you who are most dominating the market through physical presence?\nNot at all, I think they are only creating more awareness of the Industry and will only be helping players like ours. Physical gyms will always stay, we are talking physical activity, it\u2019s like saying one can learn swimming online. Not happening. People may workout on their own, but man is a social animal, working out with people keeps one motivated and it\u2019s the sheer energy which becomes an addiction. We have live cricket on various channels, but year on year the number of people going to the stadium has only increased because of the electrifying environment, fitness is no different.\nInternational Fitness Trends Of 2018..\nWhy It\u2019s Important to Train Staff..\nKey to Winning Consumer Confidence..\nMajor Challenges Of Online Education..\nBest Business Opportunities in Hyderabad..\nFranchising: A Perfect Post Sabbatical Option..\nWhy F&B is a Recession Free Industry..\nChanging the Food Refrigeration Biz in India..\nSalons Moving Ahead with Consumer Trends..\nThis Start-up Has Changed the Fresh Juice Biz..\nKey Highlights of the Interim Budget 2019..\nTransforming Sportswear Into 'Sports Fashion'..", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T14:07:58Z", "url": "https://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness/How-this-startup-is-transforming-gym-business-from-machine-to-strength-training.8827", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "In 1972, snow storm covered the Andes Mountains, the small plane of 40-seat was flying through it. The destination was in Chile, but the weather was not so bad even when the plane touched the sky from Uruguay. After that, the jet jumped heavily in the air, when it was calm to hit the hill and hit it in the other side, many of the 40 people had died in the death country and the rest of them were busy playing the last game with sure death. One of them was Petro Alguta. The crowd of dead bodies lay down all around. There are many human bodies in the same way that they are covered in rice. They did not even die, have survived. But nobody knows how long it can be possible to survive in the cold. Petro's the same condition. The next passenger was dead soon. Petro has gone out of the broken door by removing the dead bodies, along with a few others.\nIn the question what would happen, a passenger suddenly lit torch of light, He said, \"Do not worry, the news of the crash of the plane has reached Chile, from where the rescue team came. After several days have passed, no one is seen. Meanwhile, a few more people have died in the blaze. Then a few young people survived but then he fought with death, but again, how did this situation go away? Meanwhile, the coolness of the cold is rising, the cutting of the wind is blowing like a carrot but no one has left the cold, no one will survive, but death is sure. Meanwhile, the man's food and the last tension of the water quickly burnt down in the face. No one can survive the end of the meal. Without food, it is impossible to survive in this cold if there is no magic. Meanwhile, Petro looked at a glimpse of the clock and 13 days had passed but no one else was seen.\nThey are forgetting the rest of the world, so no one is coming to save them. Then everyone decides to live if they have to eat and if there is no food then dead friends are the only hope. The first was vomited, most of the people then started eating meat of man like a madman, and then they started eating meat. Petro's fate was a friend's cut hand and thighs. Petro was biting his bite. On the day that the people became angry they became a monster. About 25 years after that terrible experience, Petro wrote a book named in to the Mountain. He gave a detailed account of that time. He wrote today and when I look at that day, if I did not do that work then maybe I could not see today's day.\nThink of what a terrible experience is that a group of civilized man eats their Fellow traveler to save lives. In fact, the people who were killed were not forced to eat meat in the day that they were killed, but see that many people are alive today because of the dead people. Petro Alguata is one of them. Petro said from her own experience that on the day nobody was thinking that they were eating meat but everyone thought that friends had saved them even after. Thus, after a whole 72 days, finally a rescue team comes; they come alive to 16 people. These 16 people, who were living under that mountain, ice, and humankind, were the miracles. All of the dead did not die in the crash; many were killed due to severe cold and lack of food. It is also said that there are murders in order to survive because all the people suspected that due to food, there was a condition in the absence of food that anyone could wait for the dead body. When there is a high level of food, it is also common to kill any living person and it has happened to food. Based on this incident, in 1993, a movie, named Alive, was built.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T00:35:46Z", "url": "https://www.worldetalk.com/2018/07/survivor-story-of-andes-plane-crash.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

These leaders recognized the need for a unified voice in natural resource conservation and worked tirelessly to ensure that conservation remained at the forefront of United States agricultural and environmental policy.\nNACD is delighted to announce that its newly launched Hall of Distinction will recognize and honor past and present district official leaders who have helped pave the way for NACD's accomplishments. Your state or territory can induct a former or current district official to the Hall of Distinction every four years. Head to NACD\u2019s website to access the online form used to make inductions, and keep an eye out for new inductees featured in eResource.\nEach fall, the Indiana Conservation Partnership (ICP) \u2013 a coalition of eight Indiana agencies including the Indiana Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts (IASWCD) \u2013 sponsors four District Showcase Awards throughout the state. The showcases allow Indiana\u2019s conservation districts the chance to share best practices for conservation project design and implementation.\nThis year\u2019s four conservation district honorees were: the Huntington County Soil and Water Conservation District Group (including Wabash County SWCD, Wells County SWCD, Blackford County SWCD, and Grant County SWCD), the Jennings County SWCD, the Washington County SWCD, and the Hamilton County SWCD.\nLast week, the Hamilton County SWCD\u2019s Urban Conservationist Claire Lane wrapped up the last of the four showcases with a detailed presentation on her district\u2019s activities and a tour of several conservation projects. Pictured are tour attendees \u2013 including NACD North Central Representative Beth Mason \u2013 visiting the Carmel Clay Schools Plots to Plates Organic Gardens in Carmel, Indiana.

NACD President Lee McDaniel and Western Issues Specialist Jeff Burwell spoke at the event, as did Les Owen, director of conservation services for Colorado\u2019s Department of Agriculture, and Clint Evans, Colorado\u2019s NRCS state conservationist.\nThe meeting featured six unique breakout sessions that covered topics like water usage and oversight, forestry stewardship tools, and district funding. Several Colorado conservation districts presented policy proposals related to water resources that will be submitted to NACD through the resolutions process. CACD also presented their 2016 Conservationist of the Year awards to farmers, ranchers, and state legislators.\nUSDA recently opened a new enrollment period for the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). The federal program provides financial assistance to farmers for expanding and maintaining conservation practices on working lands. Eligible practices include cover cropping, creating pollinator habitat, reducing pesticide drift, and converting to organic production.\nIf farmers and ranchers are interested in enrolling in CSP they have until February 3, 2017 to submit their initial application. Although NRCS accepts applications year-round, submissions after this date will not be considered until 2018. CSP is a highly competitive program. At the end of each enrollment period, applications are ranked and the highest scoring applications are funded.\nLast week, a meeting unlike any other was convened in Atlanta, Georgia. The Sustainable Agriculture Summit \u2013 hosted by Field to Market, the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy, the National Pork Board, the Stewardship Index for Specialty Crops, the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association, and the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Beef \u2013 featured presentations from industry experts on all aspects of supply chain sustainability.\nNACD Communications Specialist Bill Berry represented conservation in a panel discussion featuring NRCS leaders and Field to Market staff.

{"text": "As of March 12, 2018, we will no longer be updating or maintaining the WannaCrypt Patch (MS17-10) collection. Even though we\u2019ve removed the collection from the Collection Library, there are still ways to identify and keep computers patched.\nIt\u2019s been nearly a year since the mass hysteria after WannaCrypt and its nasty host of friends hit newsstands. If you need a refresher, we previously posted about this vulnerability here.\nFirst, maintaining the collections each month takes up valuable resources and time. These would be better put to use making PDQ Deploy and PDQ Inventory even more powerful than they already are\u2014not that we\u2019re biased or anything.\nSecond, you are already patched for the WannaCrypt vulnerability if you\u2019ve been regularly applying Microsoft Windows Updates to your machines. Microsoft released the patches for the MS17-10 vulnerability a year ago in March of 2017, with a few exceptions (looking at you, Windows XP). For more information, refer to Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010 \u2013 Critical.\nMany of you have been using the WannaCrypt Patch (MS17-10) collection to determine whether any machines on your network are vulnerable. If you currently have any collections, schedules, reports, or other references pointing to the WannaCrypt collection, you will need to update those to prevent incorrect or accidental deployments. I\u2019m going to walk you through an easy way to stay current.\nThe Windows Updates collections in the PDQ Inventory Collection Library identify which computers do not have the most current cumulative update or monthly rollup. Remember, the most recent Windows Updates include the WannaCrypt patches, as well as the patches to mitigate other vulnerabilities.\nWe recommend using these collections along with PDQ Deploy to automate Windows patch management. Our products are designed to work together to automatically deploy updates to the computers that need it; a true set-it-and-forget-it.\nIf this is the first time you\u2019re hearing about Auto Download packages, take a look at all of our Auto Download videos.\nWe recommend downloading two Windows Update packages from the Package Library; one for testing and another for production. This allows you to deploy the most current Windows updates to a pilot group of computers (perhaps belonging to your IT colleagues) to ensure that the update doesn\u2019t break any of your end-users\u2019 critical applications.\nOpen the package and add to the name for identification purposes (optional).\nChange the approval setting to Immediate (Package Properties > Options tab).\nThe second Windows update package will be for the rest of your environment.\nUsing a Manual approval setting will allow you sufficient time for testing to ensure the Windows Updates don\u2019t make it out to any end-users until after testing is complete. However, if you know the amount of time the testing will take, you can select a set number of days with the Automatic approval setting.\nDownload a second Windows update package.\n(Optional) Add identification to the package name.\nNow that you have two identical packages with different approval settings, you just need to set up a schedule. The schedule won\u2019t deploy the new versions of packages until after approval.\nHere is a video that walks you through establishing a schedule.\nTo ensure these packages deploy to computers that need the update, you can link to the PDQ Inventory Windows Update collections we discussed earlier.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the schedules, the test package will be approved immediately after the update is released and deployed. You can then approve the production package for mass deployment to the rest of the organization once you are reassured no critical applications are affected.\nWith this setup, the newest version of the Windows Update packages will auto download each month, and the scheduled deployment will only go out to the computers missing the update as defined in PDQ Inventory.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T13:14:10Z", "url": "https://www.pdq.com/blog/wannacrypt-collection/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "3rd March 2015 - A new UN report on the global drug situation has highlighted the widening rift between countries on the issue of the death penalty for drug offences. These tensions are set to surface as Member States convene in Vienna next week at the annual meeting of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the UN policy making body on drug control issues.\nThe Annual Report of the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), released today, calls upon States that \u2018continue to impose the death penalty for drug-related offences to consider abolishing the death penalty for such offences\u2019.\nThe statement comes just a week before the annual meeting of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the UN policy making body on drug control issues, and underscores an issue that has become increasingly volatile among members of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in recent years. Indeed, attempts to craft a joint resolution on drugs at last year\u2019s meeting nearly fell apart amidst heated debates between Member States on including language against the death penalty.\nThe death penalty for drugs looks to again be a major point of contention at the 2015 Commission meeting next week. A recent spate of executions in Indonesia has turned the world\u2019s attention to the practice, with the killings of Dutch and Brazilian nationals prompting those governments to recall their Ambassadors from Jakarta. It remains to be seen how these diplomatic tensions will influence the States\u2019 relations during the Commission meeting.\nBut it is not just Indonesia\u2019s actions that are bringing these tensions to the fore. A number of other countries have demonstrated a renewed enthusiasm for executing drug offenders over the past year: Iran has escalated drug related hangings, Pakistan has resumed executions and Oman has proposed to introduce capital punishment for drug crimes. A protest to end the use of the death penalty for drugs will take place outside UN headquarters in Vienna during the Commission meeting.\nThe statement from the INCB -- a body of independent experts that monitors the implementation of the international drug control treaties -- reinforces a similar call the group made one year ago, which added its voice to those of other UN authorities, including the Secretary-General, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), who have called for ending the death penalty for drug offences.\nIronically, although the UNODC has publicly spoken out against the death penalty for drug offences, the agency has been linked to funding aggressive anti-trafficking operations in several death penalty States, and a number of donor governments have publicly acknowledged the link between UNODC counter-narcotics funding and death sentences. In recent years the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland all resolved to end funding UNODC programmes in certain countries while the death penalty is still enforced.\n\u201cThe death penalty for drug offences represents the sharp end of the world\u2019s failed war on drugs, disproportionately punishing the vulnerable while failing to tackle entrenched forces of crime and corruption. We welcome the growing number of UN bodies willing to condemn this unjust and ineffective punishment, but these positive sentiments must be backed by effective action if we are to stem the rising tide of states seeking to put drug offenders to death.\nA side event organised during the Commission meeting by the NGOs Reprieve, Harm Reduction International and the International Drug Policy Consortium will specifically examine links between international and UN aid and death sentences and executions for drug offences.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T00:32:20Z", "url": "https://www.hri.global/contents/1531", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Why Many Businesses Choose to Incorporate in Nevada.\nNevada is a very attractive option for businesses choosing to incorporate. Here are a list of the top reasons to consider it even if your business is not based in Nevada.\nNevada Protects the Corporate Veil.\nNevada offers it\u2019s corporations great protection for its board of directors, even if you are the only member on the board and own all of the shares. In the last 24 years the Nevada courts have only allowed the corporate veil to be pierced twice, and both were for outright fraud cases. In comparison, one out of very two cases in California.\nNevada does not exchange information with the IRS.\nThe only other state to do this is Texas. Keep in mind that if you must register your corporation in another state, the state laws there will apply.\nCurrently the filing fees with Nevada are $125.\nNevada offers protection of Board of Directors from shareholder lawsuits.\nThe shareholders must prove gross negligence in order to find the Board of Directors liable. And to prove gross negligence is to pierce the corporate veil in Nevada.\nIn Nevada, you must only have a legal purpose to form a corporation or LLC.\nMeaning, a person could form a Nevada LLC to hold personal assets. It is not required that the LLC have a business purpose to form.\nThere is no joint and several liabilities.\nThis means that if a judgment is entered against several defendants, they will each assume equal liability for the full amount of the judgment, regardless of their relative fault in causing the problem. In Nevada, courts are required to assign a percentage of faults to each defendant. And each defendant is only liable for their percentage.\nOne person can hold all of the corporate positions.\nNevada Protects the Board of Directors and Officers.\nIn 1987, Nevada passed a law permitting corporations to place their own provisions in their Articles of Incorporation that can eliminate the personal liablity of the officers and directors to the stockholders. Furthermore, this provision is automatic in Nevada.\nMembers are not required to be listed in state records.\nStockholders, directors, and officers are not required to be US citizens or live or hold meetings in Nevada.\nNext post: Why Incorporate Your Business.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T16:48:05Z", "url": "https://survivalguideforsmallbusiness.com/2010/03/why-many-businesses-choose-to-incorporate-in-nevada/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Everyone likes to be liked. This is a simple, human truth: As mammals, we are driven by a desire to bond with others, feel accepted, and be acknowledged for a job well done. In fact, research from the University of Iowa shows that feeling accepted is more motivating than even financial incentives and improves our productivity and performance. But there\u2019s a difference between wanting and needing others\u2019 approval.\nIf, for example, you find yourself obsessing over the number of \u201clikes\u201d you get on social media or forever waiting for your supervisor or coworkers to notice that you\u2019ve done something well, you might be caught in a toxic cycle of approval addiction.\nApproval addiction is a constant need for acceptance and approval that drives your daily actions to the detriment of your own needs, says Lynn Taylor, author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior & Thrive in Your Job.\nApproval addicts usually wind up worn out and disappointed, adds psychologist Linda Sapadin, author of Master Your Fears: How to Triumph Over Your Worries and Get On With Your Life. They spend so much energy seeking positive feedback that they have less energy to take care of themselves or work toward their meaningful goals. And, Taylor says, constantly seeking approval can cause people to become workaholics, suffer health problems, and make choices that result in less-than-ideal consequences.\nThe first step is to build awareness and adjust your priorities accordingly. To begin, ask yourself some tough questions. What are your primary goals? What do you want to do? Then evaluate how you spend your time: Are you neglecting your dreams by doing too much for others? With this awareness, you can deliberately choose activities that support your own needs, Taylor says, and step out of the people-pleasing cycle.\nUse the insights gleaned from your personal audit to establish some ground rules and boundaries for yourself. Spend more time on the things that leave you feeling positive and focused on your dreams, needs, and values.

{"text": "\u201cSo, did the cleaning lady come?\u201d I asked him.\nA cleaning lady refused to clean my house! (So, it is true. You really do have to clean your house before the cleaning lady arrives.) I would have happily paid her $100 for four hours worth of work, but she rejected me and my money. Furthermore, she cost herself a customer because I will never again call her and offer her work.\nI am mortified and mystified that my kitchen and bathroom were deemed too big of a job for one person to handle in four hours.\nThat\u2019s nutty! I could clean my whole house in four hours if I really put my mind to it\u2013BY MYSELF! Sheesh\u2026sounds like you found a cleaning lady that\u2019s SPOILED!\nI wonder what her house looks like \u2013 my aunt was a cleaning lady, and although her clients\u2019 homes were spotless, hers has always been in a bit of chaos.\nMost of the cleaning people around here require this same \u201cfirst time\u201d fee. Our house was, quite literally, brand new when we hired a cleaning lady. It had been built just two weeks before we moved in. Still, nearly everyone we interviewed also wanted a first clean fee\u2026.If you have the time to look around, you can probably find someone who won\u2019t charge it. We eventually did, though ours really, geuinely didn\u2019t require it.\nyou are too funny! and while i realize that children totally send our lives into disarray, i also know you\u2026neat as a pin.\ni am so sure she couldn\u2019t clean your kitchen and bathroom! ridiculous lady!\nI just hired a cleaning lady and your story was my worst fear. So, before she came by to give us an estimate, I felt like I had to CLEAN my house for the cleaning lady. How warped is that?\nOurs did charge us about $30 more for the first visit, where they do a deep clean. I can understand that though as things like my windows and blinds have rarely been cleaned and I won\u2019t even go into my lighting fixtures. When you don\u2019t have a maid there are just things you don\u2019t find time to do (at least I don\u2019t).\nIt sounds like this maid might have been a little high-maintenance though. Maybe you can find another who isn\u2019t so picky. When I walked around with my new one and told her I\u2019d make sure the kids toys were picked up, she kind of chuckled like she was thinking that\u2019s not necessary\u2026so who knows what they expect really!\nI\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. And no way would I ever consider seeing how much it would be to clean MY house! Yikes!\nwow\u2026 that is super lame!\nRemind me never to hire a cleaning lady!\nI clean houses for a living. I do not charge extra the first time I go. It is easier and I get it done faster if people just pick up any clutter that may be around. Since I don\u2019t live there, i would not know where it goes to put it away. That is the only thing I like people to do before I clean, otherwise they are doing my job, and what is the point? I usually clean 2 bathrooms, kitchen, family room, dining room, bedrooms in three or four hours. Three hours, I charge 50.00, 4 hours is 70.00. I do extra stuff all the time, like windows, blinds, I have cleaned basements, moved furniture, power washed outside patios, you name it. LOL I have loyal customers, and I am good to them back.\nPeople are LAZY. They want something for nothing. I used to clean houses for a living. I enjoyed it most of the time. $100 for cleaning a kitchen, dining room and what did you say, a bathroom? I can\u2019t remember. I could have cleaned your whole home for $100 and four hours, give or take a few minutes. People really are lazy I tell you.\nAnd whoever said that her aunt cleaned houses and hers was a wreck \u2013 I knew a girl like that. She was a sloppy cleaner too. I on the other hand had a neat and tidy home until I had baby number 3. And it goes downhill from there on many a day now.\nOMG! I could get my daughter to clean it for less.\nI hate cleaning ladies. There is no end to the trouble they have caused me. Go Mel! Good job for cleaning your own stuff.\negads! One would have thought she could have at least TRIED!\nI\u2019m hoping Karen (above) lives in Oklahoma City. I could use her!\nI want someone to pick up the clutter.\nThat doesn\u2019t take much time at all.\nOh, why do I love clutter so much?\nThat seems like a mighty high hourly rate for a cleaning lady. Mine charges $13/hour. Two of them come and clean my large house with 4 bathrooms in 2 1/2 hours. $65 for clean house. Best investment ever made.\nI\u2019m with Judy\u2026I love clutter too much, too, tho it drives me crazy. I once was a cleaning lady, when my kids were little and in school. I cleaned the houses of several people in my church whenever I was needed\u2026part-time and not every week, but the extra $50 came in handy when it was time to buy shoes for the kids or whatever. Boy, even without \u2018snooping\u2019, it\u2019s amazing what you learn about other people\u2019s lives. But one thing I was was discreet and I never talked about anything I saw or learned in anyone\u2019s home. People trusted me, and word-of-mouth kept me busy. I cleaned houses without a speck of dust in them\u2026I cleaned absolute MESSES! All in a day\u2019s work. Back then, we ladies charged $10 per hour\u2026I can\u2019t imagine what the going rate is now.\nA cleaning lady who wouldn\u2019t clean? she\u2019s in the wrong business! I have a great cleaning lady, she comes every 3 weeks. She\u2019s reasonable, she\u2019s good and trustworthy. The good ones ARE out there.\nI\u2019m Lisa, btw, I found my way over from Kellans.\nKeep looking- not all cleaning ladies are this way. My mom cleans houses and has a very loyal customer base, they actually do what they can just to keep her. She is purely word of mouth and has more people calling than she can keep up with. She will do a first time walk through and discuss what they want done, what she can get done in that time and a set amount and what day works. She requires them to declutter and be out of the house when she comes- people get in the way and slow her down. Most people like this because it helps keep them organized and not fall behind week to week. She is efficient, picky and knows her stuff. She will tell people what kind of cleaning supplies work best, they purchase that kind. She has even been asked to pick out someones new vacuum- she likes that because she\u2019s used so many different ones that she knows which work best and which have no suction\u2026..anyways, hope your search goes better.\nKaren, would you consider relocating to Nebraska? lol My house is a disaster. Between having a chronic illness and a full time job \u2013 my house is a disaster. I feel like I can\u2019t afford a cleaning lady. Besides the clutter in place would choke a horse!\nLOL I have helped pick out one of my customers new vacuums as well. Somebody mentoned nobody would to clean their house because it was an older farm house, yesterday I cleaned a farm house that is close to 100 years old. They have three dogs running around. LOL They are good people and I love cleaning for them. Good cleaning help is hard to find, but we are out there! I have become friends with all of the people I clean for. Also Mel, I cannot imagine walking into somebody\u2019s house and not even attempting to clean it. That is rude, and very unprofessional. She could have at least tried to do as much as she could in that time period. Sorry you had such a bad experience.\nabout Atonement \u2013 haven\u2019t seen the movie, but the book was great!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T23:12:21Z", "url": "https://unretouchedphoto.com/2008/01/13/rejection/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "An example method involves providing, with a network management module of a network management system, current reroute statistics in a data structure based on the rerouting of the data from a logical circuit that has failed to a logical failover circuit in the network. The current reroute statistics include a committed information rate corresponding to the logical circuit in the network. The logical circuit is identified by a first logical circuit identifier. The logical failover circuit is identified by a second logical circuit identifier. The first and second logical circuit identifiers are renamed until the logical circuit has been restored from failure. Updated reroute statistics are provided, with the network management module, based on a change in a status of the logical circuit resulting from the committed information rate having been exceeded.\nThis patent arises from a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 7,460,468, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\nThis patent is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/348,077, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Obtaining Logical Performance Data for a Circuit in a Data Network,\u201d filed Jan. 21, 2003, and U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 10/745,047, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Automatically Renaming Logical Circuit Identifiers For Rerouted Logical Circuits In A Data Network,\u201d filed Dec. 23, 2003, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/745,170, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Automatically Identifying A Logical Circuit Failure In A Data Network,\u201d filed on Dec. 23, 2003, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/744,921, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Automatically Rerouting Logical Circuit Data In A Data Network,\u201d filed Dec. 23, 2003. All of the above-referenced applications are expressly incorporated herein by reference.\nPeriodically, failures may occur to the trunk circuits or the NNIs of network circuits in large-scale networks causing lost data. Currently, such network circuit failures are handled by dispatching technicians on each end of the network circuit (i.e., in each LATA) in response to a reported failure. The technicians manually access a logical element module to troubleshoot the logical circuit portion of the network circuit. The logical element module communicates with the switches in the data network and provides the technician with the status of the logical connections which make up the logical circuit. Once the technician determines the status of a logical connection at one end of a logical circuit (e.g., the host end), the technician then must access a network database to determine the location of the other end of the logical circuit so that its status may also be ascertained. If the technician determines the logical circuit is operating properly, the technician then accesses a physical element module to troubleshoot the physical circuit portion of the network circuit to determine the cause of the failure and then repair it. If, while troubleshooting a network circuit, the technician determines that a network circuit will be \u201cdown\u201d (i.e., losing data) for an extended time period, the technician may manually reroute the data from a failed network circuit to an available unused or \u201cbackup\u201d network circuit while the failed network circuit is being repaired.\nAs discussed briefly above, the network management module 176 may be configured to automatically reroute logical circuit data from a failed logical circuit to a logical failover circuit in the data network 2. During the reroute of logical circuit data, the network management module 176 may also be configured to rename the logical circuit identifier assigned to a failed logical circuit to the logical circuit identifier assigned to a corresponding logical failover circuit until the failed logical circuit has been restored. An illustrative method detailing the renaming of logical circuit identifiers is presented in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/745,047, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Automatically Renaming Logical Circuit Identifiers For Rerouted Logical Circuits In A Data Network,\u201d filed on Dec. 23, 2003, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.\nThe logical operations 500 continue from operation 505 to operation 510 where the network management module 176 generates a table for presenting the current reroute statistics generated at operation 505. It will be appreciated that the table may be presented in an electronic format so that it is graphically displayed on one or more display terminals of the network management module 176. FIG. 6A is a table presenting current reroute statistics which may be generated for rerouted logical circuits in the data network 2, according to an embodiment of the invention. The table will be discussed in greater detail in the description of FIG. 6A below.\nAt operation 525, the network management module 176 generates updated reroute statistics based on the received updated trap data and then updates the table (generated at operation 510) at operation 530. FIG. 6B is a table presenting updated reroute statistics which may be generated for rerouted logical circuits in the data network 2, according to an embodiment of the invention. The table will be discussed in greater detail in the description of FIG. 6B below. The logical operations 500 then continue at operation 535.\nFIG. 6A is a table 190 presenting current reroute statistics which may be generated by the network management module 176 for rerouted logical circuits in the data network 2, according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in FIG. 6A, the table includes a LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52, a REROUTE STATUS column 54, a LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56, a # HOPS column 58, a UTILIZATION column 60, a QUALITY OF SERVICE (QoS) column 62, and a REROUTE PERIOD column 64. The LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52 lists the logical circuit IDs for logical circuits belonging to one or more network circuit customers in the data network 2. The REROUTE STATUS column 54 lists whether or not each of the logical circuits in the LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52 is currently being rerouted. The LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56 lists the logical circuit IDs for logical failover circuits which may be utilized for rerouting data from the logical circuits listed in the LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52. The # HOPS column 58 lists the number of hops taken by data being communicated through the logical failover circuits identified in the LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56. The UTILIZATION column 60 lists the utilization percentage of the logical failover circuits identified in the LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56 by rerouted logical circuit data. The QoS column 62 lists the quality of service offered for rerouted data by each of the logical failover circuits identified in the LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56. The REROUTE PERIOD column 64 lists the amount of time the data from each of the logical circuits identified in the LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52 has been rerouted to the logical failover circuits identified in the LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56.\nproviding, with the network management module, updated reroute statistics based on a change in a status of the logical circuit resulting from the committed information rate having been exceeded.\n2.

He pointed out that Cal Cedar is a relative newcomer to this list which included at least 9 companies in attendance that he was proud to count as customers who had already surpassed the 100 year mark. CalCedar and the Berolzheimer family have now been working with many of these companies as slat supplier for 2, 3 and even 4 generations.

{"text": "Attorneys at Hyatt McIntire and Associates* specialize in estate planning, trust and probate law. We are dedicated to personalized, proactive, effective and resourceful planning that protects clients and their assets during their lifetime and efficiently distributes assets to beneficiaries at death.\nEstate planning is deceptively complex; it is tempting to \u2018do it yourself\u2019. After all, almost everyone knows about a power of attorney and a will. Unfortunately, there are many ways for a plan to go terribly wrong. In some situations, no plan at all is effective. Other times, no plan, or incomplete and faulty planning brings needless financial and emotional hardship to loved ones.\nDo you know the factors in your life that make estate planning, or lack of planning, vulnerable to disaster?\nBelow is a story of heartbreak, financial difficulty or family disruption that could have been avoided with effective planning. The story is real; with changes to protect confidentiality. It\u2019s one of many stories highlighting ways a good plan can go wrong, the perils of not planning at all, the danger in do-it-yourself, and Buyer Beware if you don\u2019t use an estate planning attorney.\nHusband and Wife (\u201cHarry\u201d and \u201cWilma\u201d) had been married for over 30 years. Harry died unexpectedly, in middle of real estate sale. The real estate broker, the buyer, and Wilma were surprised to find out Harry was the only listed owner on the Deed. The real estate agent called our office to help. We were able to scramble, avoid a probate, and get the property in Wilma\u2019s name. In this case, it worked because Harry and Wilma had acquired the property during their marriage and she could swear until penalty of perjury, that the property was community property.\nWilma vowed to develop her own estate plan so that her three children would not have any hassles at her death. She met with me on several occasions and we talked about it a lot. She knew how she wanted her estate divided: one child needed to inherit her home, even though this meant the others would not have an equal share. The other two didn\u2019t \u2018need\u2019 the home and were not in a position to take care of Wilma\u2019s many animals on the property. She worried that the distribution would be unequal because there were insufficient other assets to balance out the gift of the home.\nThe primary worry that kept her from making the plan was how one child would react. We discussed her options and she accepted that it was her decision to make, but she just didn\u2019t want to confront the unresolved issue with a child. She went into the hospital for a little bout of something and never came home. One daughter continued to pay property taxes, keep the home up and care for the animals until her money ran out.\nSince Wilma had never signed her estate plan, she was intestate; the Probate Code determines what happens to a person\u2019s assets when they don\u2019t leave a will. In this case, all three children shared equally in the estate, which meant the house was sold. The relationship among the siblings rapidly deteriorated and will not likely be repaired. It was not what Wilma wanted and her family is paying the price; it is really heartbreaking.\nDo you understand your estate plan? Do you know the factors in your life that make estate planning, or lack of planning, vulnerable to disaster?\nGive the attorneys at Hyatt McIntire & Associates* a call; we are problem solvers and believe the best solution is to be proactive. We can help.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T03:01:45Z", "url": "https://www.hm1law.com/perils-of-not-planning/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "With the emergence of smartwatches, consumers can answer calls, send text messages and get directions, as well as plenty of other tasks without even reaching for their smartphone. The next level of smartwatches now offers the look of a traditional watch combined with the features of a smartwatch, earning the name, hybrid smartwatch. Similar to how e-readers use technology on a classic use of paper, smartwatches try to bridge time, literally.\nUnlike the original smartwatch, hybrid smartwatches showcase an analog clock on the face of the watch, rather than a touchscreen, and use a button on the side of the watch for controls. Hybrid smartwatches are a useful tool for managing your smartphone conveniently. Here are some popular watch brands that have recently came out with hybrid smartwatches that you can try out today.\nFossil\u2019s Q Hybrid Smartwatches come in 18 different designs and allow you to switch out the straps to fit your specific style. The watches offer up to 6 months of battery life (depending on usage), running on a standard watch battery. Your phone and smartwatch stay connected using the Fossil Q App. This makes it the perfect solution for chatterbots who love to keep in touch with friends and family on the go.\nKronaby has a whole line of hybrid smartwatches for you to consider. However, they will cost you quite a bit of cash. The hybrid smartwatches sell for $395-$675, but it is money well spent if you need a great watch. The line features models for both men and women. The watches use only the best watch materials, and feature a changeable wristband. In addition, the watch has step tracking features, notifications, remote music playback controls and remote picture taking capabilities. You can even use the notifications to push your Russell Simmons Yoga app reminders to your watch. You can also use the hybrid smartwatch to let others know your current location with the press of just a single button. If you want a hybrid smartwatch that offers useful safety features, Kronaby may be worth your money.\nSkagen\u2019s design is called the Hagen Connected Hybrid Smartwatch and comes with a variety of straps including, steel-mesh, leather and silicon. This watch also uses an app which allows you to view data and manage your settings. The Hagen watch has a replaceable battery that lasts for four to six months.\nFor men looking for high-end hybrid smartwatches, Movado\u2019s Bold Connected II could be the watch for you. This watch is offered in two different designs, one with a stainless steel link bracelet and the other with a black silicone strap. Both were engineered by HP and feature an analog clock with a small LED screen toward the bottom of the watch face. The Bold Connected II has a rechargeable battery and comes with a charging cable. Of course, it can be bought with a Chase payment too.\nKate Spade offers a gold hybrid smart watch for women it calls the Vachetta and Gold Hybrid Smartwatch. This watch connects to the Kate Spade New York app to track your information and never requires a charge. The company also sells the watch as part of a smartwatch box set. The set comes equipped with two options for the wearer, a two tone gold bracelet or an interchangeable black leather strap.\nMichael Kors\u2019 hybrid smartwatch is marketed as the perfect watch for any jet setter. The watch adjusts to your current time zone automatically when you land somewhere new and allows you keep up with two time zones at once. It is available in three different color combinations, black-tone, gold-tone and silver-tone and leather. This watch\u2019s battery requires no charging and lasts up to 6 months, unlike that certain gadget you have been reading unbrick iPhone guides about.\nAll of these hybrid smartwatch options are water resistant and compatible with your Apple or Android smartphone. Most are also Bluetooth enabled, a step up from 1000base t-devices. Also, they require little to no charging. Being that the hybrid smartwatch comes equipped with the modern technology of a smartwatch and the look and feel of a traditional watch, it is easy for all to use. No matter your style, the perfect hybrid smartwatch is out there for you.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T12:15:24Z", "url": "http://www.thedigitalbridges.com/best-hybrid-smartwatches-tech-features/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "So, you suffer from Hay Fever or Allergic Rhinitis and are trying to decide which air purifier is most likely to help you, well you have come to the right place, we have great first hand experience of Hay fever in this office (unfortunately!) , and think we can definitely help to point you in the right direction, read on for our guide on choosing the best air purifier for relief from Hay Fever.\nWhat is the most important thing to consider?\nWhen it comes to removing tree , grass and shrub pollens the most important ingredient your air purifier must have is a good level of suction. Yup, that's right, the air purifier you choose will almost certainly have a filter capable of trapping those allergens, but if it doesn't have enough suction to actually draw them towards it quickly enough then it will not be of much use.\nHow do you work out how quickly an air purifier will gobble up those offending allergens then?\nThe first thing is to compare the CADR ( Clean Air Delivery Rate ) of the machines you are interested in. Generally speaking a higher CADR rating means quicker removal of the offending allergens in your room.\nIn order to be truly effective in gobbling up pollens an air purifier needs to be powerful enough to recirculate all of the air in YOUR room size through its filter as frequently as possible. As a guide, try to choose a machine which has enough air volume to process all the air in your largest room at least 3 times an hour. If you can get one which provides around 4 or 5 times an hour that would be even better.\nThe CADR rating on a box tells a consumer how efficient an air purifier is at actually removing the three main indoor pollutants, namely Pollen, Smoke and Dust. In this case, as a Hay Fever sufferer you should try to choose one where the pollen figure is highest. Clean Air Delivery Rate testing is carried out by an impartial and independent organisation called AHAM - a word of caution here though - not all manufacturers submit their units for certified testing to AHAM and may instead just list their own 'in house' test results on the box. If you want to be certain of what you are buying always choose a machine which has the genuine 'AHAM Certified' Seal on the box.\nBEWARE of the manufacturers over inflated 'recommended room sizes'.\nThis is where we believe most consumers get misled into spending good money on something which is never going to be powerful enough to provide them with genuine relief from their Hayfever. Manufacturers usually state on the product box and specification list that the air purifier is 'For Rooms up to...' and then quote a room size usually given in square metres (m2). This information is completely worthless unless it is also followed by another figure telling you how long it will take to clean the air in that size of room.\nOne blatant example of this currently available on the High Street is an air purifier range manufactured by VAX which on the face of it seems to be reasonable value for money. One of their units available for \u00a3199 in Argos has a Pollen CADR rating of 240. So we know it is capable of removing pollens and according to the manufacturers specification the unit is suitable for rooms up to 103m2. However, when you calculate the CADR rating and divide it into the claimed room size, it shows that the unit would take 65 minutes to clean the air once in a room that size, equating to a very poor 0.93 air changes an hour. Remember, we already know that an air purifier needs to provide at least 3-5 air changes an hour to be genuinely effective at removing allergens!\nAnother VAX unit at \u00a394.99 claims it will remove over 99% of allergens in rooms up to 87m2. Yet once again taking the CADR figure and working out the results clearly shows that this unit will take 69 minutes to purify the air once in that room size, equating to just 0.8 air changes an hour. These air purifiers may well still be effective in reducing Hay Fever symptoms, but realistically the room sizes in which they will be able to perform well are about 5 times smaller than those quoted.\nOK, enough of the technical stuff!\nTo cut through the numbers and make life a little simpler for us all, we have put together a list of air purifiers which we know will provide up to 5 air changes per hour in their recommended room size, and all of which have genuine AHAM certified CADR ratings.

{"text": "At 72 years old, Robert Palov described himself as a busy man on the go. Juggling time between a marketing job and golf courts, he took good care of his health to maintain his busy lifestyle. But in May 2015, Palov experienced two weeks of chest pains. Following a visit with a cardiologist at the Lakeshore Hospital he knew his lifestyle was about to change.\nThe angiogram was very clear: Palov had extensive blockage in his arteries (85 to 90 per cent) and needed to undergo surgery as soon as possible.\nIt was Dr. Patrick Ergina, cardiac surgeon at the RVH-MUHC, who treated Palov. \u201cMr. Palov came to the MUHC because he needed an Aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass surgery,\u201d he explains.\nDr. Ergina\u2019s mission was to help restore the blood flow to Palov\u2019s heart by replacing the blocked aortic valve with a new prosthetic valve and by bypassing the blocked coronary arteries with vessels that were taken from his legs.\nRaji Cambow was one of Palov\u2019s physiotherapists during his stay at the MUHC.

{"text": "My writing routine begins with a walk outdoors. Not a long walk or a fast one. Two miles up the street and back, early in the morning in summer before our California sun blisters the city, or before rain turns a winter walk into a slog. Most mornings it\u2019s a walk on the shady side of the street, a familiar trek that doesn\u2019t require me to think about where to turn or when to start ambling back home.\nI\u2019m lucky if I can get going without returning for one last thing, like replacing the house phone for my cell, realizing I\u2019m not wearing my contacts, trading stiff shoes for a more comfortable pair, one more trip to bathroom, another smear of sunblock. Once I\u2019m finally on my way, it\u2019s a slight uphill hike and a reverse easy jaunt down.\nA walk is a great opportunity to get a bit of exercise, because I will never wear those dorky rubber band outfits I\u2019d have to don to go to a gym. I work out problems, even if I don\u2019t work up much of a sweat, like the chronic situations that give me nightmares if I sleep in too late. I worry about personal problems, because as much as I\u2019m fortunate to have loving family and friends, there is always someone to worry about. I worry about the injustices of my employment, politically inspired office intrigue affecting even my paltry claim to the working world. The walk uphill gives me a chance to excise those devils, though they\u2019ll return like persistent hiccups. I walk more and more determinedly, relinquishing the pain in my calves for concentration on those cerebral irritants. Most days I realize there is little I can do except let go my worry, anger, and frustration, so I do, resolution of sorts.\nAt the top of the rise my palm swings around the light post that signals my walk homeward, and I begin to write. I work in my head because I can\u2019t walk with a laptop though I\u2019ve considered it. Some of my effort will get lost on the way home, but I\u2019ll retain the essence of my work.\nI hunt when I walk. I am a bird of prey. I seek words and pluck them before they scurry to safety. I stash interesting words that say things other than boring things like thing, (could you be more specific?) or stuff, (could you please be more specific?) or place (oh come on now.) Words come inspired by the crack of brittle tree limb, a flash of sunlight tagging a flag on a house balcony, the blap of a horn as a car zips by. Sensory imprints cast words like paladin (I want one of them for my very own, with sword or without), bleat (the sound of losers whining or of animals trapped in tales about Cyclopic pigs with batwings), contrafactum (just hum along here). I cache words for late night writing snacks.\nThen I\u2019m on to phrases, collections of words strung in movable pieces like frig magnets, passages whizzing around pesky as gnats. Found this one after passing an odorous clump left by someone who owns a dog but \u201cforgot\u201d the blue plastic baggie: \u201ca dapple of sunlight tapping shadows on the ground, the only beauty in this muck.\u201d Technically the dog left it, but you know what I mean. This next phrase is a bit of a cheat as I discovered it after falling into the cul de sac trying to remove a stubbornly rooted weed, minutes after completing my walk: \u201cI see myself as a force of nature but a submissive one.\u201d Maybe this one is usable: \u201cWhy is it that when a thing drops, it always slides under a cabinet so massive and low-grounded that you can\u2019t reach it without a backhoe?\u201d Cheating again, a complete sentence but not a profound one. The idea came after the pretty stone I wanted to keep dropped and rolled under a tangle of weeds, lost forever. How many unidentifiable clumps did I want to turn over?\nFinally it\u2019s the serious stuff I\u2019m gathering. Like the sight of the lady who used to push a baby stroller done up in hot pink tiger stripes with sequined bows on the sun awning. A close look revealed it wasn\u2019t her child she was pushing. Well, not her human child, anyway. It was a shih-tzu-oodle-hua, one of those toy pooches bred not for walking or running like other wild critters, but a little fluff of squeaks to salve a lonely soul who doesn\u2019t have a hope of having grandchildren. And then my pity rolls out, because as awful as I find the tawdry contraption in which the yapper rides, I also respond to the woman\u2019s isolation, so removed from the world that she can best communicate with a mini dog that can\u2019t talk. Or walk.\nThe sensations, images, and words I\u2019ve collected on my walk will show up in my writing. I\u2019ll bring them to the front when I need to feel an activity in my gut, when I want to describe something with authentic detail. I\u2019ll twist, tweak, and change elements to suit, but they\u2019ll end up in some story. The best walks deliver the opening to writing gridlock that\u2019s kept me scribbling drivel for the last day or two. Engaged with story, I\u2019ll delete crap, write passages, correct problems, or know how to get my main character rolling off the sofa to make a decisive move in my WIP.\nBack home in an hour, I\u2019ve worked off 27 calories, 32 if I\u2019ve walked fast, a paltry effort at improving my health. But I\u2019ve started to write and can hardly wait to get on the computer. That\u2019s my routine, odd as it is. For me it works. Let me know what works for you.\nBecause if you don\u2019t, why should anyone else? Stop beating your chest already, Mom doesn\u2019t count. You must love your work, really love it.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T22:51:26Z", "url": "https://sharonboninpratt.wordpress.com/2014/03/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Every sport brings its own requirements for eyewear, including winter sports. Simon Briggs from Extreme-Eyewear, a specialist sports eyewear company, explains what the main issues are when choosing the right eyewear for your sport.\n\u201cSports eyewear requirements can be broken down into two main areas, eyewear fit and eyewear lenses.\n\u201cA sports person's eyewear needs to fit securely and comfortably, ensuring optimal performance in any situation. Each sport has its own requirements for sport sunglasses/eyewear. Many sports are played all year round so its important to have a sunglass lens in your sport sunglasses that will cope with a wide variety of sunlight conditions (from low light to heavy sunshine) or to have interchangeable lenses.\n\u201cSome sports are played on reflective surfaces such as water or snow where it is beneficial to have polarised lenses in your sport sunglasses to reduce the sun glare.\n\"The most popular correction comes in the form of an optical insert which is fitted with your prescription. The insert clips onto the back of the sport sunglasses enabling you to still interchange the \u2018main sunglass\u2019 lenses for different colours. As the insert can be removed this concept is also great for contact lens wearers.\"\n\"Cosmetically you can often tell there is an insert behind the sunglasses which makes them less than perfect for fashion prescription sunglasses but their functionality makes them idea for sport.\"\n\"The second form of correction is 'direct glazed' lenses, where your prescription is fitted into the eyewear frame. Two brands that excel are Oakley and Maui Jim, both manufacturing wrap-around lenses tailored to your prescription.\n\"Getting your ski goggles right is essential, when skiing or snowboarding a goggle has to be able to deliver good peripheral view, air circulation (to combat fogging), comfort and due to the popularity of helmets now be \u2018helmet compatible\u2019.\n\"There are a number of different sunglass and goggle hybrids available. These clever pieces of kit mean that you can buy your sunglasses and goggles at once. You simply buy a pair of sunglasses with sides that can be clicked off of the frame and replaced with a headband for a more secure fit.\n\"Some of these models include a padding system, which gives a more comfortable fit when worn as a goggle. The padding simply clicks into place on the back of the sunglass, and turns the sunglass into a full goggle.\"\n\"The prescription part of the correction is in the form of an optical insert that sits inside the skiing goggle, behind the main lens. The optical insert has no contact with your face making a perfect fit and allowing the goggle to fit as intended by the manufacturer.\nAre There Alternative Corrections Available?\"An alternative to optical inserts is to purchase 'Over the glass' ski goggles. These goggles are specifically designed to sit over the top of prescription glasses, having increased ventilation and a wide fit enabling your glasses to comfortably sit underneath.\"", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T19:02:35Z", "url": "http://www.wintertraveller.co.uk/importance-eyewear-ski-holiday.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "What\u2019s the difference? Great question. There\u2019s probably an official answer but honestly to me they\u2019re the same thing. The only difference is the type of pan you make it in. But honestly, you can make any tart recipe into a pie and any pie recipe in to a tart. So whether you want to call this a pie or a tart, I\u2019m ok with either.\nI took this to a potluck and I think I called it a pie. But now that I think about it, I made it in a tart pan so it should be called a tart. A tart sounds fancy, doesn\u2019t it?\nPie sounds homey. Tart sounds regal. I\u2019m ok with fancy business, but let\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m not a fan of expensive. My tart pan was $2.50 at the Good Will. I wanted to keep this dessert low budget too. I went to the store and looked for the cheapest fruit available. That\u2019s my strategy because generally the cheapest fruit is in season.\nNectarines were $0.50/lb. So awesome. It took about $1.50 worth of fruit to make this tart. Beautiful and frugal. I\u2019m into it.\nPrepare pie crust by combing flour, sugar and salt. Using your fingers, break the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles very coarse crumbs (even pea sized is fine). Add ice water and bring it all together into a ball using your hands. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate a few hours. You can make this up to two days in advance (or much longer and freeze it).\nOnce the dough has rested enough (a few hours or days), roll out and place into a 9 inch fluted tart pan (this will also work in a pie dish). Place in freezer while you make the filling and topping.\nDice nectarines (leave the skin on) and combine with sugar, flour, cinnamon and rum. Set aside and make the topping. In a bowl, combine ingredients for filling. Using your fingers, work ingredients together (feel free to add more pistachios if you\u2019d like) until the texture of coarse crumbs.\nNow assemble tart. Place nectarine filling into prepared tart pan. Top with crumble topping. Lay a few thin pats of butter over the top. Bake for about an hour and a half, or until filling is bubbling and top is golden.\nAllow to cool completely. Serve and enjoy!\nFor some reason I\u2019m thinking plum pie needs to happen sometime soon, because I never see plums in a pie.\nWhat\u2019s your favorite fruit pie? If you have an awesome recipe, share it in the comments!\nGood call on the dollop of yogurt. Normally, I\u2019d be all for ice cream but yogurt sounds amazing too!\nI love nectarines. I use them in recipes that call for peaches. I made an apple crumble last week. Nectarines would be good in place of apples too, I think!\nThat sounds absolutely delicious, will be giving it a go. And I always think a pie has a lid and a tart doesn\u2019t but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the official difference!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T04:11:59Z", "url": "https://foodologie.com/2013/08/11/nectarine-tart-with-pistachio-oat-crumble/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Entering the 12th floor of the Hangzhou National Animation Industry Base, the only tip-off that you haven\u2019t stepped into an internet bar is the absence of smoke. In a quiet, dimly lit room, young designers sit at rows of computers, modeling birds, locomotives and girls wearing capes.\nThis a cartoon command center, one of 16 nationwide. Set up over a three-year period thanks to tax incentives, subsidies and bonuses, the centers are part of Beijing\u2019s ambitious plan to cultivate an animation industry able to contribute 1% of national GDP within 10 years. The figure stood at 0.1% in 2005.\nChina\u2019s short-term strategy seems to be a production blitz coupled with government measures to ensure domestic cartoons are aired. China produced 102,000 minutes of animation in 2007, up 20% from the previous year and 137% from 2005, according to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, an investment bank.\nIn May, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television extended a 2006 ban on broadcasting foreign cartoons by an hour, creating a daily blackout period that runs from 5 pm to 9 pm. Stations must also show seven minutes of domestic cartoons for every three minutes of foreign output. As a result, Chinese animators claimed a 50% market share last year, up from 15% several years ago.\nBut a torrent of animation minutes does not add up to profits or prestige for most of the country\u2019s 5,400 cartoon companies. Though Beijing dreams of a world-class animation industry to compete with Disney or Dreamworks, a local industry champion is unlikely to emerge soon, as broadcasters still favor studios that produce cheaply and bountifully.\nFor televised animation, broadcasters like CCTV and provincial television stations pay studios by the minute. Higher-quality 3D animation fetches a higher price than 2D. Paying more for better animation should, in theory, attract more viewers, and allow stations to charge higher advertising rates. But state-controlled CCTV is less dependent on advertising revenue than a private broadcaster would be. Filling cartoon quotas \u2013 not boosting TV ratings \u2013 is its top priority. A survey by the China Animation & Comics Association found that only 11% of Chinese teenagers preferred domestic cartoons, compared with 60% who favored ones from Japan.\n\u201cLots of poor-quality animated TV shows are just being made blindly,\u201d said Ye Min, director of the animation series Magic Wonderland, produced by Hangzhou-based Zhongnan Animation.\nMany in the industry point to the low amount CCTV pays studios for their work as a major obstacle toward higher-quality animation.\nCCTV pays a \u201ca few hundred yuan\u201d per minute for animation, but production costs in China average RMB10,000 (US$1,500) per minute for 2D and RMB30,000 (US$4,400) for 3D, said Shen Yuliang, general manager of Zhongnan Animation. Last year, Zhongnan turned a profit for the first time since it was set up in 2005. It is rumored to be one of the only studios in Hangzhou to have crept into the black.\nFor studios, getting paid at all is an improvement over the old system.\n\u201cBefore, it was free for broadcasters to air cartoons,\u201d said Nie Jinxing, media relations manager at Sunchime Cartoon Group, which produces Blue Cat, one of China\u2019s most widely syndicated cartoon series since its launch in 1999. The company came close to bankruptcy in 2001, after spending US$8.7 million on production for a series that was broadcast by 15 television stations for free.\nThough producing cartoons to broadcast pro bono was an extreme, global animation markets aren\u2019t set up much differently. Worldwide, animation companies make very little money from broadcasting, but profit from DVDs, toys and other merchandise that the cartoon programs themselves advertise.\nUnfortunately for Chinese animators, these sources of revenue are virtually non-existent. Merchandizing is underdeveloped, while DVD sales are undermined by China\u2019s virulent pirate market.\nSunchime told Asia Times last year that it estimates the value of Blue Cat and its derivative products at US$582 million annually, but only makes US$14-29 million.\nPiracy and lack of profitability are also dissuading potential foreign investors.\nForeign studios have outsourced labor-intensive, technical animation work to China since the 1990s, but they rarely invest in the country\u2019s animation industry. This results in limited foreign expertise at China\u2019s new animation bases \u2013 one reason the industry is short of creative directors and storytellers.\nA creative vision to shape the millions of cartoon minutes into a world-class industry is not a matter of numbers.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T01:02:37Z", "url": "https://chinaeconomicreview.com/wishful-thinking/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

And I tell you what you eat and what you store in your houses....\"\nNeither Muhammad \u0003 nor Jesus came to change the basic doctrine of the belief in one God, brought by earlier prophets, but rather to confirm and renew it.\nMuslims also believe that God revealed a holy book to Jesus called the Injeel, some parts of which may be still available in the teachings of God to Jesus in the New Testament. But this does not mean that Muslims believe in the Bible we have today because it is not the original scriptures that were revealed by God. They underwent alterations, additions, and omissions.\nThis was also said by the Committee charged with revising The Holy Bible (Revised Standard Version). This Committee consisted of thirty-two scholars who served as members of the Committee. They secured the review and counsel of an Advisory Board of fifty representatives of the co-operating denominations. The Committee said in the Preface to The Holy Bible (Revised Standard Version), p. iv: \"Sometimes it is evident that the text has suffered in transmission, but none of the versions provides a satisfactory restoration. Here we can only follow the best judgement of competent scholars as to the most probable reconstruction of the original text.\" The Committee also said in the Preface, p. vii: \"Notes are added which indicate significant variations, additions, or omissions in the ancient authorities (Mt 9.34; Mk 3.16; 7.4; Lk 24.32, 51, etc.).\"\nBid'ah (innovation) in Islam is defined as any invented way in religion that is aimed at worshipping or drawing closer to Allaah subhanahu wata'ala. This means anything that is not referred to specifically in Sharee'ah, and for which there is no evidence (daleel) in the Qur'aan or Sunnah, and which was not known at the time of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and his Companions. At the same time, it is quite obvious that this definition of religious inventions or innovations, which are condemned, does not include worldly inventions [such as cars and washing machines, etc. - Translator].", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T21:01:28Z", "url": "https://www.linktoislam.net/islamic-articles/article.aspx?id=47", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "\"At this point, we're more concerned about the risk of a downgrade than a default,\" said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Belton said the loss of the country's AAA rating may rattle markets, but it's \"better than missing an interest payment.\"\nEven with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt limit less than a week away, many investors still believe Washington will pull off a last-minute deal to avoid a catastrophic default. Washington has until Aug. 2 to raise the country's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit or risk missing a payment on its debt. President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans have failed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and pass a larger budget-cutting package. Politicians have tied raising the debt limit and spending cuts together.\nBut at least one credit rating agency has already made it clear that unless that agreement includes at least $4 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade, the country's AAA rating could be lost. Right now, the proposals under discussion cut around $2 trillion or less.\nStandard & Poor's warned earlier this month that there was a 50-50 chance of a downgrade, if Congress and President Obama failed to find a \"credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.\" S&P said it may cut the U.S. rating to AA within 90 days. Passing a $4 trillion agreement could prevent a downgrade, S&P said.\nThe other chief rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the U.S. government would likely keep its top rating if it avoids a default.\nSpokesmen from both Moody's and S&P said they wouldn't comment beyond their recent reports.\nBelton estimates that borrowing costs would rise between 0.60 to 0.70 points. That may not sound like much. But mortgage interest rates, which have hovered around 4.5 percent for the last several weeks, could rise by at least that amount, to more than 5.1 percent.\nAnd for the federal government, it eventually means an extra $100 billion in interest payments to Treasury holders like China each year.\n\"That's a huge number,\" Belton said. That $100 billion a year that could be spent elsewhere on everything from education to infrastructure.\nAn increase in interest rates could soon become a drag on other parts of the economy, experts say. State governments and insurance agencies would also be downgraded \u2014 and states are already having financial troubles. Business confidence could sink again, leading to prolonged high unemployment.\nBut some investors aren't unhappy about the thought of a U.S. debt downgrade. Don Quigley, manager of the $1.5 billion Artio Total Return Bond fund reasons that such a move could provide a buying opportunity. He believes that a downgrade would immediately send the yield of the 10-year bond up to 3.15 percent from its current level of about 3 percent.\nIf the economy sinks further in part because of higher interest rates, investors would very likely return to buying bonds, Quigley said. That's what they've done during the last several years both during the financial crisis and recession, and again the last several months as the economic recovery has slowed.\nTreasurys would keep their allure, in part, because there are few alternatives for large foreign buyers looking for a market big enough to handle massive investments.\n\"The German market is not big enough and Japan has its own problems,\" Quigley said.\nA cut to the U.S. credit rating could hit stocks harder than bonds. A study by Janney Montgomery Scott looked at rating changes to countries over the past decade. After Spain was downgraded in 2009, Spain's stock market fell 8 percent in three months. A cut to Japan's credit rating in 2011 knocked the country's stock market down 3.4 percent in three months. The study, released in April, suggested the S&P 500 would fall 6% after a U.S. downgrade, erasing all its gains for the year.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T10:31:28Z", "url": "https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/debt-limit-downgrade1st-ldwritethru/2011/07/26/id/404944/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

I'm Wang Fei.\nWilliam: So, Wang Fei, today is 3 May.\nWilliam: Do you know what 3 May is?\nWang Fei: Hmm\u2026 a Tuesday?\nWilliam: Yes, it's a Tuesday, but it's not just any Tuesday. Today is World Press Freedom Day. This is the day that the United Nations has chosen to highlight the importance of a free press around the world.\nWang Fei: A free press. So, newspapers that are free to write anything they think the public need to know and TV news that can report anything?\nWilliam: Yes they can report anything, including things that look bad for the government! Scandals.\nWang Fei: A scandal, so something very bad that damages someone's reputation.\nWilliam: Exactly. And one of the most famous scandals from American history is the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s.\nWang Fei: Watergate\u2026 that was why President Nixon had to resign wasn't it?\nWilliam: Exactly, yes, because he was shown to have lied to the American people and basically obstructed the course of justice. The whole thing started when five men were arrested for breaking into an office block called Watergate. This was where the Democratic Party had their headquarters. Later on, the men were linked to the campaign to re-elect President Nixon, who was in the Republican Party.\nWang Fei: Well, this is very interesting but what has it got to do with The English We Speak, William?\nWilliam: Well, because Watergate was such a massive scandal, Wang Fei, the word -gate is now sometimes used as a suffix to suggest that something is a scandal. So, to give you an example from last year, when Gordon Brown was trying to get re-elected as British Prime Minister, he was overheard calling an old lady a \"bigot\" \u2013 a very strong word for somebody who is intolerant and close-minded. Anyway, this was a big scandal and it came to be known in the media as 'bigotgate'.\nWang Fei: Bigotgate. That sounds almost a little bit funny.\nWilliam: Yes, you're right. I think using -gate on the end of a word can make it seem a little humorous. This term -gate is used more in the USA, but another recent example from the UK is 'Climategate' \u2013 that was when some emails and other documents from a university in England led to people asking questions about the way that scientists researched climate change. Climategate.\nWang Fei: So, can we use \u2013gate in normal English conversation too?\nMan A: Have you seen Mark recently?\nMan B: Mark \u2013 he hasn't spoken to me since beergate!\nMan A: Beergate? What do you mean?\nMan B: We had a big argument because I said Mark never bought a round of beer in the pub! He got very upset and went home.\nWang Fei: So in that example, the speaker coined the word beergate to describe an argument about paying for beer!\nWilliam: Yeah, which is obviously very silly. But of course, this suffix -gate is used in very serious situations too. And it was thanks to members of the free press, including the Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, that the public came to know about Watergate.\nWang Fei: Yes. Check our website this week for more information and learning English programmes about World Press Freedom Day.

Xander has innumerable endorsements and has been featured on no fewer than 5 shows and sites, including The Real Radio Show with AJ Pero of Twisted Sister, Steve Vai\u2019s GuitarTV.com, GuitarWorld.com, Hair Metal Mansion and Iron City Rocks.\nMixed by CJ Snare of Firehouse, it contains 10 tracks of combustible guitar content. Mr. Demos will also be delivering an instructional DVD and sharing his skills to interested students. A collection of his endorsements include EMG Pickups, Conklin Guitars, ISP Technologies, David Thomas McNaught Guitars, GraphTech, V-Picks, Jim Dunlop Strings and Accessories, Hughes and Kettner, Tremol-No, FloydUpgrades.com, Scott Dixon Cases and Suhr Guitars, Amps & Effects. Xander exclusively uses the FloydUpgrades tremolos or the GraphTech LB-63 piezo-equipped Floyd tremolo and has Xander Demos signature series guitars both 6-string and 7-string models. However, you don\u2019t need to know extensive knowledge about guitars to enjoy his efforts.\nWhat Mr. Demos delivers is a really diverse range that is both nostalgic and new. You can head-bang without the head ache, as he comes through clean and clear, cutting like a capable musical carver. Also an avid animal aid, Xander donated some of his EP sales to various animal charities. When you add it all up, Xander Demos is the correct answer to the mathematical musical equation, and that\u2019s always a lesson I look forward to learning!\nSara Fincham: Talk about the importance of Pittsburgh in your work.

He will be succeeded as chairman by non-executive director John Reynolds from October 1.\nAs well as working with councils to advance schemes in Kingston- upon- Thames, Leeds, Peterborough and Sheffield, Hammerson said it believed there were opportunities to \"extend and enhance\" a number of its existing shopping centres, including Bernt Cross in north London, West-Quay in Southampton and The Oracle in Reading.\nHammerson also forecast growth in office rents next year, when it expects to benefit from a low level of new supply, particularly in the City of London, and further falls in vacancy rates during the remainder of this year.\nThe company is also confident that office lettings will improve from their recent below-par performance.\nEarnings per share fell 23.6 per cent, from 94.5p to 72.2p.\nHowever, the interim dividend payment rises 6.4 per cent, from 5.45p to 5.8p per share.\nShares closed up 8p at 887p.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T14:42:50Z", "url": "https://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/hammerson-shrugs-high-street-gloom-3993396", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

This is a way of showcasing the brand experience \u2013 we want to be synonymous with creativity,\u201d de Maillard says.\nThere are no Vans products for sale at House of Vans, although there is a museum showcasing some of the brands iconic products. De Maillard says the aim is not to sell but to immerse people in the Vans brand and make them feel part of the \u201cVans family\u201d.\nHe hopes that by making this investment the brand will experience a boost in brand equity, loyalty and increased purchase consideration and transactions.\nIt will be launching a membership programme that gives subscribers advantages such as priority for gig tickets and skateboarding sessions. For the most loyal, there are plans to offer \u201cVIP\u201d events such as a private session in the skate park with some of the big names in skateboarding.\nVans will not charge for the scheme itself but will require members to donate what they can afford to its charity partners.\nIt is also extending the project into the digital world with the aim of reaching a further 1 million people that might not be able to attend the space in person. The whole place is wired with HD cameras and Vans is planning live web casts of big events that will be shared on a dedicated House of Vans London website, as well as on social media.\nThere is also free Wi-Fi throughout the space so visitors can share their experiences on social media.\n\u201cWe are trying to mix the digital and physical worlds. The consumer today is on their phone the whole time but we believe there is still a strong need for physical experiences and the more the world becomes digital the more meaningful and impactful those true authentic physical experiences become,\u201d says de Maillard.\nLondon is the second House of Vans project to go live, with the first opening in Brooklyn in 2010. It opens to the public tomorrow (9 August) and will be open five days a week.\nA new report on omnichannel commerce shows that UK retailers are lagging behind their American counterparts in digital and in-store offerings, despite serving the world\u2019s most mature ecommerce market. But even the US still hasn\u2019t worked out the conundrum of linking up stock data.\nBeing the summer, I have had more time to chat with my teenage kids. As they have got older, they have become (a little) more interested in what I do for a living \u2013 perhaps as it starts to dawn on them that one day they too will have to enter the deep dark world of employment, and it would be wise to avoid the jobs that their parents do, as it seems like hard work.\nTwitter is revamping its pricing model for campaigns, allowing advertisers to purchase ads based on what it claims are \u201cobjective-based\u201d goals designed to inject variety into its cost-per-engagement model.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T00:55:11Z", "url": "https://www.marketingweek.com/2014/08/01/vans-looks-to-prove-creative-credentials-with-london-event-space/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "F1600 Formula F Championship Series alum Aaron Telitz claimed two victories for the Team USA Scholarship and Cliff Dempsey Racing at this weekend\u2019s 43rd annual Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch, but fell short of the ultimate prize when he spun into the gravel trap while challenging for the lead in the Final.\nTeammate Michai Stephens, 22, from Evanston, Ill., once again was struck by misfortune in his Semi Final race this morning and was unable to qualify for the Final. Stephens had driven impressively to work his way from 25th on the grid to 12th, only to be forced off the road when veteran driver Rick Morris made a rare mistake while Stephens was in the process of passing him around the outside at Clearways.\nTelitz, 22, from Birchwood, Wis., put on another clinic during his Semi Final round. He made an exemplary start from the pole and led all 15 laps to ensure a place on the front row of the grid for the 20-lap Grand Final. He had to be content with the outside position, due to the fact his Semi Final had been interrupted by two Safety Car periods which ensured a slower average speed than Semi Final 2. Undeterred, Telitz made a good start and immediately began to pressurize race leader Jonny McMullan.\nOn Lap 4, Telitz carried more momentum onto the Brabham Straight and drafted to the left of McMullan on the undulating approach to the first corner, Paddock Hill Bend. The pair ran side-by-side toward the apex of the turn, whereupon Telitz\u2019s car just got away from him and he performed a lazy spin into the gravel trap, from which there was no escape.\nTelitz and Stephens will now regroup and return to action on Thursday at Silverstone for two more days of testing prior to next weekend\u2019s Walter Hayes Trophy event for which over 100 Formula Ford cars are currently entered.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T13:26:10Z", "url": "http://www.f1600series.com/news/955-telitz-stars-for-team-usa-scholarship-at-the-formula-ford-festival.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "This past summer a pregnant woman was punched in the face while walking along a street in Brooklyn. She was knocked out, but, fortunately, no lasting harm came to her or to her baby. The assailant, a 33-year old man, was quickly apprehended in what seems to be a completely random act of violence.\nNo question that the attack was terrible, but is the neighbor\u2019s conclusion accurate? Should we \u2013 all of us \u2013 fear everyone? I guess, on the one hand, that we might be safer if we do: if we assume that every person, in every situation is trying to hurt us for no reason at all, we will always act to protect ourselves. We will never approach a stranger to say hello or ask if they need help; we will never even smile at them as they walk by. We will always lock our doors, our windows, our cars, and we will always ask ourselves if we are leaving ourselves open to attack \u2013 on the street, at work or school, on the bus or train, at the mall, in the park\u2026 but is that how we want to live?\nYears ago, before 9/11, I gave a sermon in which I asked how many people at that Yom Kippur service knew anyone personally who had been murdered. Out of 900 people in the room, four raised their hands. Now I ask you the same question: with the exception of the vile, calculated attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, how many friends, relatives or acquaintances of yours have been murdered, or even suffered serious injury, at the hand of a stranger?\nI spent a lot of time thinking about this before realizing that the answer, for me, is exactly zero. A relative died in World War II, and a college roommate was killed by a rival for his girlfriend\u2019s affections, but not a single friend, relative or acquaintance of mine has been murdered or seriously hurt by a stranger. When I consider how many thousands of people I have known over the course of my life, that\u2019s seems pretty amazing.\nBut is it so amazing? If we listen to the news it sounds like people are being punched in the face every day, on every street corner. However, if we remember that over 8 million people live in New York City, and another 8 \u00bd million live in New Jersey, then our chances of being punched by a random stranger on one day in August seem to be around 16,500,000 to one. And since it hasn\u2019t happened again since that day, the chances are hundreds of millions to one. But you wouldn\u2019t know that from the news.\nThe job of any news organization is not, actually, to give us the news; it is to make us watch or listen or click or read, so they can sell whatever it is they sell to stay in business. Our job is to ask ourselves whether the reports of random violence are relevant to us and whether we should adjust our lives in response. If someone told me that a knife-wielding lunatic was seen in my development, you can be sure I would bolt the doors. But hearing that a man in Brooklyn punched a pregnant woman, despicable as it was, does not lead me to the conclusion that I \u201chave to be afraid of everyone.\u201d It doesn\u2019t even mean that every person in Brooklyn has to be afraid of everyone.\nFrom the TSA farce at airports to security cameras monitoring cars at Freehold Raceway Mall, we are told to be afraid all day, every day. News reports make it sound like we are lucky to get through a single day without harm. But our life experiences do not bear this out.\nYes, bad things happen in life. But far, far fewer than we imagine. The news has its place and purpose, but we should not let it define our lives for us.\n\u201cFear everyone\u201d is a terrible motto to live by. We deserve better.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T08:34:20Z", "url": "https://trt.org/rabbi-blog-2/should-we-fear-everyone/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The story is full of imagery and symbolism, depicting history through the lives of seemingly irrelevant people in the Egyptian population.\nADEF DECA, a cultural hub that aims to create a space for freedom of expression through technology, and strives to build an intellectual environment of mutual respect, is hosting a special screening of the movie, Chitchat on the Nile, tonight.

Part of this is due to the growing popularity of blogs, and partly because web users are becoming a little more savvy.\nOnce upon a time there was a web user. We\u2019ll call her Betty. Betty found a blog she liked to read, and she checked back daily for new posts. Then Betty found out about some more blogs she liked, so she started checking those daily too. It wasn\u2019t look before Betty was checking 30 blogs every day \u2013 and wow, it was starting to take a while!\nThis is where RSS feeds come in.

{"text": "The question arises, of course, \u201cWho are or what are they calling?\u201d Some say that the cry is for the four horsemen to come forth. Others say that they are calling for John to come and see. But it seems to me that the cry to \u201cCome\u201d is most consistently used in the book of Revelation to cry out to the Lamb to come and establish His kingdom. But when this happens, as we see in chapter six, the Lamb and His people encounter intense resistance and opposition.\nFour times, the living creatures call out \u201cCome!\u201d Four times, a horseman rides out. The first is armed with a bow (a weapon frequently associated with the enemies of God in Scripture). He goes out conquering and to conquer, we read in verse 2. Ironically, when God\u2019s enemies believe that they are conquering Him and His people (13:7), they are actually being conquered (17:14). The second horseman (v.3) is permitted the right to kill God\u2019s people with the sword. Jesus\u2019 words in Matthew 10:34 are likely being alluded to here when He says, \u201cDo not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.\u201d The third horseman (v.5) brings economic hardship upon those who follow the Lamb. They are forced to pay inflated prices or given restricted access to the basic necessities of life. This type of economic oppression is a common tactic of persecutors the world over and it grinds God\u2019s people down. It is one thing to suffer hunger yourself but to watch your children suffer hunger and deprivation because of your faith can be demoralizing and make the temptation to deny Christ all the more attractive. Finally the fourth horseman rides out (v.7), bringing disease and death to the people of God. Deprived, oppressed, and mistreated, it would almost appear that the prayer to \u201cCome\u201d is disastrous to the people of God. But then the fifth seal is broken.\nAnd so we read in verse 11, \u201cThen they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.\u201d This is how God will accomplish His purposes; through those who sacrificially do His will even unto death.\nJesus will come back. The prayers of God\u2019s people and the four living creatures will finally be answered. According to Revelation 6:11, it is when the last martyr has been killed; the last witness has been slain because of his/her testimony. Then God will say, \u201cIt is finished!\u201d (16:17), the gates will be closed, heaven will be sealed, and Christ will return to judge the world. This is seen with the breaking of the sixth seal in 6:12-14. Notice that with this broken seal, as with the previous five, there are prayers being uttered, but this time the prayers ushered forth are from those who have participated in opposing God\u2019s purposes. Rich and poor, powerful and powerless, slave and free, they, like Adam, attempt to hide from the One they opposed.[ii] As creation dissolves into chaos at His coming, they cry out \u201cWho can stand in the day of God\u2019s wrath?\u201d The answer is found in the next chapter; only those who belong to the Lamb are able to stand (7:3)! While the Church may seem to be wounded and bleeding in this world, those wounds are, like those of the Lamb; evidence that Christ\u2019s kingdom is, indeed, coming (Matt. 6:10).\nIn Acts 1:3, Luke introduces his account by informing Theophilus that in the time between Jesus resurrection and His ascension, Jesus gave commands to His disciples and \"presented himself alive after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God\" (Acts 1:1-3). In Luke 24:13-35, he recounts how Jesus met up with two of His followers on the road to Emmaus, probably heading away from Jerusalem to a place of safety. Jerusalem had become a hostile place for the followers of Jesus. They had witnessed the crucifixion of their Lord, and despite reports that Jesus had risen from the dead, they obviously had their doubts. They decided that it was time to move on before the followers of Jesus were tracked down as well.\nAs they traveled to Emmaus, Luke records that these two unidentified disciples found themselves engaged in conversation with a fellow traveler about the events that had just taken place in Jerusalem and how Jesus had been killed. The traveler listens to them explaining what they had heard and gone through. Finally he interjects, \"O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?\" (Luke 24:25-26).\nWith that as a basic outline, - suffering followed by glory \u2013 He walked them through the entire story of Scripture (verse 27). With Christ at the centre of it all, the events in Jerusalem began to make sense. The Servant of God had to suffer in order to be glorified.\nWhen the disciples were finally allowed to realize that it had been Jesus, Himself, who had been speaking to them, they raced back to Jerusalem to report to the other disciples what they had experienced. There they found them in a barricaded room, obviously in fear of their lives.\nAs the two disciples recount how Jesus spoke with them, suddenly Jesus appeared in their midst. In verse 45, we read that He opened their minds to understand the Scripture, \"and said to them, \"Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem ( Luke 24:46-47).\nChrist\u2019s suffering and rising from the dead was to be shared worldwide. It could not be restricted to one group in one room in one city. The global expansion of the gospel would start with them in Jerusalem, but it would not end there.\nDuring the next thirty-nine days, we read in Acts 1 that Jesus went over the theme of the kingdom of God many times with His disciples. He stresses in verse 4 that they are not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for the promised Holy Spirit. Telling people not to leave town may seem like a strange way to launch a worldwide missionary movement.\nActs 1: 8 reads, \"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.\"\nThe first seven chapters deal with the spread of the gospel in Jerusalem. Chapters 8:1-11:18 record how the message of Jesus is spread throughout Judea and Samaria. Starting in 11:19, the focus is the spread of the gospel to the \"ends of the earth\". When Luke\u2019s account ends in chapter 28, it does so rather suddenly as if to emphasize that the story is not complete; we, the readers, continue the mission. It is clear that Luke\u2019s focus in chapter 28 is not on Paul\u2019s fate but the progress of the gospel. The book does not close with the end of Paul\u2019s life or martyrdom but with Paul, \"proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.\" These last words stand as an encouragement for all followers of Christ to do the same as the gospel continues to be carried \"to the ends of the earth.\"\nThe spread of the gospel, however, begins in Jerusalem. This begs the question, \"Why? Why was this necessary? Why did the proclamation of the gospel have to start in Jerusalem?\" Before we address this question, however, we need to put aside three inadequate explanations that are sometimes proposed.\nFirst, the gospel did not begin in Jerusalem because it was home to the disciples and thus they would find a more ready or receptive audience. Jerusalem was not home for any of the disciples. They were from Galilee, not Jerusalem. The angels in Acts 1:11 addressed them as \"Men of Galilee.\" The people of Jerusalem could easily pick out the disciples by their Galilean accents, even in the dark (cf. Matt.26:73, Luke 22:59). Regional prejudices would not have made Galileans the most suitable messengers for the more urbane citizens of Jerusalem, nor would the disciples have felt at home in the city. Their home was in the smaller towns and rural areas of Galilee.\nThe reality is that there was only one beginning of the gospel. In God\u2019s history there will never be another subsequent Pentecost point. Every later initiative is a down-line fruition of that outpouring and obedience. We are now in the \"the uttermost parts,\" not repeating the scenario reaching of \"our-own-Jerusalem.\" Acts 1:8 is a geographical reference as much as it is a historical one.\nSecondly, the spread of gospel did not begin in Jerusalem because it would be the safest place to start and the disciples would be able to get experience in witnessing before moving on to more difficult or resistant areas. Rather the opposite was true. The most dangerous place on earth for the disciples to start their ministry was in Jerusalem. Avowed enemies with the power to throw them in prison had tried to arrest them in the garden of Gethsemane only days before (Mark 14:50-52; John 18:8-9). They would likely try again.\nThirdly, Jerusalem was not chosen to be the starting place for the spread of the gospel because the city was familiar territory for the disciples where ministry experience would prepare them for more unfamiliar ministry later on. Looking at the gospels, one finds that Jesus and His disciples spent relatively little time in Jerusalem. The urban setting of Jerusalem was unfamiliar to the rural Galileans. As noted earlier, there was a regional rivalry between those of Jerusalem and those of Galilee. Neither thought overly fondly of the other. Had Jesus wanted the disciples to start in more familiar territory to gain experience, He undoubtedly would not have chosen Jerusalem. Besides, the disciples were hardly novices to ministry. They had spent over three years with Jesus. He had sent them out on at least two mission trips already. They were fully prepared apart from one thing: they lacked the Holy Spirit.\nThe implications of this promise [i.e. Acts 1:8] are enormous. First of all, it tells the disciples that they will not be alone in the battle; the Holy Spirit will be in them and with them. Secondly, it makes them aware that this battle is actually not their own; it is God\u2019s initiative and God\u2019s action and concern. They are His ambassadors, fully endowed with His authority and power. Thirdly, whatever they will achieve will be God\u2019s achievement, because God\u2019s Spirit has acted through them.\nJesus spoke seldom of the Holy Spirit\u2019s function, but when He did so, frequently described Him as helper and comforter in persecution (Matt. 10:17-20; Mark 13:9-11; Luke 21:12-19). No wonder that Paul follows the Lord\u2019s example in his catalogue of his sufferings by attributing his endurance to the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 6:6). In Philippians 1:19, he writes, \"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.\" He reminds the Thessalonians, that \"ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost\" (1 Thess 1:6-7).\nSecond, Jerusalem was God\u2019s appointed starting place for the spread of the gospel because there were considerable missiological and theological reasons for doing so. While some might argue that the disciples might have drifted back to the comfort zone of their homes in Galilee had they been allowed to leave Jerusalem, I think it more likely that Jesus' instructions were more missiologically and theologically oriented. Jerusalem was the centre of monotheistic worship on the globe. It was the focal point of God's covenant with mankind. Christianity needed to be seen to be in continuity with what had gone on before in God\u2019s plan, rather than being potentially labeled as a Galilean sect.\nThe ultimate reason for the collection project rests upon the fact that Paul was constrained by prophecies which spoke of the nations coming to Israel to worship its King (cf. Is. 60:4-14; 66:19-24; Ps. 72:8-11). As a result of seeing believing Gentiles coming to Jerusalem (Acts 20:4 with 21:15-19), Paul hoped that Israel would be provoked to jealousy so that it might repent and accept Jesus as its Messiah (cf., Rom. 10:1; 11:11-24). Accordingly, Paul\u2019s priestly gift is the Gentiles themselves (Rom. 15:16) to verify that the God of Israel had also become the God of the Gentiles and that there is now only one people of God comprised of all nations (Gal. 3:28-29; Eph. 3:4-6).\nHence, Paul was careful to make sure to emphasize the continuity between Jerusalem and how God had worked in the past, with the present spread of the gospel to the ends of the earth among the Gentiles. The latter was a result of the unfolding plan of God begun with the Jews, fulfilled in Christ and proclaimed through the Church.\nI maintain that this is why the disciples stayed in Jerusalem, just as they had been instructed. When the Spirit came upon them, they immediately began to witness publicly, despite the risk. When persecution came, they did not scatter. They remained in Jerusalem where it was most strategic \u2013 and the most dangerous.\nThey were arrested, shamed, beaten, censured, but they continued. Eventually, one of them, James, was killed (12:2), but even then they remained, refusing to flee. They made no attempt to hide themselves. They knew that for the gospel to spread most effectively, they needed to remain in Jerusalem. It was only after an angel broke Peter out of prison and told him to leave, that he finally found a safer place out of town, but there is no indication that the rest of the apostles left or that Peter stayed away any longer than was necessary.\nWere the disciples being disobedient to the commission of Christ by staying in Jerusalem? I do not think so. They were being the catalyst by which the Church, itself, spread throughout the world. They were busy laying the foundations for a movement that would shake the known world of their day.\nThey worked in ways that consciously served to advance the spread of the gospel (Acts 6:4). They monitored carefully the expansion of the gospel and when they heard of the gospel advancing, they moved immediately to validate, bless and support it (Acts 8:14-25; 11:22). When it became clear that the churches had multiplied throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, Peter, himself, toured the entire region, helping the Church to increase (9:31-32). It was during this time, that God used him to share the gospel with the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius, demonstrating that God accepts all people into His family, regardless of race. Because the disciples were faithful in remaining in Jerusalem, despite the risks, they were in a position to walk through the door that God had opened to all nations.\nWhat are some of the common themes that come out of this survey?\nPersecution provides more opportunities to witness.\nWhen they fled, the disciples did not go \"underground\". They continued to preach. In Acts, witnessing is always public.\nOpposition inevitably followed the preaching of the gospel. While persecution does cause the Church to scatter in Acts, thereby spreading the gospel, it would be a mistake to conclude the relationship between persecution and church growth is best defined thus. The testimony of Acts is not so much that persecution causes church growth but that church growth and the spread of the gospel tends to cause persecution, as religious and political leaders rise up and try to stop this movement that has \"caused trouble all over the world and has now come here\" (Acts 17:6).\nPersecution came from various sources and in a variety of ways. The explanation for why the believers were persecuted in the book of Acts cannot be traced back to one single reason.\n 24:16 indicates that the disciples were kept from recognizing Him and 21:30 speaks of their eyes being \"opened.\" No fault should be laid on the disciples for failing to recognize their Lord.\n Steven Hawthorne, \"Acts of Obedience\" in Perspectives on the World Christian Movement: A Reader 3rd edition. William Carey Library, 1999:126.\n Josef Ton, Suffering, Martyrdom and Rewards in Heaven. University of America Press, 1997: 315.\n cf. G\u00fcnther Bornkamm, \"The Letter to the Romans As Paul's Last Will and Testament\" in The Romans Debate. ed. Karl P. Donfried. Augsburg Publishing House, 1977: 19. Bornkamm: 18-19 also makes the astute observation that Paul was obviously concerned that the Jewish Christians might not accept this collection and accept such a demonstrate of unity between Jew and Gentile in the church and so he asks for the Roman church to pray that that his service to the saints in Jerusalem would be acceptable to them (15:31).\n Christopher Little, \"Whatever Happened to the Apostle Paul?\" Mission Frontiers, September 2001: 27.\n This concept was first introduced to me by Vernon J. Sterk in his article \"You Can help the Persecuted Church,\" International Journal of Missionary Research. January 1999: 15-18, as he discussed the growth of the Church in the Mexican state of Chiapas. His field research and doctrinal dissertation on the dynamics of persecution led him to conclude that 1) the acceptance of the gospel message leads to persecution, and 2) persecution negatively affects the growth of the Church. However, he notes, the damaging effects can be minimized through an adequate preparation for, and proper response to, persecution. He also notes that an essential part of that response must be the prayers and involvement of the worldwide Church. On a personal note, my research on the biblical theology of persecution and discipleship has been born out of a desire to help prepare the church for and in persecution.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T09:21:04Z", "url": "http://theologyofpersecution.blogspot.com/2009/05/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

It allows nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) an overwhelming reason to rejoice. The other reason being that both professions saw an increase in salaries last year.\nFull-time salaries increased by more than $5,000 for both fields according to the 2013 National Salary Survey of NPs & PAs, which is an annual survey conducted by ADVANCE for NPs & PAs. Pay scales can also vary depending on market conditions and employers, though information from the salary report is good news for the healthcare industry overall.\nThese figures represent a major increase from numbers recorded in 2012 when NPs made over $8,000 less than what they earned in 2013. The PA salary increase, which rose by $13,000, was slightly higher over the two-year span.\nLast year, the average full-time nurse practitioner earned a salary of $98,817 while the average full-time physician assistant earned $107,268. The results from the survey showed that hourly wages for PAs were the only ones that slightly decreased.\nIf the overall expectations for NP and PA salaries remain constant, then both are on their way to being extremely financially-rewarding professions in the healthcare industry.\nNP PA Recruiters is a full-service healthcare staffing company committed to keeping employers and career seekers informed with up-to-date industry information. Whether you are searching for a new career or are trying to fulfill your staffing needs, our consultants are available to help you achieve your goals.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T10:32:03Z", "url": "https://npparecruiters.com/category/salaries/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Although the official language of Jamaica is Standard English, many Jamaicans also speak Patois which is a separate dialect/language. Jamaican Patois (also known as \u201cPatwa\u201d, \u201cPatwah\u201d or \u201cJamaican Creole\u201d) is the language that is used by most Jamaicans in casual everyday conversations while Standard English is normally reserved for professional environments.\n\"Jamaican Patois is a separate language from Jamaican English.\"\nJamaican Patois is a strange language in that it has many borrowed words from many different languages, for example, English, Spanish and some West African languages. However, the pronunciations of these words are very similar to Jamaican English. One thing to keep in mind as you learn Jamaican Patois is that it is not a strict, rule-oriented language where there is a \"right way\" and a \"wrong way\" to say things. Some words can be pronounced and spelled differently but still mean the same thing (e.g. both \u2018Pickney\u2019 and \u2018Pickeney\u2019 translates to \u2018Child'). The important thing is whether or not what you are saying can be understood.\nIt's actually quite difficult to acquire the accent of a Jamaican, unless you've lived in Jamaica for many years, and even then, speaking patois fluently is not guaranteed. But with a little practice, you will be able to have at least a basic understanding of Jamaican Patois.\nLet us now take a look at some of the grammatical features of Jamaican Patois.\nSentences in Jamaican Patois are built like English sentences in that, there is a subject, a predicate (or verb), and an object. However, there is no subject-verb agreement in Jamaican Patois. The verb does not change with the subject. Let us look at the table below.\nHowever, in Jamaican Patois a word can be pluralized by adding 'dem' to the end word or, inserting 'nuff' or a number at the beginning of the word.\nThere is no differentiation in the use of pronouns to show gender. The pronoun 'im' can mean both or either 'he' or 'she'.\nThere is no distinction between subject and object.\nThe copula is a connecting word; for example, in Jamaican Patois the copula is the letter 'a' which is used for the particle as well as for the continuous tense.\nIn Standard English it is never acceptable to use double negatives such as 'nobody does not'. However, in\u2022 Jamaican Patois double negatives are accepted.\nBy now you probably have a basic understanding on the differences between Jamaican Patois and Standard English, for a more detailed guide, you can check out our how to speak Jamaican Patois series.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T14:05:01Z", "url": "http://jamaicanpatwah.com/b/how-to-speak-jamaican-patois", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Emeritas Kerr and his Tocs Borderers patrol are ambushed by Yordist insurgents whilst on patrol.\nEmeritas Kerr began the morning patrol as he always did, with a long forward drop of his well-muscled, tattooed right arm. As the other three Tocs Borderers took their intervals in the snaking Indian single file line behind him, Kerr wondered if they were going to be hit today. Other patrols had taken a walloping in the past month. He and his men had been lucky so far.\nImprovised Explosive Devices (IEDs) created from scavenged military munitions, mines, old fashioned dynamite or in some cases a few hundred pounds of fertilizer, easily found on the surrounding farms outside of the city. Bomb making had seemingly become a fashionable hobby among the remaining Yordist insurgents left behind ensuring the populace remained stirred up and unable to make a normal life for themselves.\nThe squad sighed with relief as one as they rested packs against the cool shady wall of the fountain. It\u2019s bubbling water cool and tranquil to the mind. Kerr filled his pipe and kept watch on the rooftops and alleys as his lads drank water, smoked and hurriedly wolfed down a bit of cold ration. His squad\u2019s chosen man, Craig Cormier, silently chewed on a dry cracker topped with some sort of meat paste as he watched the locals moving by them as they sat. He would bring up the rear of the formation when they moved out on the second leg of the routine patrol.\nThese patrols never took the same route, they always changed, but this precaution was somewhat affected by the fact they had to always cover the same ground. Ground dictated by the confines of their current area of operation this made them vulnerable to sudden attack by a variety of different means.\nThe ten minute respite passed all too quickly.\n\u201cOff and on! Time ta earn yer pay.\u201d Kerr commanded his Borderers. Once again the patrol paced its way along the street, the crowd thinning as they went, until there were only a very few civilians around them. Kerr tensed, his senses on edge as he noted this. Sometimes in Yordist friendly areas the civilians were warned of bad things about to happen. Passing a short row of vendors carts Chosen Man Cormier was startled to see one of the brightly coloured cart balloons seem to catch the breeze and break away from its fellows in the bunch. Cormier\u2019s guts froze as he realized there was no wind!\nKerr felt himself get pushed to the ground by the blast wave before he heard the roar of the explosion close behind him. He tried to focus but his mind was numb. He was slow to react to the stinging chips of brick splattering his body as the incoming 9mm rounds chewed up the walls and suddenly he noticed one of them was, Cormier had charged forward towards the ambush point and was laying down covering fire and yelling for the others to pull themselves together and \u201cGet a bloody move on!\u201d There were civilians screaming and crying all around them as they scrambled to get out of the way of the fighting. The scene seemed surreal as while Kerr could see lips moving and weapons flashes, he couldn\u2019t hear a single sound.\nA copy of IAG001 Firefight 2.0 Killing Streets for the Firefight rules is necessary to play this mission. Also required are two squads of ION Age Muster miniatures.\nThis mission is for two players, with one player taking a Canlastrian squad of Mustermen out on a routine street patrol.\nThe other player commands a squad of Yordist Mustermen insurgents, out to destroy the Canlastrians by any and all means possible.\nThe objective of this mission for the Yordist is to kill every single Canlastrian mercenary, utilizing the surprise blast of a concealed Air Mine and a hidden ambush to do so.\nThe objective of this mission for the Canlastrian player is to survive the initial onslaught, recover and then destroy their attackers. See the special rules for this scenario.\nA line of four street boards running North-South. It is flanked by buildings and alleyways. The alleyways are represented by 2x5 pavement sections. The Yordist player can place three Skimmers (1x2, DS2), two of the big cars (2x2, DF3) and one of the small cars (2x2, DF2) to represent market vendor\u2019s stalls anywhere on the road edges. Then place 2 debris markers randomly on each street board (use 1D6 x 1D6 to determine square, just re-roll any sixes).\nYou have a 105 point veteran squad of Muster troops. One veteran Emeritas and three Privates, all armed with Moth Type VI Automatic Rifles. You may have four troopers armed with a Hobbes Bomb or two troopers armed with two Hobbes Bombs each. Place the Scouts on any of the P1 starting places at the south end of the battlefield. On game turn one, your patrol will move north with the intent of exiting the north end of the street on the other side of the battlefield.\nThere are no alternate options for this squad.\nYou have a 96 point squad of Muster troops. One Emeritas and three Privates, all armed with Moth Type VI Automatic Rifles. You may have up to two troopers armed with a Hobbes Bomb each or one trooper armed with two Hobbes Bombs.\nYou also have one Air Mine to place, before play begins secretly designate one Skimmer on the board to be your Air Mine booby trapped vendor cart. It\u2019s placement will designate where your squad will deploy (details below). Its cost is included in the calculated total force points above.\nYour forces do not start the game on the board. Once the Air Mine has detonated and damage calculated, immediately deploy your forces as follows: Place two men in the building across the road, opposite from where the Air Mine/Skimmer was initially placed, on \u2018off-board\u2019 squares adjacent to the road (see special rules for building details and the map for an example of where these deployment squares would be if the centre skimmer was the Air Mine). Then place a stolen 1x2 Skimmer, on any alley entryway of your choice (the front of the vehicle level with the road, example shown on map) at least 2D6 squares ahead of the place where the mine detonates. The Skimmer may immediately move up to 1D6 plus 1 squares, where the remaining two men get out of the vehicle and deploy behind it. Note that on the turn of deployment the Yordists may not move. They may use all of the normal Target Response Options although the two men by the Skimmer are down 1 dice on this first turn. From the following turn Initiative is rolled for as normal.\nThere are two special rules in use for this mission. Please read and apply it in your playing of Firefight for this mission.\n1. IED \u2013 In this mission the Air Mine is used slightly differently to normal. As the Canlastrian patrol is the only one on the table at the start of the scenario, each turn before the Canlastrians move the Yordist player can move any one of the 1x2 Skimmers on the board 1 space towards the Canlastrians. He does not have to move the one with the Air Mine. He may detonate the mine on any turn he wishes before the Canlastrians move. Once detonated and damage calculated he then deploys his forces as above. This rule represents the Canlastrians belief they are moving through a marketplace, and are not expecting an Air Mine to be hidden in one of the vendors carts.\n2. Buildings \u2013 The \u2018off-board\u2019 sections between alleyways are considered to be buildings. After the Air Mine has detonated and the Yordists deployed, the central square of the building they are in which faces each alleyway and the road are considered normal entrances into the building. It costs two general dice to move through. On the accompanying map an example of these entrances are shown, marked by green squares. The Yordists in the building are initially placed adjacent to the wall facing the road. They count as being in Hard Cover when being targeted, it does not affect them firing as per the normal rules.\nThis mission is part of the Pacification Firefight 2.0 Campaign Mission Arc, set after the fall of Bosworth IV, and should be played with other missions in the Arc in the correct order.\nIt may also be played as a stand-alone scenario, in which case it may be expanded by up to two squads of mustermen per side. Or you may try using Retained posts instead of mustermen, or a mix of Mustermen and the Retained to fight the scenario. It makes for a highly entertaining game.\nThis mission is the fifth of a series of missions in a Firefight 2.0 Campaign Arc which is meant to show the difficulties faced by an occupying force in a built up area in time of war. I have drawn upon the reports of recent military experiences in the modern age and have applied them to this mission arc. When the players have finished all of the missions, it is my hope they will be enlightened to the truly difficult job military personnel have when forced by circumstance and orders to occupy and garrison a city in a foreign land.\nThis mission introduces the guerrilla or \u2018small war\u2019 tactic of ambush, which the players will find to be a very deadly game for their soldiers.\nIn play testing this mission, my brave Tocs were able to recover and fight their Yordist foes to a draw twice in three games. The third game a number of fortunate rolls for the Yordist enabled them to wipe out the Canlastrians without losing a man! Such is the fickle hand of Lady Fate.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T18:16:46Z", "url": "http://www.orcsinthewebbe.co.uk/index.php/supported-games/the-ion-age/53-firefight/492-ambush", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "What is a Termite Bond? What are Bonds Good For?\nWhat is a Termite Bond? What are They Good For & are Bonds Worth the Cost?\n>> What is a Termite Bond? What are They Good For & are Bonds Worth the Cost?\nWondering how much is your termite bond?\nYou found termite damage to your house, went through the whole process of hiring an exterminator to inspect the damage, then had several treatments to take care of the problem. This shouldn\u2019t be the end of your efforts to eradicate termites from your home, however, since a house with previous termite damage is likely to experience a recurrence of the infestation at some point in the future.\nPeople in places like Alabama are fond of saying, \u201cThere are two kinds of houses: those with termites and those that will have them.\u201d How can you keep up with extermination costs that potentially recur every year? Look into the benefits of a termite bond.\nWhat is a termite bond? It is a contract or guarantee entered into between a homeowner/business owner and their exterminator. After a building is treated for termites, a bond ensures future inspection and treatment at no cost to the customer beyond the bond renewal fee.\nWill the cost of the bond amount to less than the expected expenses should reinfestation occur?\nDoes the bond cover both inspection and full retreatment?\nWill the bond cover any damages related to termites causing future damage to the house?\nAre you in an area with different kinds of termites? If so, will a bond cover all types of termites returning in the future?\nIf retreatment is needed and the new infestation is more extensive, will the company cover measures beyond the initial service (i.e. if only liquid is used the first time will they cover fumigation in the future)?\nIn order to understand how a termite bond works, you should know the basics of the termite extermination process. The first step is a thorough inspection to determine the type of termite, location of the infestation, and the extent of the damage. All of these factors taken together will determine the method used. Serious infestations usually require fumigation. In fact, a lot of title companies require fumigation before a home with any kind of termite damage is sold to a new owner. Typically, termite fumigations take around three days to complete.\nThe basic termite bond should cover a yearly inspection and, if termites return, future extermination costs. Initial extermination may be as low as $1,500 for a small area and basic treatment, and a large home with a significant problem can cost up to $5,000 to treat. In the first case, a bond fee of $200 per year may not be worth it, especially if you live in an area with infrequent infestations. Wise Geek features a concise article on termite bonds that recommends comparing the annual cost of a bond with the price of re-extermination for your house.\nYou cannot assume a termite bond will cover any and all damages caused by future infestations. Some bonds are for extermination costs only while others promise to repair a limited amount of damages to your house if the termites return within a certain time frame. The kind of termite in your house can affect the bond as well, says Orkin; if the initial treatment was for one type of termite and another kind re-infests your house, the bond may not apply. This may also be the case if the first time you have an issue in your basement, for example, but the next time find termites on the outside of your foundation.\nIf you have questions about termites bonds because you are buying or selling a house, look closely at the bond\u2019s transfer limitations. For buyers purchasing a home with a previous termite problem, make sure the bond can and is transferred to you as the new homeowner. This way you are not on the hook for extermination costs that should have been covered by the previous owner. You will, however, need to take on the responsibility of the bond\u2019s annual fees to continue the contract with the exterminator.\nAs a home seller, you should invest in a bond to increase the chances you will sell a home with termite damages. Homeowners\u2019 insurance does not cover termite damage\u2013 a reinfestation too soon after the sale of your house could leave you paying the new homeowners\u2019 extermination bills. Savvy buyers may not even consider buying from you without a bond in place. With a transferable bond, you can hand off the agreement to the new homeowner, they take on the cost of the bond, and you don\u2019t have to worry about the termites coming back to a home you no longer own.\nIf you\u2019ve recently had your home exterminated for termites and did not arrange for a bond with your pest control company, you may want to contact them and see if you can still sign an agreement. If you are buying or selling a home with previous termite problem and don\u2019t know have never heard of a termite bond before, definitely educate yourself and make a termite bond part of your home buying or selling process. Just make sure the terms are agreeable to you and the needs of your house.\nIn answer to the question, \u201cWhat is a termite bond?\u201d you could say simply it is a contract that guarantees future treatment if termites return. Another way to see it is an added form of insurance that protects the value and condition of your house and other buildings. You will need to decide for yourself if the continuing, nominal cost of a termite bond is worth it; many people who live in areas where termites are a constant problem and go through having to pay for termite extermination once see the value in it.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T23:52:23Z", "url": "https://neverpest.com/what-is-a-termite-bond/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "HOUGHTON \u2014 Whether you\u2019re a survivor, family member, caregiver or neighbor, events like the Day of Hope are important, said cancer survivor Mary Zanoni.\n\u201cCancer is hard, and we need hope,\u201d she said.\nThe American Cancer Society event was held Aug. 18 at the Rozsa Center. This was the second year at the Rozsa, following a dinner program last year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really hoping this event will help build some momentum so that we can get enough people to help plan a Relay (for Life) for next year,\u201d said Ann Collins, community development manager for the ACS.\nThe event honors cancer survivors. The survivors received a T-shirt, pin and flower \u201cto really celebrate their overcoming cancer,\u201d she said.\nThey also told survivors about services offering rides to treatment, or wigs available for people undergoing chemotherapy. The ACS also has Hope lodges, where people traveling for treatment in Minnesota or Wisconsin can stay free of charge.\nSpeaker Mary Zanoni, a survivor of acute myeloid leukemia, spoke about her story. She was diagnosed in 2011, when her doctor noticed something in her blood work after her annual checkup. About 20,000 people a year get it; only 20 percent live for one year.\nAfter shrugging it off, she eventually came down with a severe flu. At the emergency room, the staffer\u2019s eyes went \u201clike that,\u201d Zanoni said, holding her hands out to indicate eyes bulging in disbelief. On that ambulance ride to Marquette, she finally admitted to herself she had cancer.\nThe chemotherpay weakened her immune system. That caused a fungal infection, which doctors quickly caught. She still got fevers, going through a 24-hour cycle of freezing and sweating for two months.\nFamily and friends buoyed her spirits with love, prayers and healing thoughts. She received hundreds of cards and more than 2,000 emails.\nShe received a bone marrow stem cell transplant from two brothers. The brother she didn\u2019t choose came to the hospital in case the other brother didn\u2019t make it.\nZanoni has now been cancer-free for seven years. About a year ago, her doctor told her she was cured.\nAngie Van Tassel, part of the \u201cWomen Living With Cancer\u201d support group, was also on hand to give people information about cancer support groups. The group meets from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. the last Wednesday of the month, alternating between UP Health System \u2014 Portage and Aspirus Keweenaw Hospital.\nSometimes, there will be speakers, such as doctors or dietitians.\n\u201cA lot of the meetings lately, we just go to lunch, and they usually go around the room and have an update and let people talk if they want to share,\u201d she said.\nThe group\u2019s other recent groups include putting together \u201ccancer kits\u201d for patients, and a bake sale at Michigan Tech Federal Credit Union.\nVan Tassel is also part of the Reach for Recovery program, in which she talks with people who have been newly diagnosed with cancer.\nDonna Des-Jardin of Dollar Bay found out about the event on Facebook from Zisone. She would\u2019ve liked to have seen a bigger crowd. Still, it was a good time, she said.\nEvents like the Day of Hope are important ways of giving hope to short-time survivors.

{"text": "** We'll never share your email address and you can opt out at any time, we promise.\nAn interview with Jon \u201cBernie\u201d Bernstein, Director of Digital Marketing, Fifth Story.\nQ. Bernie, can you tell us when and why you would use paid video to build remarketing audiences?\nA. In case you are not familiar with remarketing, it is a way to connect with people who previously interacted with your website or mobile app. It allows you to strategically position or leverage your ads in front of these audiences as they browse Google or its partner websites, thus helping you increase your brand awareness or remind those audiences to make a purchase.\nFor some brands that are trying to find that \u201cneedle in a haystack\u201d audience or an expensive-to-reach audience (like when there is lots of competition and many companies are bidding), using YouTube video pre-roll can help to define and build a remarketing audience in a cost-effective way and narrow down a hard-to-reach target.\nQ. Can you give an example of this?\nA. Sure. For example, if a drywall manufacturer/seller were trying to reach small-to mid-sized contractors and homeowner DIYers, we would run a targeted pre-roll video campaign on YouTube with specific parameters such as demographics, geo-targets, and interests in home, plus add in keywords such as home renovation, home building, etc. We would also run the video pre-roll within content-rich related environments, such as how to install drywall, basement renovations, and other similar content topics that would fit. The pre-roll for the drywall brand would run before the install/reno video content (usually longer-form YouTube content).\nBy selecting this type of target audience and content environment, we can reach an engaged, active audience that is looking to install the product or do similar reno work that could lead to drywall installation at a reasonably low cost per view.\nFor each viewer who watches the pre-roll for 10 seconds or more, we can add them to an audience remarketing list. This helps us develop a targeted list of people who have already shown interest in the product and engaged with the brand. Now we have a more niche marketing list of engaged people that can be reached at a lower cost. This is much more effective than a straight search campaign where you can reach engaged people, but at a high cost. Also, when people click on a remarketing ad, they are more likely to spend a good amount of time on the site since they have some familiarity with the brand/product by watching the video.\nQ. What length of pre-roll would you run to build your remarketing list?\nA. If the video is really informative and it relates to the subject matter of the main video content (what plays after the pre-roll), you can run a longer video. For example, a home building/renovation client ran a video as pre-roll about their home renovation product. The video targeted people who were interested in the renovation category. The average watch time was 1:14 minutes out of a 1:32-minute long video. That is an 86% average video watch time on a video people could have skipped after 6 seconds.\nQ. Do you have any content or creative must-haves for pre-roll video?\nThe other must-have is a call-to-action to click on a website or call (on mobile) to get more information. They may not click if they really wanted to see the video after the pre-roll, but if you have pulled them in enough, you may get them to take action \u2014 if not now, at a later time.\nQ. Can you explain a bit about cross-platform remarketing?\nA. Once you build a remarketing list using YouTube, you can remarket to this audience using YouTube again with additional or sequential video content, or you can remarket to them using Google Display or Search Ads. The purpose of remarketing is to drive a specific audience back to your site to take action.\nIf you set up pixels from other platforms, such as LinkedIn or Facebook, you can also remarket to individuals on these platforms. For example, if you developed a broader remarketing list from YouTube of people who subsequently visited your website from a click on the video or a targeted remarketing ad, that will then trigger the LinkedIn Insight Pixel to fire. With this, you can then narrow the audience on LinkedIn down to profession, job title or association. This dramatically enables B2B marketers to reach very specific targets that are either impossible to get to directly or incredibly costly to reach.\nTo learn more about remarketing, please visit this blog post.\nFifth Story, 5th Story, News Canada, L'edition Nouvelles and News North America are either registered trademarks or trademarks of News Canada Inc.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T04:48:47Z", "url": "https://fifthstory.com/leveraging-paid-video-for-remarketing/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "This fall, Sue O\u2019Malley brought her passion for healthy eating and gardening to Project Place. She is engaging clients in a series of workshops where she teaches nutrition and gardening. She also helps clients identify and access the fresh food resources available to them in Boston. In Sue\u2019s last workshop, clients set up an herb garden on the 6th floor of the Project Place building. They planted chives, basil, lettuce, kale and Swiss chard from seedlings. The plants are currently growing on shelves of planting trays with growing lights. After the plants mature, the herbs will be used in Project Place\u2019s kitchen, where lunch is served daily to clients and staff.\nSue has been involved in urban gardening for a little over ten years now. She started off working on school garden projects, where she came to realize how little the students knew about nutrition. These gardening projects opened her eyes to the disparities that exist in terms of nutrition education and fresh food access. She has since made it her mission to find ways to connect low-income populations with fresh produce. After visiting Project Place, Sue saw a perfect opportunity to get involved and provide additional resources to clients. Sue has donated all the materials used in the herb garden project, and is currently preparing for her next workshop.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T18:25:27Z", "url": "https://projectplace.org/seeds-of-hope/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "On a proper construction of an agreement, which required a supplier of warehouse services to give credit to the user for additional business secured by the supplier in order to utilise spare capacity, the additional business did not include business conducted from an extension to the warehouse.\nThe appellants, a company (S) and a third party, appealed against a decision ((2008) EWCA Civ 1286)) that on a proper construction of an agreement, which required the respondent supplier of warehouse services (W) to give credit to S for additional business secured by W in order to utilise spare capacity, the additional business did not include business conducted from an extension to the warehouse. At one time all three parties had been subsidiaries in the same group. W had constructed a national distribution centre and had entered into an agreement with S to provide warehousing services at the centre to S. Later, W was demerged from the group and the centre became a multi-user site. Under a revised agreement between S and W, S agreed to put a minimum amount of goods through the centre annually, failing which S would be liable to make a volume shortfall payment to W. That payment was to be reduced to the extent that W secured additional third party business. Parts of S's business were then sold and the revised agreement was replaced by new agreements. A side letter provided that W should use reasonable endeavours to develop and secure additional business with a view to utilising spare capacity and throughput in the warehouse. By that time there was an extension to the warehouse at the centre. Unlike the original warehouse, which was a chilled facility and contained automated handling machinery, the extension was only partly chilled and had no automated handling machinery. A dispute arose when the threshold volume of goods under the agreement was not met and W claimed shortfall payments. The issue was whether the reference to the warehouse in the side letter was to the warehouse as originally constructed and not as extended. S contended that to have to distinguish between third party custom in two different parts of an integrated warehouse was uncommercial and unrealistic. S submitted that W had itself regarded all new business wherever it was sited within the extended warehouse as within the concept of additional business.\nFor the purposes of the instant appeal, it was sufficient to consider the third new agreement, the essential structure of which was the same as that of the revised agreement and, as was common ground, it was permissible to construe the new agreement and the side-letter against the background of that revised agreement, HIH Casualty & General Insurance Ltd v New Hampshire Insurance Co (2001) EWCA Civ 735, (2001) 2 All ER (Comm) 39 and Electrosteel Castings Ltd v Scan Trans Shipping & Chartering Sdn Bhd (2002) EWHC 1993 (Comm), (2002) 2 All ER (Comm) 1064 considered. Not only did neither the revised agreement nor the new agreement state that the warehouse services were to be provided in the extension to the warehouse as well as in the original warehouse, whether expressly or impliedly, but both agreements consisted of terms that only made sense on the basis that the services were to be provided only in the original warehouse. In particular, the original warehouse was both chilled and automated, which were requirements of the services to be provided and governed the parameters of those services; the provisions in the agreements repeatedly reflected the size and capacity of the original warehouse; a growth in S's requirements which would put a strain on that capacity would require fresh agreement, and for that purpose the extension and alternative sites were spoken of as pertaining to the same subject matter but that was entirely opposite to the proposition that warehouse included the extension; there were detailed provisions in both agreements for material change in either services or charges without any reference to the extension; and it was further significant that the revised and new agreements addressed the new situation created by the demerger of W and its pursuit of new third party business without reference to the extension. Also, the warehouse was not as integrated as suggested by S. The extension was only partly chilled and not at all automated. Different services suggested different customers. Further, as the judge had suggested, it was uncommercial that S should be entitled to participate, where a volume shortfall occurred, in the profits generated by the extension without any contribution to the cost of the extension, which would be borne entirely by W. Those considerations made a powerful case that the reference to the warehouse in the side letter was to the warehouse as originally constructed and not as extended.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T02:34:29Z", "url": "https://www.maitlandchambers.com/information/recent-cases/st-ivel-ltd-uniq-prepared-foods-ltd-v-wincanton-group-ltd-200", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The Chapel was completed in 1874 under Mother Xavier Maguire's directions and forms part of the old convent. As Archbishop Goold was absent in Rome, the ceremony of Opening and Blessing the chapel was performed by the Rev Dean Fitzpatrick on May 24th 1874.\nThe Chapel is a beautiful example of a 19th century Gothic revival architecture. Built between 1872-1874, it involved a number of architects in it's design. The original drawings were undertaken by John Bourke of Dublin. Major alterations of these drawings were made by William Wardell and sent back to the Mother House in Dublin, by Mother Xavier. Other changes to the plans were made by Mr T. A. Kelly, of Melbourne who was contracted to build the chapel. No evidence is available as to why the redesigning took place. The stonemasons who originally built the chapel were brought out from Ireland. The side chapel was added in 1877, the architect being Alexander Davidson.\nIn 1905 under the guidance of Mother Evangelist Doogan, the sanctuary is beautified and a gothic altar is commissioned by Reid, Smart and Tappin and made by Jaan Kannuluik an Estonian craftsman. After Vatican II, the altar was brought forward so that the priest performing mass could now face the congregation. Sometime after that in 1966 a decision was made to remove the central supporting pillar that divided the main chapel from the boarders' side chapel as the Sisters felt that the pillar obscured the girls' view.\nForty five years later, in 2010 the Chapel was suffering from extensive cracking in the sanctuary walls, which was always thought to have been caused by drought. When a gang of cockatoos moved into the slate roof and started to destroy it, structural engineers were called in and it was found that the structure had been put at risk by the pillar's removal. For two years the chapel was closed while the pillar was reinstated, the slate roof replaced and the interior, including the highly decorative paint work was completely restored.\nThe 128 year old George Fincham organ, has recently had a facelift, with the pipe facade being painted and gilded in a beautiful gothic design by Mulholland Restoration and decorating.\nThe organ was presented to Mother Regis Manly, the director of music in the chapel, by Mother Mary Gabriel Sherlock in 1886. Fincham\u2019s two-manual and pedal organ has a french console disposition with the player\u2019s back to the pipe facade, which is set in gothic wood panelling. The whole instrument is set in a west-end gallery with a projecting balustrade for the console.\nThe organ was refurbished for it\u2019s 100th birthday by George Fincham and Sons, descendants of the original George Fincham, who have maintained the organ since it\u2019s installation and continue its care.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T00:17:44Z", "url": "http://www.archivesatheart.com/archives/the-chapel-inside", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The return of Morning Style!\nMany of you have been asking me whether my regular fashion show, Morning Style, will be returning to QVC. The good news is YES!\nWednesday 1st July is the day, in its usual slot at 10am. It will continue right though the summer until the end of September; I\u2019m really looking forward to bringing you a selection of outfits from a variety of brands and helping you get the best out of QVC fashion again.\nOne thing that is important, whatever your style, is getting the basics right. That can mean choosing underwear that helps rather than hinders the finished look. There\u2019s a reason the old fashioned term for these clothes is foundation garments \u2013 get it wrong and your entire look can be undermined, but with the right shape wear underneath you can look better than ever.\nChoosing shapewear is notoriously difficult \u2013 getting the correct size, shape and style can sometimes seem little better than guesswork, so we\u2019ve decided to bring you a new show to help you make the right decisions.\nYour Figure Solutions will be launched on Wednesday 27th May at midday. Not all the clothes are underwear as we\u2019ll be featuring a variety of pieces. The show will feature innovative solutions to some of your swimwear problems, leggings that smooth and sculpt, and possibly the most comfortable bra ever!\nIf you\u2019re thinking about a holiday you have planned, and how you don\u2019t feel quite as confident as you\u2019d like by the pool or on the beach, you should tune in to hear about how Fit 4 u\u2019s swimwear deals with body concern areas \u2013 usually bust, tummy, hips, bottom or thighs \u2013 or all of the above!! An empire-line swim dress is one of the piece that\u2019ll be featuring.\nRhonda Shear\u2019s Ahh Bra will also feature \u2013 a fabulous pack of six in three neutral colours for under \u00a350. It has great reviews on our website.\nA name you may have heard as they\u2019ve been with QVC for years is Slim \u2018n Lift. They make some great control wear that can help you lose inches from your chosen area. It\u2019s a temporary loss, of course, but what I always find amazing is that the extra flesh doesn\u2019t pop out anywhere else \u2013 it seems to be compressed by the garment, rather than just squeezed elsewhere, which gives the bonus of feeling firmer too. But it\u2019s not just about underwear \u2013 we also have a funky pair of shaping leggings in snake or animal print which I\u2019m hoping to wear on the day, but you\u2019ll need to tune in to see them.\nWe will be kicking off the show with a relatively new name to QVC and that\u2019s skinnytees. This is a classic vest top that feels fantastic to wear. It\u2019s made from a soft stretchy fabric and is seamless and long enough to wear over leggings. When I took part in the charity Moonwalk with TeamQVC last weekend I wore it under my decorated bra (they prefer us to wear just the bra but my tummy is not fit for public viewing!) and it was the prefect choice. Comfy and with a smoothing effect too. Here\u2019s a photo of us all before we started the walk.\nI think controlwear or shapewear can be tricky to get right. It can be uncomfortable, ride up or down, make you feel too hot or simply not do the job you want. You can choose a high level of control or something that just smooths your silhouette; something to hide under your outer garments or to show off as part of your outfit. There\u2019s so much choice, where to start?\nIf you have any questions or concerns about what sort of shapewear is right for you and your particular issue or aim, do please drop me a quick line as a comment below or on Twitter (@kathytaylerqvc). I will be welcoming several guests to the new show and I will put your questions or problems to them and hopefully they will have some answers for you that may help many of us.\nI do hope you can join us \u2013 midday on Wednesday 27th May. See you then!\nGreat to see the Morning Style show is coming back!! Looking forward to the shapewear shows, as you say get the underwear right and the outfit wil look great too. I love the spanx range and also vicela Vita.\nI will be tuning in for both morning style and the shapewear show!I Find shapewear shopping tricky. I what something that will smooth out my lumps and bumps but but I don\u2019t want to feel uncomfortable after half an hour ! Any suggestions Kathy!\nHi Jilly. Good to hear from you. We won\u2019t be featuring Vercella Vita or Spanx in tomorrow\u2019s show but I think you might like some of what we have lined up. Hope you can join us!\nHi Susan. How are you?! Thanks for the youthful comment \u2013 I certainly didn\u2019t feel it at the end of the might, but the hat helped keep me warm!\nThanks for your comment. I agree with you \u2013 I can be desperate to get out of some control wear however good it makes me look. We will be address the balance between compression, smoothing and comfort tomorrow so I do hope you\u2019ll join is. Hopefully we can help you choose something suitable for you.\nGood news re Morning Style!\nThe skinny tees are brilliant. I have them in all the colours including the new 4! What I really love about them is that stop trousers etc that are a little loose slipping. They are much more comfortable than wearing a belt! Can we please have more of the dark colours \u2013 I love them all but the white ones are pretty unforgiving with nothing else on even if you are slim! But the dark ones are extra good.\nAlso, more of the vercella vita crop tops. There must be a really strong demand as they always sell out within minutes of going to air, and they are rarely put up before the show ( presumably as they would sell out too quickly!) There are loads of longer vest tops but no crop tops online almost all the time. Doesn\u2019t that say that you need to get more of them!! Especially in the summer.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T15:43:01Z", "url": "https://blogs.qvcuk.com/the-return-of-morning-style/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Linda McCluskey\u2019s scrapbook of memories is forged from oil paint and brush strokes.\nMany of the images are familiar \u2014 Middle Street, The Worthen, downtown canalways \u2014 places you might have passed a thousand times. But when McCluskey reimagines them on canvas, the familiar begins to stir.\nBrick and mortar. Cobblestones and canals. All bend, curve, twist and turn. You can almost hear the music. Feel the energy. It\u2019s an invitation to step inside McCluskey\u2019s world, where cityscapes seem to breathe.\nLowell, after all, is where she found inspiration to pick up a paintbrush again at age 40. Her success as a full-time working artist in Paris is proof, she says, that it\u2019s never too late to pursue a dream.\nSlogging along the daily grind, McCluskey\u2019s art supplies ended up in boxes in a basement. She carried old photos of her favorite works with her as a reminder from time to time of who she was before becoming a mom, a wife and a cubicle dweller.\nSometimes life holds up a mirror and forces you to take a long hard look. Maybe it was the milestone, but McCluskey recalls her 40th birthday jogging something awake inside her.\nAnd just like that, she put her dreams in action. With her kids Jake and Carly all grown up, she enrolled in college courses at UMass Lowell. Back at school, she travelled to France for a painting workshop and fell in love with her life all over again.\nShe was the happiest she had been in a long time, then tragedy struck. Her partner of six years, Ed McCabe, was killed in a motorcycle accident in 2001.\n\u201cI felt like my life was over,\u201d McCluskey admits.\nBut in the shadow of her grief, she managed to find a sliver of light.\nA close friend told her not to focus on the long and rolling highway. Follow the little paths life offers up instead. With nothing left to lose, McCluskey moved to France in January 2002. She was 44.\nPicking up her brushes and paint again, she was reborn. Enter Linda McCluskey, the artist. Paris gave her freedom to rediscover and reinvent herself.\n\u201cIn Paris, if you say you\u2019re a painter, people don\u2019t ask, \u2018what do you really do?\u2019 \u201d she explains.\nIn 2004, a move into a 6th floor studio overlooking St. Germaine Boulevard gave her a new perspective. Being a \u201ccountry girl\u201d born and raised in Chelmsford, she had never lived up so high.\nThe scenes unfolding on her canvas were well painted but still focused on proper form, until a trip to surrealist painter Salvador Dali\u2019s beloved village of Cadaques in Spain pushed her brush in a whole new direction.\nThe natural beauty of Cadaques inspired Dali and the way he interpreted that on canvas brought attention to the region. Taking in the breathtaking view from a hillside, McCluskey did a Dali-esque painting of the village and the church melting over the mountains.\n\u201cAfter painting traditional views for so long, this felt like freedom to play and make up the impossible,\u201d she says.\nIt was the beginning of McCluskey\u2019s imaginative \u201cdistortion\u201d pieces, and she gained recognition as a unique artist in Paris and in Lowell.\nShe returns to Lowell each year for inspiration.\nWhere Middle and Palmer streets intersect.\nShe points to her painting of Lowell\u2019s Middle Street, one of her favorite downtown spots.\nToday she has her own studio at Paris\u2019 59 Rivoli \u2014 one of the top three visited galleries in France \u2014 where she was accepted for a permanent residency.

{"text": "Chances are if you\u2019ve been affected by cybercrime in the past year, you\u2019ve been the victim of a banking trojan. Proofpoint\u2019s latest quarterly threat report notes that over half of all successful email-based attacks were propagated by banking trojans (meanwhile ransomware, once one of the greatest threats to enterprises, came in at a mere .1% of total attacks).\nThis is no coincidence. Unlike the obtrusiveness of most ransomware attacks, where the attacker makes money by getting the victim to pay for the return of their files, a banking trojan is much more pernicious: infected hosts contribute to identity theft by quietly siphoning off sensitive information and login credentials, all the while using the host\u2019s computing power to mine cryptocurrencies and send out spam emails in the background.\nA look at Emotet, one of the most prominent banking trojan from the past 18 months, gives insight into the advanced and destructive nature that these attacks can wreak upon an organization.\nEmotet, also known as Geodo, has been around for almost five years and started off primarily self-distributed through attempts at brute-forcing user accounts. Attackers would attempt easily-guessable passwords and those found from compromised sites that were sold or published on the darkweb. Instituting password requirements, password rotation, and password lock outs were enough to thwart most initial Emotet iterations. Recently, however, it has gained and maintained relevance by switching to phishing campaigns that use enticing emails and malicious payloads that resist detection and analysis.\nAn attack usually starts by a victim receiving an email from either a spoofed sender address or a compromised legitimate account. The email and link/attachment are usually themed as something the user would want to click on due to its urgent (invoices, shipping notifications) or contextual (tax season, holiday season) nature. Recent iterations of these malspam emails have a malicious link or macro-enabled Word document which launch when clicked upon, in turn running a PowerShell script that either downloads or runs an already-downloaded malicious payload.\nEmotet is largely resistant to signature-based detection because it is polymorphic, meaning it will change its code in slight but meaningful ways every time it is downloaded. Attackers will routinely change the IP addresses and domains that the links and attachments will reach out to, further evading detection solutions. It can also frustrate analysts looking to study the malware because if it senses that it\u2019s in a virtual machine, it won\u2019t download or execute its payload like it would in a normal environment.\n1. A spoofed email attempts to convince a user that their tax return transcript was emailed by the IRS, encouraging them to click on a malicious, macro-enabled Word document which would download the Emotet payload.\nEmotet is also modular in nature, meaning attackers are able to customize the payload and specify their malware campaign to fit their particular goals. While it primarily delivers trojans that scrape credentials and mine Monero (a cryptocurrency that obscures the source, amount, and destination of its transaction), it\u2019s able to release a host of other attacks into an organization\u2019s network, including ransomware. Once a system is compromised, however, most variations will look to establish persistence on the machine its currently on and spread to more machines by using captured credentials and send out more malicious emails via the victim\u2019s email accounts.\nAn organization affected by a banking trojan like Emotet could have their sensitive or proprietary information stolen or altered and could witness a disruption to their productivity, files, and reputation. In some cases the cost for the remediation of an incident caused by Emotet costs upwards of $1 million (according to https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-201A and https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/allentown-struggles-with-1-million/).\nPurple Teams: Test yourself and inspect what you expect. Conducting a purple team campaign focused on the TTP\u2019s that the Emotet campaigns use you\u2019ll be able to create a defensive playbook to implement.\nEmail Defense: Help users discern a malicious email from a legitimate one by enabling DMARC and rules to mark external emails, which let your users know when an email is masquerading as an internal email. Security Risk Advisors encourages organizations to utilize an email defense platform that monitors and quarantines malicious emails at the gateway before a user ever sees that email.\nLimit Macro Functionality: If a user clicks on an attachment and opens it, Emotet will attempt to run macros or PowerShell scripts to download payloads and establish persistence. By disabling auto-enabled macros and PowerShell for users that don\u2019t need PowerShell, you limit the ability for an attacker to compromise a user\u2019s endpoint via malicious attachment.\nLSA Protection and Credential Guard: An attacker is going to want to escalate their privileges by gaining new credentials, oftentimes succeeding by dumping cleartext or hashed credentials stored in memory or a suspended VM. On Windows machines, you can prevent some of these credential attacks by enabling LSA Protection as well as Credential Guard within Windows 10. Both of these protections look to isolate credential processes that attackers love to exploit. While not bulletproof, both help to mitigate common credential dumping techniques.\nMonitor, Alert and Hunt: Emotet will attempt to maintain persistence by creating other services and scheduled tasks that a user would never notice. Utilize built-in Windows functionality or a third-party application to monitor for scheduled task or service creation. Conduct threat hunting exercises on the network looking for previously compromised systems.\nQuarantine and Investigate: Do your best to quarantine infected hosts from the rest of your network. Perform an investigation upon how the payload propagated and determine what variant it is. Depending on the variant, a simple restart after removing the malicious files could be enough to re-image the endpoint; others will require more serious changes, like backup restoration and the removal of current registry keys, startup items, or services. Security Risk Advisors recommends an EDR solution that will quarantine devices immediately upon detection of a malware infection.\nDetermine Blast Radius: Using your initial investigation, identify other hosts with similar activity and perform recovery upon those endpoints as well. Determining the vector of attack and the methods through which the attack propagated could reveal vulnerabilities in your architecture.\nReset Credentials: After devices have been successfully segmented and reimaged, make sure to reset accounts passwords for the hosts and applications that have been compromised. Don\u2019t authenticate to infected systems with domain or shared local administrator credentials, as you could allow an attacker to gain further footholds in your network.\nImplement Additional Monitoring: Continue to closely monitor those endpoints and your network as a whole for indicators of compromise gathered from your investigation and quarantining. Block those suspicious IP and domain addresses, hashes, macros, and filepaths that were found to execute during the attack. Seeing these still in your environment will be an indicator that a new infection has occurred or the old infection persists.\nEmotet isn\u2019t going away, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to fear it. By practicing common sense principles regarding email and web use, a phishing campaign can be stopped before a banking trojan reaches your network.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T01:02:27Z", "url": "https://securityriskadvisors.com/blog/the-perniciousness-of-emotet-and-banking-trojans/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "How long does it take the flu to evade a vaccine?\nWith all the recent Presidential attention to the threat from the H5N1 Avian Flu, and the many billions now earmarked for stockpiling vaccines and drugs, it seems like a good idea to ask on what time scale the virus might be able to evade these countermeasures. Vaccination is of particular interest, as it is regarded as by far the best tool to combat viral infection at the population level.\nGenomic analyses of H5N1 isolates from birds and humans showed 2 distinct clades with a nonoverlapping geographic distribution. All the viral genes were of avian influenza origin, which indicates absence of reassortment with human influenza viruses.\nGenetic and antigenic analyses have shown that, compared to previous H5N1 isolates, 2004-2005 isolates share several amino acid changes that modulate antigenicity and perhaps other biological function. Furthermore, our molecular analysis of the HA from isolates collected in 2005 suggests that several amino acids located near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which may affect antigenicity or transmisibility.\nDespite the recent \"Isolation of drug-resistant H5N1 virus,\" (Nature, 20 October 2005), the WHO Global Influenza team determined that recent isolates are \"sensitive to 2 neuraminidase inhibitors that are recommended for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention against human infections.\" So obviously the specific details of which viral isolate one is working with determine its sensitivity to drugs. In the case of the drug-resistant strain, it was isolated in February 2005 from a Vietnamese girl who may have contracted the virus while she cared for her brother. Human-to-human transmission is supported by the girl's lack of contact with poultry and the fact that the neuraminidase gene from virus isolated from the girl was virtually identical to that isolated from her brother. Thus there are evidently drug resistant strains running around in the wild.\nAs far as I can tell, it just isn't yet clear how fast drug-resistance traits can spread. There is now at least a little data about how long it takes a particular viral strain to find work-arounds for vaccines. A recent initial effort to sequence many flu strains in parallel indicates that mutations that provide ways around vaccines can rapidly dominate a population of flu viruses.\nPerhaps the most dramatic finding in our data is the discovery of an epidemiologically significant reassortment that explains the appearance, during the 2003-2004 season, of the 'Fujian/411/2002'-like strain, for which the existing vaccine had limited effectiveness. ...Phylogenetic analysis of 156 H3N2 genomes from our project revealed the clear presence of multiple, distinct clades circulating in the population. Through a reassortment event, a minor clade provided the haemagglutinin gene that later became part of the dominant strain after the 2002-2003 season.\nThis finding illustrates not only that the influenza virus population contains multiple lineages at any given time, but also that alternate, minor lineages can contribute genetic variation to the dominant lineage, resulting in epidemiologically significant, antigenically novel strains. It is worth emphasizing that our sequence-based sampling approach--in contrast to traditional serologically based sampling--will reveal co-circulating strains even before they become antigenically novel.\nIn other words, the authors assert that amongst viruses that we give the same name there is considerable variation that may be hard to distinguish using traditional techniques. Sequencing the genomes of many isolates can provide a map of how a population of viruses is changing in response to vaccines. Ghedin, et al., note that their work demonstrates significant change of the dominant flu strain even within the 2003-2004 flu season. That variation appeared to originate and then dominate the population of viruses within 12 months.\nWhich brings me to the core of this post, namely that we now have real-world data demonstrating that flu viruses can escape vaccines in less than a year, far shorter than the time it takes to produce significant quantities of effective vaccines. It is important to note that this is a different problem than producing a new vaccine for new annual flu strains every year. If a pandemic strain emerges, our problem is not planning ahead just far enough to deploy a vaccine for next year's strain, but rather to combat a strain already killing people worldwide. It took most of a year for the CDC and Sanofi to come up with a hypothetical H5N1 vaccine, and the new National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza contains the expectation of years to accumulate enough vaccine to be useful for large populations. Never mind that the existing whole virus vaccine may not be effective against a pandemic strain.\nThe fact that the minor Fujian-like clade has donated its HA to the previously dominant strain rather than itself becoming the dominant circulating virus indicates that there may be important amino acid co-substitutions in the other proteins essential for viral fitness.\n...Even within a geographically constrained set of isolates, we have found surprising genetic diversity, indicating that the reservoir of influenza A strains in the human population -- and the concomitant potential for segment exchange between strains -- may be greater than was previously suspected.\nWe cannot think of the H5N1, or any other strain, as either a clonal population experiencing selection or as a bunch of individuals producing descendants that may accumulate mutations leading to a pandemic strain. Rather, flu viruses exists as elements of a population that appear to be constantly innovating and trading parts. This is a critical distinction, particularly in light of rapid human and avian intercontinental travel. Not only have we now learned that there is greater variation in any given set of geographically linked isolates, but because of human travel we can expect all kinds of novel parts to show up in populations that were otherwise isolated and appeared to be of no immediate threat.\nThe Ghedin paper doesn't necessarily teach us directly about the evolution of pandemic flu strains, but it does suggest our current plan for pandemic vaccination is not well suited for the problem at hand.\nAfter studying synthetic vaccines for Bio-ERA, amongst other clients, I think DNA vaccines are the best bet for rapid response on a time scale shorter than flu strains seem to evolve. I've a draft paper on synthetic vaccines in for consideration at Biosecurity and Bioterrorism, and will shortly embark on another paper specifically about distributed manufacture of DNA vaccines. PowderMed is waiting for publication of their (already accepted) first paper on their plasmid vaccine for the annual flu and will be starting trials of an H5N1 DNA vaccine early next year. Unfortunately, it seems the folks in DC aren't taking this technology seriously, and instead blowing billions on developing cell culture production of whole virus vaccines. Even the folks who manufacture vaccines in cell culture acknowledge this will only cut a month or two off the response time.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T07:14:27Z", "url": "http://www.synthesis.cc/synthesis/2005/11/how_long_does_it_take_the_flu_to_evade_a_vaccine", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

It is perhaps surprising , however, to find that the belief in a nonexistence of a Supreme Being is also considered to be a (nontheistic) religion. Thus, atheism was formally declared to be a religion by the United States Supreme Court in 1961, together with Buddhism, Ethical Culture, Secular Humanism, and others that do not teach a belief in the existence of God (Bird 1979).

So legitimate email from ICIWorld can be trapped in your SPAM FOLDER. Yet each EMail contains information for contacts for potential real estate transactions. The spam folder is is different from junk. Look for a column of folders one called \u201cmore.\u201d You will find a spam folder there. You can put a check mark on the listing and click on Not Spam. If you have not done this before, you will probably find other mail that should not be spam. However marking mail as not spam does not seem to work all the time. Mail seems to continue to go to spam.

{"text": "Hi my name is Dan Shipper I\u2019m a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania and over the past 7 months I\u2019ve been covered in TechCrunch (here), Mashable (here), TheNextWeb (here) and others for projects I\u2019ve built both as a solo developer and with a team of my friends.\nThe absolute best way to get coverage from any media outlet is to know someone who works there, or know someone who knows someone who works there. Journalists, especially tech journalists, get pitched every single day by hundreds of people. Their inboxes are overflowing with emails talking about \u201camazing,\u201d \u201cworld-changing,\u201d \u201clife-altering\u201d startups. That means that your absolute best chance to get coverage for your project is to email everyone you know and ask them if they know anyone who writes for a big blog. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask \u2013 the worst anyone can say is no.\nIf you don\u2019t know anyone who knows anyone that writes for a tech site, don\u2019t worry. Compile a list of every tech site you can think of, write a pitch and email all of them. The chances of success are low, but you may get lucky. This is how we got covered in Mashable. If you have a product with traction, excited users, funding, or a really good story you\u2019ve just beaten out 90% of the other cold emails that these blogs get. The most important part is showing in your email that you have a great story to tell that would appeal to the blog\u2019s audience. And keep it short \u2013 generally your emails won\u2019t be read past the first few sentences.\nWe got on TechCrunch by creating a Twitter account called YC Y U NO and making fun of a bunch of YC startups. Seriously. Now, we had no idea when we did it at first that it would lead to getting on TechCrunch. We did it on a whim just for fun. But for some reason people really seemed to like the tweets we were coming up with, a bunch of YC founders started following us as well as a few TechCrunch writers. From there we DMed one of them and they agreed to write a story about us and our new project.\nGet the names of some writers that you admire, or think would be interested in covering you and see if you have any LinkedIn or Facebook connections. I know a lot of people who use this as a first step in getting coverage. You might be surprised at how many connections you have that you didn\u2019t know about.\nA journalist isn\u2019t going to risk their reputation or their site\u2019s reputation covering an app, or startup that doesn\u2019t have amazing design. If anything is even a little bit off with how your site looks, if it doesn\u2019t look professional and current, they won\u2019t cover you. The design doesn\u2019t even have to be complex. My design for WhereMyFriends.Be which was covered on Mashable was actually really minimalist. But it has to inspire enough confidence from the writer to go out on a limb for.\nI think the most important thing to realize is that it\u2019s not some insurmountable feat to get coverage. Tech sites are run by real people too, and if you show them that you have a great story, and a great product your chances of success increase exponentially. Persistence doesn\u2019t hurt either.\nThat being said, don\u2019t pin your hopes on coverage. It\u2019s a huge rush to get it, but the road to success doesn\u2019t always start with TechCrunch and in fact often doesn\u2019t.\nA few days ago I put together a small app in Rails called DomainPolish. When I was finished with it I posted it to Hacker News. It made the bottom part of the front page for a little while \u2013 at one point there were as many as 30 people concurrently on the site. I waited for the sales to roll in.\nNone came that Friday night. On Saturday too, there was a fair amount of traffic coming onto the site but, still, no sales. Then Sunday came. It was about 4 in the afternoon and I was thinking about what kind of project I wanted to work on next. The first sale came in. I went nuts. Then another sale came in and I was happy as can be. I had set a goal for myself to make $5 that weekend and I had fulfilled it. And then the person who made the second sale emailed me. He wanted to write a blog post about the service. I said \u201cSure!\u201d and waited to hear what he had to say.\nWell the blog post came out in about an hour, and he loved the service! I was so happy. And then he submitted it to Hacker News. Suddenly I was getting emails left and right saying that I had made sales as it climbed the front page. By the end of the night the blog post had referred 1500 people. I had sold 32 plans. That\u2019s cool. But what was even more cool was to look at how that conversion rate changed (and ultimately number of products sold went down) when I had far more traffic but without social proof.\nTwo days after the blog post I decided to write an account of my experience creating the site. After I wrote it I posted it to Hacker News. Soon the visitors were pouring in, and it stayed as the number one story for at least a few hours. By the end of the night my blog post had referred almost 3000 people \u2013 49% more visitors coming to the site from my blog post, than from the blog post written by someone else. But the number of products sold from a blog post written by me was actually 50% lower than the number of products sold from a blog post written by someone else. When someone wrote about me I sold 32 plans. When I wrote about myself I sold 15 plans.\nWhat does this say? Social proof matters. Your traffic will convert better if there\u2019s someone credible on the other end saying they love your product. Ad campaigns and blogging about yourself are very valuable tools, but in the end they can\u2019t compete with the power of social proof.\nHi my name is Dan Shipper and I\u2019m a rising sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania. This is the story of how I created DomainPolish a site to get on-demand, inexpensive focus groups to review your website and ended up making $350 with it in two days.\nIt all started when we found out we had made it to the TechStars NY Wildcard Round. The way the TechStars Wildcard works is they take 10 teams who they really liked, but whose idea they weren\u2019t fond of, and give them a week to come up with a new idea with the understanding that at least one of the teams will make it into the program. While we were deciding which idea we wanted to pitch to TechStars, my teammate Jesse Beyroutey (fantastic blog here) started using Amazon Mechanical Turk to get feedback about them. He would post a short description of the idea, and then ask the turks (as they\u2019re called) to give us their thoughts. I was surprised at some the high quality comments we got, and I was fascinated by the power of the concept. There are a lot of awesome things you can do with a distributed, on-demand workforce of people gathered over the internet.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T04:44:18Z", "url": "http://danshipper.com/2011/08", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "As much as teachers do all that they can to make their classrooms a place of comfort and security, for some students the school environment can be a stressful one. For a whole gamut of reasons, at some stage during their time spent at school, most kids experience some kind of school-related anxiety. Whether it be separation anxiety in the early years, anxiety about testing and assessment or social anxiety, the reasons are many but the negative effects often the same. Teaching mindfulness is one way that educators and parents alike can help to build the coping skills kids need when they are faced with challenging situations and environments.\nMindfulness is the practice of paying attention, on purpose, to the present moment (Grossman, 2016). It\u2019s something that came so naturally to us as small children, when we could easily spend time silently mesmerised by a single ant wandering across the ground. Though it\u2019s true that as we get older, as our understanding of the world grows wider and our minds subsequently busier, that time spent in silent wonderment doesn\u2019t happen quite so easily.\nTeaching children the conscious skill of mindfulness is an empowering one. The ability to stop, to centre ourselves, to notice what is happening in any given moment goes a long way towards self-regulation and self-awareness. For children who experience anxiety, whether situational or prolonged, having simple and familiar thoughts or actions to call upon during times of stress become important, lifelong skills.\nMindfulness is a superpower that everyone can have. To activate this superpower we only need two things, our mind and our breath. It is for this reason, and so many more, that teaching mindfulness to children is something that should be on every teacher, parent and carers\u2019 radar.\nWith that in mind, here are some fun and simple ways to introduce the concept of mindfulness to young children.\nThis simple activity is a way to teach your child about \u201cbelly breathing\u201d. Centering our thoughts and emotions through our breath is a wonderful self-regulation skill for everyone to learn.\nLay down on the floor beside your child and place a small soft toy, like the little wuppy\u00ae, or any other light-weight object such as a small bean bag or wooden block onto your belly buttons.\nWith your child, lay still and watch the toy move up and down as you both breathe in and out.\nTalk with your child about what you notice. About how quickly or slowly the toy moves.\nYou can also count as your child breathes in \u201c1, 2, 3\u201d and breathes out \u201c1, 2, 3\u201d.\nAnother beautiful child-friendly reframing of a traditional mindfulness practice is to go on a Mindful Safari.\nTake your child outside into nature and tell them that you are both going to go exploring. That you need to discover what creatures, plants and other natural objects are close by.\nTell your child to turn their sense of sight, touch and sound onto high. Remind them that they need to be so, so quiet that they can move around without scaring any little creatures away.\nWhen you find a creature or beautiful object, pause and look at it closely for a while.\nSignal to your child to remain quiet, putting your finger to your lips. They will love the adventure!\nAfter some time spent observing in silence, quietly ask your child some questions.\nThe free Nature Scavenger Hunt Grid on the Teach Starter website can make your Mindful Safari a fun one.\nGuided meditations are a great way to familiarise kids with the language of mindfulness and meditation. There are a number of fantastic apps with free guided meditations. Smiling Minds has great meditations for both children and adults, while Insight Timer is a fantastic free app for adults.\nA \u201cBreathing Colours\u201d guided meditation introduces a simple visualisation to help children focus on using their breath for relaxation.\nAsk your child to think of a relaxing colour. It can be any colour they like, as long as it is one that makes them think of relaxation.\nThen ask them to think of a colour that represents stress, sadness or anger. Whichever of those emotions is most relevant or suitable for your child group to explore.\nWith your spoken guidance, your child imagines breathing in the relaxing colour and visualises it filling their lungs.\nThen they imagine breathing out the stress, sadness or anger colour.\nThere are many ways to teach mindfulness to children. Ultimately, any time that you spend with your child consciously slowing down, and bringing awareness to the moment, will help to build their own repertoire of self-awareness and emotional regulation skills.\nCassie Nguyen is a former school teacher and fellow anxiety-conqueror.

{"text": "Eastern Lightning (\u4e1c\u65b9\u95ea\u7535) or the Church of Almighty God is a Chinese cult based on Christianity who believe that Jesus Christ has been reincarnated as Yang Xiangbing (1973\u2013), a Chinese woman. It was founded in 1989 by Zhao Weishan (\u8d75\u7ef4\u5c71) (1951\u2013), who currently resides in the United States where he continues to lead the church. The name Eastern Lightning is derived from Matthew 24:27.\nAs the Second Coming of Jesus, Yang Xiangbing will guide mankind through the end times. Eastern Lightning preaches salvation through her third testament, The Word Appears in the Flesh. Eastern Lightning refers to the Chinese Communist Party as the \"Great Red Dragon\" of the Book of Revelation, and some members predicted that the world would end on December 21, 2012. The leaders of group, however, rejected that prediction.\nThe group's theology divides time into three ages: that of the law (the Old Testament), that of grace (the New Testament), and that of Kingdom (the current age). It teaches that the \"Age of Grace\" has been superseded by the \"Age of Kingdom\", during which humans will not only be forgiven of their sins, but also cleansed of their sinful nature. There is also a separate \"Age of the Millennial Kingdom\", which is supposed to occur after God's work in China has ended; during that age, the apocalyptic events in the Book of Revelation are to occur.\nThe sect essentially excludes mainstream Christians who are not part of the group from salvation, stating that those who hold on to conventional Christian beliefs are \"guilty of opposing God\" and do not truly believe in Him.\nThe group implicitly denies absolute Biblical inerrancy and explicitly denies the notion that the Bible provides a sufficient understanding of God, condemning such views as Bibliolatry that restricts God via the Bible. Videos on the group's channel render quotations of Jesus in yellow, similar to Red Letter Christians, but also render the group's own The Word Appears in the Flesh in yellow captions to emphasize their belief that the piece of literature is from God rather than a cult leader. The group's view of the Bible as limited and fallible is, however, likely not rooted in rational skepticism of religious dogma and should not be confounded with efforts by progressive Christians to re-interpret the Bible to suit modern science and values. Rather, this is likely intended to prop up the group's theology despite its contradictions with the Bible. For example, the name of the group is, ironically, quote mined right out of a passage about false [[prophets[[ and teachers in Matthew 24:22 that appears to imply that groups like it are following false messiahs.\nDespite believing that all Christians following mainstream beliefs are going to Hell forever, videos on the sect's channel frequently identify the group's members as simply \"Christians\" or \"people who believe in God\". The group also denies evolution.\nLike other Chinese New Age groups such as Falun Gong, the Chinese government considers Eastern Lightning to be a cult and has outlawed the group.\nHowever, unlike Falun Gong, Eastern Lightning has been accused of explicitly engaging in acts of violence. For instance, in 2002 Eastern Lightning allegedly kidnapped 34 members of a Chinese house church network, the China Gospel Fellowship, for two months by pretending to be a Christian training center. According to a victim of the kidnapping, the cultists initially claimed to be theologians from Singapore but later revealed they were actually members of Eastern Lightning; after the victim rebuked them for heresy (cult members had allegedly beaten four Christians in his hometown and left them disfigured), he was called a \"Pharisee\" and moved to a locked room in a residence where he was subjected to verbal abuse. The victim was left pale and emaciated.\nIn a more widely publicized event in 2014, cultists identifying as believers in \"Almighty God\" beat a woman to death at a local McDonald's for simply refusing to give them her phone number. The sect tried to distance itself from the murderers, noting that the suspects testified that they had never come into contact with the church; the sect further accused the Communist Party of being behind the attack. A close look at the testimony shows that the murderers may have been influenced by some of the literature produced by the sect but did not consider the sect to be the true representatives of \"Almighty God\" (Splitters!).\nThe sect produces slick, high-budget \"Christian\" films and uploads them to YouTube. In those movies, all characters, good or bad, invariably use Apple products. Why they have such an obsession with Macs and iPhones remains unexplained.\n\u2191 3.0 3.1 \"Church of Almighty God\".

It appears Feiglin is on his way back to the Knesset, while Tibi just sank below the threshold minimum vote.\nAn Israel Hayom poll published Friday morning shows former IDF chief of staff with 19 seats, the Likud down from 30 to 28, the Labor Party falling to its lowest point so far \u20135 seats, Yair Lapid\u2019s Yesh Atid stuck in the mud with 9 seats (down from its current 11, which is down from its previous Knesset list of 19), and, for the first time in this campaign, the Zehut (Identity) party, headed by former Likud MK Moshe Feiglin who is a regular pundit at Jewish Press Online, crossing the electoral threshold with 4 seats.\nThe numerous splits of the past few months, on the left and on the right\u2014some of which may end up merging by the official deadline set by the Central Elections Committee, have led to many parties that are swinging just above or just below the: Gesher, headed by Orly Levy-Abekasis, receives 4 seats, while Shas, Meretz, Habayit Hayehudi receive only 3.\nHere\u2019s another doozie: Both Avigdor Liberman and his nemesis Ahmad Tibi get only 3 seats and walk into the setting sun, probably not hand in hand.\nAnd like we said, Zehut, headed by Cool Hand Feiglin, which just held the first open primaries in Israel ever on Tuesday, and did it online (you gave them your ID number and cell number, they SMSed you a code, you clicked in and got to spread 6 points among the candidate/s of your choice) is also on the verge of the electoral threshold \u2013 but for the first time looking at the abyss from above, with 4 seats.\nParties that are so far from the threshold they\u2019re already in Party Heaven (doesn\u2019t that sound like the place you\u2019d want to go when the time comes) are Tzipi Livni and Eli Yishai, each of whom receives but one mandate.\nThe survey examined a scenario according to which Gantz and Lapid unite and bring in former Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi. The result: they all get 32 \u200b\u200bmandates, with the Likud pushed to second place with 30, while Labor falls into the 3.25% abyss and goes to pole paradise with a measly 3 seats (down from 24).\nImmediately after Ganz\u2019s speech, the Likud and New Right tried to associate Ganz with the left, while Resilient to Israel, Gantz\u2019s party, what a name) insisted that theirs is a centrist party. Well, the poll showed that 25% of respondents still do not know how to define him.\nAfter the pollsters removed the \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d results, 52% of the rest located Gantz at the center, 19% see him as a right-winger, and 29% as left-winger.\nFinal surprise: on the issue of who is more suitable to be the next prime minister, Netanyahu leads safely with 38%, while Gantz gets only 22%.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T04:48:16Z", "url": "https://www.jewishpress.com/news/israel/religious-secular-in-israel-israel/this-just-in-feiglin-passes-threshold/2019/02/01/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Why is it important to learn horsemanship besides learning to ride? Safety is one very important reason - but also to have an enjoyable time together with your horse and not the fearful, exhausting fight because the horse and rider do not communicate well. We often blame the horse, but in reality we are to blame, since in most cases it is lack of communication skills from the person, who does not speak \"horse\". When people ask me: My horse is bucking with me, can you fix it? I answer with another question: When and why do yo think your horse is bucking? I can \"fix\" it in most cases, but that would be like removing the symptoms and not the reason for the bucking which in most cases is due to something the rider does. So the horse will continue bucking when his owner continues to do the same thing. Learning to be in control, dominate and become the leader of the horse- - not by showing the horse \"who is the boss\" which will create fear in this prey and flight animal rather than trust - and in it for the horse dangerous situation, the horse will take leadership and do what HE thinks best: RUN. So if the rider has not earned the leadership over the horse, the horse might LIKE the person, but not trust the person to make good decisions if they are scared. We give people tools to learn this language and how to earn the title of being the protector of the horse.\nThe understanding of directing the energy instead of confining it ( which is our usual predator instinct to do) is the key. Preventing a prey and flight animal from running in a situation he is fearful, will only add to this fear. A good way of fixing a bad habit is to become part of the solution for the horse by directing his energy immediately after his attention is back to the person. The instructor, Danehill\u2019s owner Karin Dilou, is passionate about passing on the horsemanship knowledge she has learned \"the hard way\" herself over a long life living with her herd of Danish warmblood horses. A basic key ingredient for success to learn this is patience with ourselves and being observant and focused. It gives her utmost pleasure to give her students tools to become, confident, focused, goal, respectful and happy protectors which is what the horses are looking for in a herd leader. Jokingly we refer to Danehill Manor as: The Stress Free Zone. Having stress, being irritable or impatient, fearful, angry etc. will NOT work in the communication with the horses. It needs to be assertive, firm, polite and precise when we gently ASK them (not make them) do things to get the response we are looking for. We need to be pro active by asking the horse to do something, before the horse makes a decision on his own that we then need to fix, The horse is \"telling us\" a lot through his body language and we get many warnings BEFORE they make their own decisions. You will learn to recognize the \"questions\" from the horse.\nBy getting a deep understanding for this, has opened a door to knowledge about communication, leadership, teamwork and body language not only between horses and people, but very much between people too. The horses are in fact therefore also the co-facilitators when we run those seminars at Danehill. See further description under seminars.\nThe students become \u201clearners\u201d through play. The horses like to play too. The old saying: when the student is ready, the teacher appears comes to mind. They learn for their own sake. The instructor does not explain in words to children what is going on between her, them and the horses, but do explain that to grown up clients before and after the actual interaction with the horses. Children naturally absorb the horses\u2019 as well as the instructor\u2019s body language, energy, attitude and focus which they subconsciously react to. Thus it is very important to be honest and congruent in words as well as body language how we feel in order to be successful with both the children and the horses in order to build up their trust and create a mutual respect. At the moment I have two 5 year old boys \u2013 the youngest students so far. It has taken awhile to build up the children\u2019s attention and focus to \u00bd hour at a time and important not to \"force\" it, but continuously keep it interesting, rewarding and fun. It actually is the horses that \"reward\" the kids and they LOVE it when that happens, feeling in control with their bod language. To ALSO \u201cbe ahead of \u201c the child and at the same time \u201cbe ahead of the horse\u201d with at least 4 horse lengths in decisions about what we want the horse to do (how fast or slow, to go right or left at which point, to turn etc.), is something I have developed over time. It takes patience and focus from my side too \u2013 both to the child AND the horse. Having done it over and over again together and then challenge the child to do it by himself when I feel they are ready is one of the \u201cbig moments\u201d in the development of the child. When the child realizes his power and leadership skills giving these huge animals directions with small gestures what to do, when to run fast, slow turn and stop, and the horse actually listens to and responds in action to what the child asks him to do, is a wonderful experience.\nThe students learn to pay attention at all times and think ahead. \u201cPrevention is better than cure\u201d. The most difficult thing to learn is patience with and respect to ourselves \u2013 which we also give our students tools to learn.\nTo make a lesson with horses successful stress cannot be part of the day. A stressful (or in any way tense, frustrated, irritated or angry) person is NOT considered a trusting leader in the horse\u2019s mind. If the person is tense or impatient because the horse is not doing, what the person THOUGHT he asked him to do, the horse will soon be frustrated and \"give up communicating\" with this person, since that handler in the horse's mind does not seem to know what they want or doesn't trust himself that the horse in fact WILL listen to his \"question\". The horse read's the handler's subconscious mind which often includes not trusting himself. That is reflected in his posture, energy, way of breathing etc. and we cannot lie or be ambiguous to the horses. That confuses them. The horse might do what we want them to if we beat them up or get rough with them\u2013 but out of fear - which is very counter productive if we want a good partnership with 51% leadership to the handler. In situations where they are frightened they will not trust the person\u2019s decisions as a protector. - and that can be dangerous (bucking, rearing, running wild etc).\nBeing on time or a little early is one of several things that can eliminate some stress. If prepared and thought through well in advance - step for step \u2013 and the student looks forward to a fun successful time, the lesson becomes pleasant for everybody.. I custom make the lessons to the children so it becomes a positive lovely experience for both them and the horses \u2013 (and me) - every time . Many factors can be different from time to time, but we always end on a positive note - both for the horse's and for the handler's sake.\nOne thing that is important for the success with the kids is that parents or guardians do not interfere or \u201chelp\u201d in any possible way from the moment they arrive at the gate. Children like horses can only have one leader over them, otherwise confusion sets in. Parents or guardians can always \u201cfollow up\u201d afterwards by asking the students questions and have them -uninterruptedly while paying full attention to them - explain what they did. Having the child explain and maybe even teach the parent what to do, makes them learn even better. I LOVE it when my students correct ME - and THEY become the teacher. Mutual respect and attention to each other. The interference in the lesson confuses the child. As is the case with a horse: if several people try to tell them what to do, the horse will make his own decision and NOT consider any of them his trusting leader. That is when accidents happen. If the child wants to \u201cshow off\u201d to the parent to get the much desired approval and burst of admiration \u2013 the \u201cego\u201d comes in the way for the focus on the horse and the whole lesson will be counter productive. In many ways it is the case with adults too when they have an audience.\nAsk, patiently wait for the response and praise when getting the desired \u201canswer\u201d - is the way for the horse \u2013 and the handler of the horse - to learn. If the horse didn\u2019t do what we asked first time around, it was because we didn\u2019t ask clearly enough in the horse\u2019s language. Eventually it becomes \u201csecond nature\u201d and the conversation/gestures lighter and lighter and when true unity is established it is merely a thought and the horse will respond. It feels as if the horse is psychic, but what it really is, is that he is reading your subconscious mind that is your true self and directly connected to your body language.\nUnder construction, more information to come soon!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T16:26:11Z", "url": "https://www.danehillmanor.com/lessons", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Over the past five years, I\u2019ve analyzed data on a wide range of products from lip balm to dog food, from potato chips to kefir. And while categories of interest have changed, my general best practices for analyzing the data remain constant. Data can be complicated and challenging, but, if you know how to harness it, transform it, and understand its meaning, it can be a game-changer with immense value to your business.\nAs a part of SPINS\u2019 Brand Growth Solutions team, I work with clients every day to bring the data to life and make it actionable for their businesses. While I can\u2019t reveal all of my team\u2019s secrets in this post, I will lay out three insider tips that we use to transform data on a daily basis.\nBecause there\u2019s often so many factors that can drive business, it can be overwhelming to know where to start digging for answers. I find it helpful to generate a list of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) probable hypotheses to easily identify the top contenders and eliminate those that are less likely. This planning and forethought always saves me time because it provides a targeted list of analyses to consider, and every analysis assists in either proving or disproving the most likely hypothetical causes. By setting myself up for success on the front end, I find more time to generate insights and implications on the back end.\nIt always helps to understand the whole picture. It\u2019s not enough to say that a brand is growing 10%. I always make data points relevant to my audience by benchmarking it back to something. Is that 10% accelerated or decelerated from the prior year? Is that 10% higher or lower than the category? Is that 10% better or worse than projected estimates? The easiest way to make data mean something is by making a comparative \u201cthan\u201d statement.\nVisuals are the KEY to bringing data to life and telling the story. As data analysts, it\u2019s our job to make the numbers meaningful. We\u2019re doing the data a disservice every time we copy and paste a raw data chart from Excel onto a slide. To mitigate this, I find it most helpful to ask myself, which hypothesis will I demonstrate here? (See Tip #1.) Then my follow-up question is, what kind of chart or visualization is going to best represent this data and make the point clear? The simplest rule to follow is to visualize one point per slide. Finally, when I make the point with a visually descriptive chart, I always highlight the insight for my audience, as well. In addition to the charts and visualizations, I know it\u2019s important for me to narrate the story in the data to help my audience fully understand each insight and implication.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T02:50:22Z", "url": "https://www.spins.com/three-tips-for-translating-data-to-insights/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "A new, segmented, negative-strand RNA virus with morphological and sequence similarities to other viruses in the genus Emaravirus was discovered in raspberry plants exhibiting symptoms of leaf blotch disorder, a disease previously attributed to the eriophyid raspberry leaf and bud mite (Phyllocoptes gracilis). The virus, tentatively named raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV), has five RNAs that each potentially encode a single protein on the complementary strand. RNAs 1, 2 and 3 encode, respectively, a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a glycoprotein precursor and the nucleocapsid. RNA4 encodes a protein with sequence similarity to proteins of unknown function that are encoded by the genomes of other emaraviruses. When expressed transiently in plants fused to green or red fluorescent protein, the RLBV P4 protein localized to the peripheral cell membrane and to punctate spots in the cell wall. These spots co-localized with GFP-tagged tobacco mosaic virus 30K cell-to-cell movement protein, which is itself known to associate with plasmodesmata. These results suggest that the P4 protein may be a movement protein for RLBV. The fifth RLBV RNA, encoding the P5 protein, is unique among the sequenced emaraviruses. The amino acid sequence of the P5 protein does not suggest any potential function; however, when expressed as a GFP fusion, it localized as small aggregates in the cytoplasm near to the periphery of the cell.\nThe GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the sequences reported in this paper are FR823299 (RNA1), FR823300 (RNA2), FR823301 (RNA3), FR823302 (RNA4) and FR823303 (RNA5).\nTwo supplementary figures and a supplementary table are available with the online version of this paper.\nAhn K.

{"text": "Location privacy took a hit in California yesterday when Governor Jerry Brown vetoed SB 1434, an EFF- and ACLU-sponsored bill that would have required law enforcement to apply for a search warrant in order to obtain location tracking information. Despite the bill's passing through the state legislature with overwhelming bipartisan support, despite local newspaper editorials in favor of the bill, and despite more than 1,300 concerned Californians using our action center to urge him to sign the bill into law, Governor Brown instead decided to sell out privacy rights to law enforcement.\nIt's not the first time, either. Last year, he did the same thing with SB 914, a bill that would have required police to obtain a search warrant before searching an arrested individual\u2019s cell phone incident to arrest.\nIt may be that legislative action is needed to keep the law current in our rapidly evolving electronic age. But I am not convinced that this bill strikes the right balance between the operational needs of law enforcement and individual expectations of privacy.\nSkeptical about a law enforcement sponsored bill claiming to protect privacy? You should be. As we explained to Governor Brown, AB 2055 doesn\u2019t do anything at all.\nAB 2055 is a narrow response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Jones, which held the Fourth Amendment required law enforcement to obtain a search warrant before installing a GPS device on a car. In theory, AB 2055 changes California law to explicitly permit law enforcement to apply to a judge for a search warrant to install a GPS device. But in fact, it does not require police to obtain a search warrant. It just says they can apply for one. So to the extent it attempts to codify Jones, it fails. And, more basically, there\u2019s no need to codify Jones: the Supreme Court\u2019s decision is the law and California law enforcement officials have to follow it, regardless of what state law says.\nThat\u2019s not the only problem with AB 2055. That law only applies to GPS devices, and not the other myriad ways law enforcement can obtain location information without installing a GPS device. With increasing concern about law enforcement\u2019s growing addiction to warrantless cell phone tracking \u2014 which a federal appeals court in New Orleans will be hearing argument about tomorrow \u2014 any legislative action needs to be forward-looking and future-proof. And while we might expect a state that boasts the world's biggest technology companies and just legalized self-driving cars to move the law forward, Governor Brown has instead decided to maintain the status quo.\nUltimately law enforcement got exactly what it wanted with AB 2055, which is nothing at all. And while Governor Brown joins the chorus \u2014 which included Justice Alito in his concurring opinion in Jones \u2014 that solemnly speaks of the need to update our electronic privacy laws to reflect the changing technological landscape, his words ring hollow when he vetoes a bill that had bipartisan legislative support. Because in the end, all that's been done since the first federal electronic privacy bill was passed in 1986 has been a steady diet of allowing law enforcement to gorge itself on as much data and information they can eat without a warrant. It's no surprise that now they're hooked, they'll do whatever it takes to keep the information faucet on. Governor Brown's veto of SB 1434 only continues this dangerous trend.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T12:15:13Z", "url": "https://www.eff.org/es/node/71964", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The \u201cMaserati\u201d of something\u2014vacuums, lawnmowers, what have you\u2014might be the most graceful and sensuous of its type; were Maserati to paste a trident on a Jeep Cherokee, that too would be a Maserati SUV. With the Levante, Maserati is making a hard case for the former.\nDenuded, the new Levante evokes the shape of much more pedestrian fare: Infiniti's QX60, another wagonoid. That isn\u2019t unfortunate, just a testament to the fact that there are only so many ways to shape a sport utility. (The new Jaguar F-Pace beautifully apes the first-generation BMW X5.) With eyes stolen from Maserati\u2019s Afieri Concept, the Levante harbors as much squinty menace as its Quattroporte and Ghibli siblings and the typical Maserati cues, trident-inspired wheels, scalloped grill and fender portholes work together handsomely. Still, the Levante in person suffers some of what has undermined the Ghibli: a lack of presence. It\u2019s striking but a little stubby, like Peter Dinklage.\nDynamically, the Levante is bound to be athletic. In the U.S., it will come in two guises: The base model, at $72,000, with a 345-horsepower version of the Maserati 3-liter, twin-turbo V-6, and the S, priced around $83,000, with a 424-horsepower version of that same engine. The de rigeur 8-speed ZF transmission will be seamless; adaptive dampers and what Maserati says is the SUV world\u2019s lowest center of gravity will keep things nice and planted, like a ball of burrata dropped on a tile floor. Perfect 50:50 front-rear weight distribution is nice, and gives future owners an excuse to demand passengers take odd seats to maintain balance, like a stewardess on a small regional turbo-prop.\nI\u2019m ambivalent. Unlike the aforementioned F-Pace, or Lincoln\u2019s exuberant Navigator Concept, I didn\u2019t immediately love the Levante. Then again, I had my fingers crossed for a run of original, 1967 Ghiblis suspended over monster-truck tires, which is called \u201csetting yourself up for disappointment.\u201d To muster up some appropriately passionate love for Maserati\u2019s new truck, I talked to Giovanni Ribotta, Maserati\u2019s Chief Exterior Designer. No one can better convince you of a child\u2019s charms that its father. Here are four.\nThe front of the Levante embodies the on-road/off-road duality Maserati wanted for its first truck. A dark, carbon fiber-effect skidplate juts out a touch beyond the bumper, almost like the spoiler of a racing car. According to Ribotta, the skid-plate is self-consciously \u201coff-road, but integrated into a dynamic front.\u201d As far as hammer-screwdrivers go, it\u2019s a cute one.\nRibotta pointed out that, absent bumpers and a couple other modern affectations, the Levante is working in the same design framework as some of Maserati\u2019s most famous coupes. In his words: \u201cThe Levante shape is defined by a strong center spine and the four fenders\u2014as a racing car, from the past. Like the Birdcage or a Type 61.\u201d Does the Mercedes GLC bear the footprint of a 300SL Gullwing? We have yet to hear that case made.\nWhen asked if he might be offended when future Levante owners adorned his streamlined design with awkward racks, rails and boxes, as SUV owners are wont to do, Ribotta smiled graciously. \u201cWe did our roof rails. We designed every accessory that will go on the car. With the engineering team, we tried to make the rails as slender as possible. And as beautiful. We aren\u2019t angry.\u201d If you do buy a Levante and take the thing to Vail, you won't enjoy the transgressive thrill of spoiling a the Levante's slick design. Settle instead for a drive in Maserati's handsome stab at market share\u2014it should be a good one.\nWhat's it like inside Maserati's first-ever SUV? Find out with a 360-degree virtual tour.\nThe Bentley Bentayga Is the Most Expensive SUV. Ever.\nOur first drive goes off-road, while Bentley\u2019s styling team runs off the rails.\nBecause everyone needs an overdesigned mall mauler.\nDrive Wire: Is This Maserati's New SUV in the Arctic Circle?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T12:26:50Z", "url": "https://www.thedrive.com/design/2721/the-maserati-levantes-chief-designer-sells-us-a-maserati-levante", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

I had a fabulous time competing, but Olympian Simon Whitfield can sleep peacefully knowing that I will not be challenging any of his records any time soon.\nI decided that in my mid 30\u2019s it was time to try something new in order to stay in shape. I was getting bored of doing the same old thing at the gym (when I went). I decided on triathlons, because I love to swim, I enjoy a good bike ride, and I can tolerate running for 10 kilometers.\nThe biggest obstacle when starting anything new of course is getting over your fears: fear of failure, fear of looking foolish, fear of not finishing or finishing last. But like many things we do in life, most of our fears only exist in our heads, and rarely play out in reality. Life has taught me that my biggest fear in life, is not living it.\nYou learn a lot about yourself when you try something new, sports, business or otherwise.

{"text": "Clawson and Staubes provides representation to both plaintiffs and defendants in claims involving daycare abuse and neglect. Whether you are a parent whose child has been injured or neglected at a daycare or you are a childcare facility accused of such conduct, we have the experience necessary to handle your case at any level.\nParents place absolute trust in daycare facilities to provide a safe and nurturing environment for the most valued and vulnerable members of our society: our children. Unfortunately, annual statistics from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services show that there are more than 3,600 instances of abuse and neglect at daycare facilities nationwide each year.\nIn 2014, state lawmakers enacted a law permitting licensed inspectors to inspect home daycare centers unannounced to ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing the operations of child care facilities. As a result of the new law, which was enacted following the death of a 3-month-old infant in Greenville County, DSS inspectors have closed over 50 child daycares since 2014.\nDrowning in various bodies or pools of water.\nMental and emotional injury can also result to the child, the effects of which may linger for years, potentially resulting in a significant claim against the daycare facility. These claims, which arise from a unique area of law, require the assistance of experienced counsel. Cases are often fact intensive and require attorneys with knowledge of the regulatory framework imposed by the S.C. Department of Social Services on child care service providers and capable of conducting a detailed investigation of the allegations in an effort to evaluate the potential liability. Furthermore, daycare abuse and neglect claims often require the identification and use of expert testimony to establish the nature and extent of the injuries suffered or likely to be suffered by the child. Punitive damages may be recoverable if the conduct of the daycare center or its employees was particularly egregious.\nOur daycare abuse and neglect attorneys are experienced in representing both plaintiffs and defendants in cases involving allegations of physical injury, wrongful death, choking, suffocation, drowning, poisoning, burns, and sexual abuse. These cases can be complex because of the various laws, statutes, regulations, and administrative procedures that families and childcare facilities must navigate. Thus, it is imperative that you hire an attorney who has the experience necessary to ensure that your claim is handled properly. Our attorneys are equipped to provide you with competent counsel and assist you in navigating what is sure to be a very emotional ordeal for all involved.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T19:54:04Z", "url": "https://www.clawsonandstaubes.com/litigation/day-care/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

And that's where I expect the fun to start. This girl can shoot 9's and .40's all day long. I keep joking with her that she needs one of those pink guns cause she's a girl. Of course, I Keep getting back-handed too.\nI live out of state, but my experience has been mixed.\nI shoot with a local ladies club and we have ladies' (only) classes and monthly get togethers at a local range. The range owner is very supportive of us using the range, gives us a discount on port time and trains the RSOs to respect ladies and not talk down to us. We have women instructors and the men who are instructors are taught to listen and not talk down/talk over and generally act in a respectful manner. The owner is extremely conscious of his female and racial minority clientele as he wants the range to be welcome to all, regardless of gender or race. Being both a person of color and a woman it can be daunting to (no offense intended) wander into a sport/pastime/interest populated mostly by white men. Or at least you'll see that in the media.\nUnfortunately the experience I've gotten at some other ranges is because I am a woman I get attitude as to whether I know anything about guns. One of my club's ranges the RSO is always telling me I should probably try a lighter caliber as the gun I am shooting is too big (!!!). For the record it was a .45ACP. And I can punch holes in a quarter at 25 yards.\nOther things, let's see. Go into a gun shop and get asked if I want a gift certificate. Being shown everything pink (I don't like pink) as if pink magically transforms any item into a woman's.\nBut there are a lot in the community who will treat me like an equal. That is welcome. Honestly though, I do enjoy the ladies only get togethers because we can talk about stuff we don't talk with the guys about.\nkate_r wrote: I live out of state, but my experience has been mixed.\nI'm glad to hear some positive experiences, along with the the not so positive. Feel free to post anytime, you said you are out of state, but you didn't name which state you are in.

While we want children to respect the museum and its artwork, tours emphasize interaction\u2014we encourage students to talk about what they see and ask questions. Tours aren\u2019t a lecture\u2014they are a chance for your class to explore and express themselves.\nBefore your visit, lead a class discussion to help the students determine how to be safe, engage and have fun in the museum.\nWhat does it means to be safe in a museum?\n\u2022 Keep three feet away from the art, walls and pedestals.\nWhy? The artwork is old, fragile, and irreplaceable\u2014it is our job to keep it in good shape for the community to enjoy for generations to come.\n\u2022 Leave food, gum and drinks in the designated place.\nWhy? Food can damage art and can attract bugs that destroy art.\n\u2022 Walk carefully and avoid running or climbing. No one wants to bump and knock over the art or temporary walls.\n\u2022 Take as many photos as you want\u2014without a flash. Light may damage some artwork.\n\u2022 Look quietly and carefully when directed.\n\u2022 Think of questions you have about art.\n\u2022 Raise your hand and ask your questions!\n\u2022 Listen to what everyone has to say\u2014your classmates, docents and teachers.

Does the art remind you of something or someone?\n\u2022 Express your feelings and opinions about the art!\nWhat does fun look like in an art museum?\n\u2022 Hearing about how everyone sees, likes and understands the same work of art very differently.\n\u2022 Figuring out what a work of art means.\n\u2022 Expressing what you see or think.\n\u2022 Participating in collaborative group activities.\n\u2022 Getting involved in hands-on activities in the galleries.\n\u2022 Remembering the tour through a free take home booklet with art and activities.\nWhat is the class signal to get students attention?\nYour docent will want to know what signal your class uses to get the group\u2019s attention when they are on tour (clapping, hand signals, a class word, etc).\nTo prepare for a tour, you and your students should practice looking at art and asking questions. You will find that with practice, your students will enjoy exploring new art and that they have a lot to say. They will become skilled at reading the art and understanding what the artist is saying. This exercise is more fun than if we tell them what we know.\nSelect any work of art. You may look on the museum website tour description page for some works included in your tour.\nAsk them to look quietly at the work of art. Set a timer for two to five minutes. With practice they will want to look longer. There is no need to tell them anything about the work of art before you start.\nAsk them to describe what they see and point to where it is in the artwork. You may be surprised at the details your students identify. This exercise helps them focus and build language skills.\nAsk your students what questions they have about this work of art.

I tried it a couple of years ago and think that it can be a great time saver for those who have limited time to make a lunch, those who work outside the home and those who want to eat healthier and having a nutritious meal prepped helps them do so. I know that you guys are a fan of salads in a jar because my Barbeque Chicken Mason Jar Salads are my most popular salad recipe of all time. I thought that it was about time to share this delicious Mason Jar Taco Salads recipe with you.\nFor these Mason Jar Taco Salads, I made a bunch of them on a Sunday and enjoyed them through the week. As long as you layer them right (especially the dressing), they will last at least a few days. You can choose to make them vegetarian with black beans or tofu. Or you can add meat such as ground beef, shredded chicken, beef or pork. They all will work great!\nI wanted to add a bunch of color so I used tomatoes, yellow and orange bell peppers, green onions, romaine lettuce, black beans and more. The dressing was super simple: I just mixed together light creamy caesar dressing and salsa. It work also work well with ranch dressing. These mason jar salads are filling, nutritious and so easy to take with you on a busy day!\nMix together salsa and salad dressing. Pour dressing into the bottom of two quart-sized mason jars.\nAfter the dressing is in the jars, layer tomatoes, followed by the peppers, black beans, cheddar and green onion in the jars. Fill to the top with lettuce.\nStores well in the fridge for about 3-5 days. Dump contents of jar onto a plate or in a bowl and eat. Enjoy!\n**Since the dressing is wet, make sure to put on the bottom of the jar with the tomatoes. The lettuce goes on the top so that it does not get soggy.\nWhat a great idea!

{"text": "\u201cFrankie Peak\u201d (far right; 2375m) and \u201cLarry Mountain\u201d (right of centre; 2375m) from the summit of \u201cTable Top\u201d. Both peaks were unofficially named by Andrew Nugara in honour of his mother and step-father.\nAnother view of \u201cFrankie Peak\u201d (right of centre) this time from Lys Ridge. We ascended using the ridge that begins in the foreground centre. Our original plan was to make a loop that included \u201cFrankie\u201d, \u201cLarry\u201d (right of \u201cFrankie\u201d), and North Castle (far right \u2013 summit not shown). Instead, icy conditions thwarted our trip from \u201cFrankie\u201d to \u201cLarry\u201d and we ended up tagging \u201cEagle Peak\u201d (centre left) and Whistler Mountain (far left) as an alternate loop.\n\u201cFrankie Peak\u201d and its twin, \u201cLarry Mountain\u201d are prominent peaks that are located south of Table Mountain in the Castle Wilderness. I had my first good look at them in May 2014 while hiking what I call, \u201cThe Whistler Loop\u201d, a collection of unnamed peaks on the connecting ridge between Table Mountain and Whistler Mountain. Later, I learned that my friend, Brad Wolcott, had ascended them as part of an enjoyable trip from Whistler Mountain to Mount Gladstone. In September 2016, my curiosity was renewed while hiking Lys Ridge with Andrew Nugara and Jollin Charest. Andrew told me that he had unofficially named them, \u201cFrankie Peak\u201d and \u201cLarry Mountain\u201d in honour of his mother and step-father. He had first ascended \u201cFrankie\u201d in May 2009 via Whistler Mountain, and then returned one month later using the same approach to summit \u201cLarry\u201d and then North Castle.\nTherefore, with Andrew\u2019s trip reports as my guide, I began to plan my own trip. The major variation that I wanted to make from both Andrew\u2019s trips and Brad\u2019s trip, was to save distance by avoiding Whistler Mountain on my approach. Like Andrew, I wanted to summit \u201cFrankie\u201d, \u201cLarry\u201d, and then North Castle, but I thought that I could make a more compact loop by ascending a ridge that led up from the South Castle Road on the western side of the mountain. This would save quite a bit of walking distance back to my vehicle after descending North Castle.\nJoining me for this trip was my middle son, Nathan, who had celebrated his 20th birthday the day before, and was anxious to try out the new backpack that he had received as a gift. Also with us, was Nathan\u2019s (and my other son, Joel\u2019s) friend Keagan, who last joined us on our hike up Morin Peak in the Crowsnest Pass. Keegan basically lives at our house, so I will also count him as one of my mine too. \ud83d\ude42 I love hiking with my kids!\nAt first, everything went according to plan, especially the ascent which all three of us agreed was a blast. However, after summiting \u201cFrankie\u201d, we discovered that the exposed ramp that Andrew had used to descend the cliff band on the east side of the mountain was covered in ice. To make matters worse, we had to battle extreme wind gusts which made for miserable conditions. So we quickly changed our plans and made a new loop by heading north where we tagged the summits of \u201cEagle Peak\u201d (\u201cWhistable II\u201d) and Whistler Mountain before descending back to the road \u2013 basically doing everything that I wanted to avoid. Nevertheless, neither Nathan nor Keegan had been to these peaks before and I was happy that they still had the opportunity to record their first ever, three peak day. I will definitely return when conditions allow for a successful descent between \u201cFrankie\u201d and \u201cLarry\u201d.\nOur starting point was identical to that of our Lys Ridge trip. To get here, we headed south from the hamlet of Beaver Mines along Highway 774 until we came to the turnoff for Beaver Mines Lake. Here we turned left and followed the gravel road for ~3.7km until we came to the South Castle Road, which was located on our right. We followed the road for ~600m before arriving at a couple of information signs for the Castle Special Management Area. Also in the immediate vicinity were numerous random camping spots.\nHere is where things get interesting and unless you have a 4\u00d74 or some type of high clearance vehicle, you will need to park your car and get out your bike. Fortunately, I had my trusty 4Runner so we followed the road across the dry creek bed and proceeded another 6.9km down what at times, was a rough road, until we came to a washed out section just beyond a well marked camping site next to the Castle River. We parked across the road from the campsite. As a side note, almost all of the mud holes that you have to drive through on the road are not too deep, except for the last one immediately prior to the parking area. This is the deepest one (1/2 way up my wheels) and I\u2019ve found that it is the shallowest on the east side \u2013 just don\u2019t stop once you\u2019ve started going through!\nFrom our parking spot we walked ~100m further to the south along the road until we came to the washout itself. Here we left the road and followed the creek bed east and then southeast for ~550m until we reached the base of our ascent route. We found it was easier to follow the numerous game trails located on the east side of the creek rather than staying inside the bed. When we reached the base, we crossed the creek using a game trail and a couple of well-positioned boulders.\nFrom the creek, the initial slope is wide open and grassy. Once we reached the first shoulder, the route narrowed into a ridge and became increasingly rocky and treed. From the first shoulder to the second shoulder, we encountered thicker forest cover and frequent bands of rock \u2013 which required lots of route finding. Here we donned our helmets as some sections required hands-on scrambling. The ridge walk along the second shoulder to where it abuts against the main ridge to \u201cFrankie\u201d involved some light to moderate scrambling with most obstacles avoided by sticking to climber\u2019s right. However, just prior to the abutment we encountered a small cliff that would prove to be the crux. I found an exposed ledge to climber\u2019s right, but we found an even safer route by retracing our steps and descending to climber\u2019s left which allowed us to bypass it completely. From here it was an easy hike up a packed argillite slope to the main ridge.\nThe ridge walk to \u201cFrankie\u201d would have been really enjoyable if it weren\u2019t for the extreme wind gusts. To make matters worse, the light dusting of snow on the south side of the mountain had undergone a quick thaw/freeze cycle that made for some slick conditions \u2013 nothing that hampered our ascent, but definitely something that we did not want to attempt an exposed downclimb in.\nFrom the summit we descended towards \u201cLarry\u201d and found Andrew\u2019s exposed ramp, which in dry conditions would have been great, but not on this day. We could see that to bypass the cliff band, we would have to lose a significant amount of elevation over icy rocks while enduring extreme wind gusts \u2013 not fun! So we nixed our original plan and decided to knock off \u201cEagle Peak\u201d and Whistler Mountain instead. To avoid the wind along the ridge, we descended the northwest face of Frankie and cut across a hanging valley to the col beneath \u201cEagle Peak\u201d. The ever-increasing wind ensured that we had a miserable ascent to the summit. From here we had an easy but windy hike to Whistler Mountain before descending down the trail to the South Castle Road and then walking ~1.6km back to our vehicle.\nWe loved our ascent route to \u201cFrankie Peak\u201d and I will readily use it again when I return. Be aware though, that at some point in the future, this road will be permanently closed to motorized vehicles as part of the new Castle Wildland Provincial Park. There may also be an overnight option, where a party could knock off every summit from Table Mountain to Mount Gladstone and then North Castle. Indeed, the hanging valley between \u201cEagle Peak\u201d and \u201cFrankie\u201d would be a very nice spot to camp!\nOur total distance ended up being 12.5km with total elevation gains of 1323m. From our vehicle to the summit of \u201cFrankie\u201d it was 4.2km. Our total time came in at 6 hours and 41 minutes.\nOur parking spot on the east side of the road across from the campsite next to the Castle River. I had turned the vehicle around so that it was facing northwest \u2013 or the direction we came from. The washout is located just ~100m further down the road behind my vehicle. This was also the same starting point for our Lys Ridge trip.\nApproximately ~100m south of my vehicle, we came to a washed out section of the South Castle Road. Here we would leave the road and follow the creek bed to the left.\nLooking down the creek bed from the middle of the road. The first shoulder on our ascent route as well as the main ridge that leads to \u2018Frankie\u201d, can be seen in the distance to the right of centre.\nWe found it was easier to stay on the east side (climber\u2019s left) of the creek bed. Here the bushwhacking was relatively light and we could utilize intermittent game trails.\nA few of the game trails wanted to leave the creek bed too early. We followed this one until it began to head up the western slope beneath Whistler Mountain. It did however, give us our first clear view of the lower section of our ascent route.\nA telephoto of the previous picture. The Castle is such an amazing place!\nLooking south down the valley towards Sage Mountain (centre) and Mount Matkin (right).\nLooking west at our Lys Ridge ascent route.\nThe view to the northwest at \u201cThe Amoeba\u201d on Barnaby Ridge (left) and Southfork Mountain (centre).\nThe terrain became rockier as we gained elevation.\nThe hiking is pretty straightforward between the base and the first shoulder.\nKeegan and Nathan stop to take in the early morning views.\nAfter reaching the first shoulder, we began to encounter frequent rock bands (mostly Finnish death metal groups who had become lost during album cover photo shoots \ud83d\ude09 ) and heavier forest cover.\nI couldn\u2019t resist including another shot of the morning sunlight hitting Barnaby Ridge and Southfork Mountain.\nWe had a blast with all of the route finding on this ascent!\nOne of many obstacles that we encountered on the way up.\nThe reverse angle of the previous picture.\nMorning sunlight spotlights Mount Matkin and the slopes of Lys Ridge. Castle Peak is on the far left.\nTypical terrain before reaching the second shoulder. There were many possible routes and we seemed to solve any doubts by trending climber\u2019s right.\nNathan and Keegan enjoy a welcome break from the wind just below the second shoulder.\nAfter reaching the second shoulder we could finally see where it joined the main ridge. The summit of \u201cFrankie\u201d is not yet visible.\nThe ridge walk along the second shoulder presented easy to moderate options for scrambling. Due to extreme wind gusts, we avoided getting too close to the crest.\nNathan and Keegan make their way along the gorgeous little ridge.\n\u2026except for the crux. It doesn\u2019t look like much from this angle, but it presented us with a small cliff face that halted our progress.\nI found an exposed ledge to climber\u2019s right, but by backtracking we found an even safer route by descending to climber\u2019s left. Here we could circumvent the crux without too much difficulty.\nAnother look back at the crux. The exposed ledge that I rejected is the vegetated patch on the left.\nA more comprehensive view to the north. The Whistler Firelookout is on the far left and \u201cEagle Peak\u201d (\u201cWhistable II\u201d) is on the right.\nThe hike from the abutment to the main ridge was over packed argillite and presented no difficulties.\nLooking back from the crest of the main ridge as Nathan and Keegan make their approach (lower centre). Our vehicle is parked next to the bend in the river that can be seen in the centre.\nOnce on the main ridge we could finally see the summit of \u201cFrankie Peak\u201d. The summit of \u201cLarry Mountain\u201d is to the left.\nNathan and Keegan begin an extremely windy ridge walk to the summit of Frankie.\nIf we had chosen a less windy day, this would\u2019ve been a fun ridge walk.\nTaking shelter from the wind to consume some calories and put on more layers.\nMany of the rocks on the south side of the mountain were coated in clear ice.\nNathan and Keegan slowly and carefully pick their way up to the summit.\nThe summit of \u201cFrankie Peak\u201d. My GPS read 2370m and Andrew Nugara\u2019s read 2375m.\nNathan arrives on his first summit of his twentieth year. Keegan is just behind him.\nThe summit offered gorgeous views! This is the view to the east. In the foreground is \u201cLarry Mountain\u201d and behind it is Mount Gladstone. In the distance is Victoria Peak and foreground right is North Castle. \u201cWhitney Creek Mountain\u201d is on the far left.\nThe view to the northwest. The Whistler Fire Lookout is on the far left, followed by Whistler Mountain and then the \u201cWhistable Peaks\u201d with \u201cEagle Peak\u201d (\u201cWhistable II\u201d) in the centre.\nThe view north at \u201cTable Top\u201d (foreground) and Table Mountain (right of centre).\nThe view south at a beclouded Castle Peak and Windsor Mountain. North Castle is in the foreground. Our originally planned loop for the day included \u201cLarry Mountain\u201d and North Castle.\nLooking southwest at Lys Ridge. The summit of Lys Ridge is on the far left and West Castle is to the left of centre. Lys Ridge was one of the best ridge walks that I\u2019ve ever done! In the background is Barnaby Ridge.\nAt roughly the same time that we were on the summit of \u201cFrankie\u201d, a party of 6 hikers had to be rescued off of Mount Haig which is located directly to the west, behind Barnaby Ridge. One of the hikers had been seriously injured and because of the weather (notice the clouds), a helicopter rescue was impossible. While the other 5 made it down the mountain, the injured person was forced to spend the night on the mountain under the care of a public safety officer from Waterton Parks. A huge thanks to all of the people who work in Search & Rescue and to all of the First Responders. Hopefully the injured person will be okay.\nKeegan and Nathan on the summit of \u201cFrankie Peak\u201d.\nAlways great to stand on a summit with your kids! Happy 20th birthday Nathan!\nThe wind ruined any thought of a lengthy summit stay, so we began to descend towards the col between \u201cFrankie\u201d and \u201cLarry Mountain\u201d.\nThe north face of \u201cFrankie\u201d is really steep!\nBypassing the cliff further to the south required a significant detour over slippery rocks \u2013 all while hiking into the wind. This is where we changed our plans.\nHeading back to the summit of \u201cFrankie\u201d to attempt our alternate loop.\nLooking from the upper northwest slopes of \u201cFrankie Peak\u201d to \u201cEagle Peak\u201d(right) and Whistler Mountain (centre) \u2013 our alternate loop for the day. To get out of the wind and avoid a slow descent along the ridge, we descended the northwest face of \u201cFrankie\u201d and cut across this hanging valley to the col beneath \u201cEagle Peak\u201d (\u201cWhistable II\u201d). Click to continue to our \u201cEagle Peak II\u201d trip report.\nI saw you on the summit of Frankie on sunday; I was on my way there from Whistler, can\u2019t believe we didn\u2019t run into each other!!!\nWe saw you too!! We were in the hanging valley when you were just beneath Eagle Peak. By the time we reached the col, we couldn\u2019t see you anymore. We looked on the ridge to Frankie and still couldn\u2019t see you so we thought you might\u2019ve dropped into the valley. Did you make it past Frankie?

Marangu route has been referred to as a Coca-cola route because there is no any challenge physical feature which might bring any difficult during climbing only the altitude can be a challenge on this route due to the few numbers of days for acclimatization but it is the only route which you have your accommodation in the Huts but only when you book in advance.\nOn our last day, we have a long trek mostly downhill through the tropical rainforest. Once at the park headquarters at Marangu gate, we collect our summit certificates.

Also emergency portable oxygen is carried along. On top of that the guides are qualified Wilderness First Responders.\nThe fees for the Kilimanjaro Rescue Team are covered. This is managed by KINAPA, Kilimanjaro National Parks. Interesting fact: Kinapa means \u201cWe carry each other\u201d in Swahili.\nThe park entry fees, the crater fee, camping fee and value added tax are included in the price.\nPer person you generally have a team of 1 guide, 1 cook and 3 porters who will support you in your climb. If you are part of a group of four, you will be able to enjoy 2 guides, 1 cook and 12 porters.

For most nationalities it is possible to get a visa upon arrival when you arrive at the airport in Tanzania. Check with your local Tanzanian embassy or consulate to see what the requirements are.\nThe total amount is also exclusive of flights to and from Tanzania. To get an idea of which airlines are visiting Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA), it is best to have a look at their website.\nYour international travel insurance is your own responsibility. It is important that your travel insurance also covers adventures at a high altitude. Discuss your itinerary with the insurance company before you travel to Tanzania.\nTips for guides and porters are exclusive. You decide what you want to tip, but be generous and read our blog post about tipping when you are planning go trekking in Tanzania.\nWhether you stay in Moshi, Arusha or anywhere else, before and after the trek you have to take care of your own accommodation and meals.\nWhile the intention is to stick to the described route, a certain degree of flexibility is built in. In some cases it may be necessary to change the route here and there. The mountains are full of surprises, and the weather on Mount Kilimanjaro is unpredictable. The guides continuously carry out risk assessments throughout the expedition. It is therefore best to plan a number of extra days in Tanzania to cover for possible unforeseen circumstances. Read all about altitude sickness here.\nUnless you are choosing the Marangu Route, you will be staying in durable tents that are equipped for all weather situations. A few porters will always trek ahead of you to make sure that your tent is ready when you arrive. There will also be tables and chairs. Accommodation comes with freshly prepared meals. Every campsite has a long drop toilet. Along the trek you can find your private space behind a rock. Read all about camping on the Kilimanjaro here.\nDo you reach Uhuru Peak or not? There is a chance that you won\u2019t. Often this depends on the unpredictable weather on the mountain. However, it can also depend on your own physical condition.\nDo you enjoy hiking, have you gone trekking at higher altitudes and do you exercise twice a week on average? With a little extra training, you are soon fit to challenge Mount Kilimanjaro.\nIs this the first time that you are trekking at altitude? Make sure you are well prepared. This is important for your safety, but also for that of your team. Make sure you start six months in advance with an hour\u2019s walk or hike twice a week. Read this blog post and get fit for your Kilimanjaro ascent.\nTrekking in Kilimanjaro requires decent gear. Especially the basics like an 80-90l backpack and quality trekking socks. Also make sure to check our ultimate packing list for trekking Kilimanjaro.\n\u2013 Duffel bag, (waterproof recommended) for porters to carry your equipment.\nBecause Mount Kilimanjaro covers a relatively large surface area and a lot of elevation, the mountain has more or less its own climate. Responsible for the weather patterns around Mount Kilimanjaro are trade winds that bring along moist from the Indian Ocean. Because of these trade winds, the months of March, April, May and November are the wettest. The southern mountain slopes are especially rainy in these months. From January to March there is a greater chance to see snow on and around the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. This can be experienced as negative, but it will any case be much quieter on the trails. Although these are the coldest months, snowfall and cold temperatures can be expected from December to May. The most suitable and most popular season for climbing Kilimanjaro is from June to October. In these months you can choose any route without having to worry about rain too much. If you want a comfortable route during the rainy season, you best choose the Rongai Route, approaching Kilimanjaro from the North. Due to the differences in altitude and the associated climate zones, it is difficult to estimate the temperatures.\nTrekking on Kilimanjaro is hard, both for yourself and your support staff. Per person you have a team who will support you in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. This team usually consists of a guide, three porters and a cook. This way you don\u2019t have to carry your full gear yourself. The guide speaks English and usually the rest of the team speaks English as well. You can make things more interesting by learning a few words of Swahili in advance.\nBookatrekking.com strives to only work with providers who treat porters in a fair manner. Without porters, there is no trekking on Kilimanjaro. They are the heart and soul of your adventure and every day, they carry part of your gear. Bookatrekking.com always tries to find a balance between an affordable trekking adventure and the fair treatment of porters. Read everything about porters on Kilimanjaro here.\nIt is impossible to climb the Mount Kilimanjaro solo. This means that every climber has his or her own team. Both the guide, the assistant guide, the porter and the cook expect a tip. For the whole trek, this sums up to an amount ranging from USD 330 to USD 450. This is per climber, which means that the amount will not be smaller if the group is larger. Be generous. Read our extensive blog about tipping on Mount Kilimanjaro.\nThe currency of Tanzania is the Shilling. We recommend you bring US dollars or Euros to cover the costs of your visa, extra travel, and other. It is easiest to travel in Tanzania with US dollars, but credit cards are also accepted in most places. Before you travel, check with your bank whether your credit or debit card can also be used in Tanzania.\nVisa are required for all visitors, and cost about $50. It is possible to get a visa-on arrival when you arrive at the airport in Tanzania. Look here at the website of the embassy for arranging your visa.\nTanzania is an area where yellow fever occurs and therefore we recommend you to be vaccinated. We also recommend that you have all other vaccinations such as Tetanus, Diphtheria, Polio and Hepatitis A & B up to date. Malaria is present in Tanzania but there are no mosquitoes at high altitude. Always consult your health professional 90 days ahead of departure.\nHuts but only when you book in advance.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T09:19:05Z", "url": "https://bookatrekking.com/en/trek/marangu-route-6-days-shizi-safaris/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "If you are looking for one of the best high end luxury apartment rentals in all of London I highly recommend checking out the Cheval Residence\u2019s Thorney Court Apartments. Located near Hyde Park and Kensington Palace, the apartments are just a short tube ride from the Thames and from being right in downtown London.\nLuckily for me I was upgraded to a two bedroom, two and a half bath penthouse suite with the biggest patio for a rental apartment/condo that I have ever experienced. If you are going to stay here you are going to have quite the amount of pocket change but if you can afford it I highly recommend it.\nThe location is ideal with many grocery stores nearby including a Whole Foods. The concierge are friendly, quick and at your service 24/7. It\u2019s definitely nice when you travel as much as I do when you can go to a grocery store then cook* a meal for yourself in your own kitchen with every utensil imaginable. It is then doubly nice when you realize you don\u2019t have any salt and the concierge brings you a huge container of it in the blink of an eye.\nMy master suite in the apartment had a comfortable king sized bed, flat screen TV, lots of closet/storage space as well as a large window with a view of the neighbourhood. This apartment was so large that I am pretty sure had I been staying with someone else that they could have been yelling in the living room and I wouldn\u2019t have heard them all the way in the master bedroom. Extremely spacious.\nThe master suite also had its own bathroom with two double sinks, a bidet, towel warmer, tub/shower and more of the great smelling bath products that the Cheval properties always have. It is nice that they set you up with amenities just as if it was a hotel, the little things like a towel warmer and quality bath products really make a place and bring it together for me.\nThe second bedroom was a great size as well and its beds could be separated into two single beds if needed. It also had its own full sized bathroom with bidet, warming rack, tub and shower.\nExtras in the property include a powder room, great for if you have visitors to entertain keeping them out of your main bathroom. Also one of the things that I love most about Cheval Residences is that you don\u2019t come into the apartment empty-handed without any food. The property provides you with a few essentials so that you don\u2019t have to run out to the store right away. Various apartments that I have stayed in have provided me with bread, butter, milk, water, tea, coffee, biscuits, popcorn and granola.\nAnother great thing about the Cheval Residences is that they don\u2019t skimp on appliances in the kitchen either. There is always a washer and dryer combo, dishwasher, full sized fridge, coffee maker, tea kettle, stove and oven as well as toasters, coffee makers and more. The drawers are also full of all of the utensils necessary.\nLastly my penthouse suite also had a large living room and a separate dining room area. Just imagine the parties that you could have in this place. The decor to me was very english and made me feel kind of like royalty especially the adorable porcelain dogs on the mantle piece.\nTo book at stay at the Cheval Residences Thorney Court luxury apartment immediately check it out on Booking.com HERE.\nI have also stayed at the Cheval Residences Phoenix House and you can see my review HERE and at the Cheval Residences Gloucester Park which you can view HERE.\nMy stay was hosted by Cheval Residences, however as always all opinions, views, and dreams conquered are my own.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T00:32:10Z", "url": "https://www.travelyourself.ca/cailins-blog/thorney-court-luxury-apartments-near-kensington-palace/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Leading 2017 Isle of Man TT newcomer Adam McLean will be at this year\u2019s Armoy Road Races.\nThe big event will take place on Friday and Saturday, July 28-29.\nJoining McLean, a previous winner of the Junior Support at Armoy, will be local men William Dunlop, Neil Kernohan, Paul Jordan, Darryl Tweed, Paul Robinson, Gary Dunlop, Hexham rider Dominic Herbertson and Moto3/125 GP race winner Christian Elkin, winner of Moto3/125 GP race in 2016.\nWith entries yet to close (July 3) and the 2017 TT just finished, many riders are now turning their attention to Armoy and confirming their attendance.\nThe announcement was made at the official launch of the Roadside Kia \u2018Race of Legends\u2019, which was held at Gracehill House, Stranocum yesterday alongside a keynote presentation from David Wallace, the film producer of Road Racers and a local Dunloy man.\nThis year is the 40th anniversary of the original 1977 documentary, which truly captured the heady mixture of three local men, their families and their passion, drive and love of road racing.\nHe gave a short presentation on why and how the film was made but having won two BAFTAs for other work.\nSome key scenes of the film depict the three riders, Joey Dunlop, Mervyn Robinson and Frank Kennedy, riding through the village of Armoy where they often tested their bikes.\nBill Kennedy MBE, Chairman and Clerk of the Course, AMRRC said: \u201cWe are delighted to host, film producer and local man, David Wallace. It is difficult to comprehend that this film, Road Racers, was made 40 years ago, let alone the impact this film would have in years to come, the place it has in people\u2019s hearts and the iconic level that it has reached across the whole road racing community.\n\u201cThe Armoy Road Races came about as most of you know, after a bit of craic in a local pub. It\u2019s hard to believe come September that we will be in our tenth year and that we continue to celebrate all of our road racers, past and present, including the reputed Armoy Armada.\n\u201cIt is also hard to be believe how exceptionally fast 2017 is disappearing but we are on target with our planning. With additional monies from the Department of Communities and some work on the roads, courtesy of Transport NI, these races are set to be one of the best.\n\u201cWilliam Dunlop was man of the meeting in 2016 and I\u2019ve no doubt he will be keen to revisit his Armoy winning streak. As of yet, brother, Michael Dunlop, who retains the title of Race of Legends winner, having won in six successive years has yet to confirm his entry but the Club is hopeful he will race on his home course come July.\nAlso in attendance were the Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, Councillor Joan Baird, Terence Brannigan, Chairman of Tourism Northern Ireland, members of the Armoy Club and other guests and sponsors including title &apos;Race of Legends&apos; sponsor, Roadside Kia.\nTerence Brannigan, Tourism NI Chairman also commented: \u201cArmoy Road Races are one of Northern Ireland\u2019s prime motorsport gatherings, attracting motorcycle riders and spectators both locally and internationally.\n\"As the event goes from strength to strength it has an important role to play in tourism, in contributing to the economy and in enhancing our reputation as a destination.\nBill Kennedy concluded: \u201cI\u2019d like to finish by thanking event sponsors Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council and Tourism NI for their very kind support.\n\"I\u2019d also like to thank our title sponsor Roadside Kia. Without the support and sponsorship from these organisations and other sponsors present here today, the event just wouldn\u2019t be possible.\nThis year, Bike Week runs from Sunday July 23 until Saturday July 29 with the races taking place on Friday, July 28 and Saturday, July 29 culminating in the Roadside Kia \u2018Race of Legends\u2019.\nThe Armoy Road Races are part funded by Tourism Northern Ireland and the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T15:56:06Z", "url": "https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/sport/other-sport/leading-isle-man-tt-newcomer-13222622", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "President Donald Trump returned to Washington, DC on Monday for a very important event.\nIt was not for a meeting with an international leader.\nAnd it was not for a joint session of Congress.\nNo, on this day, Trump greeted thousands of children. They had come to the White House for the annual Easter Egg Roll.\nThe event has been a U.S. tradition for more than a century. In the late 1800s, local children gathered on the hill beside the president\u2019s house to play a game with their colored eggs following the Easter holiday.\nThe White House Easter Egg Roll was of special interest this year. The Trump administration was very late to organize it. Some people who hoped to attend the event were even worried that it would be canceled.\nPolitical observers said the Easter Egg Roll would show how well Trump\u2019s administration could plan and operate a complex public relations event.\nTalk about the event also brought attention to the first lady, whose office usually plans the White House Easter Egg Roll. First Lady Melania Trump has not yet moved to Washington, DC. She says she will remain in New York City until her son finishes the school year.\nSo, how did the White House Easter Egg Roll go this year?\nJust fine, early reports say.\nAbout 21,000 children and their families received tickets to this year\u2019s event. They came in small groups to the lawn near the president\u2019s house. They played soccer, tossed bean bags and, of course, pushed hard-boiled eggs down the hill.\nThe event was smaller than in previous years. Last year, for example, about 36,000 people attended.\nThis year\u2019s Easter Egg Roll also did not include performances by top celebrities or professional athletes. Instead, children were invited to draw pictures for U.S. soldiers.\nThe Easter Bunny made an appearance, though, as did both Trump and the first lady. They were there with their 11-year-old son, Barron. The president welcomed his young guests and promised them that the nation was getting stronger, bigger, and better.\nKelly Jean Kelly wrote this story for Learning English.

{"text": "Cosmetic surgery has become increasingly popular in the UK over the last ten years. Social media and cosmetically-enhanced reality TV stars, on shows such as Made in Chelsea and The Only Way is Essex, have undoubtedly played a key part in influencing this trend.\nCosmetic surgery is \u201cthe choice to undergo an operation, or invasive medical procedure, to alter one\u2019s physical appearance for aesthetic rather than medical reason\u201d \u2013 according to the Royal College of Surgeons.\nGone is the hiding of the shame of enhancements, like generations before. Now, a new group of cosmetic surgery patients are developing, with botox parties becoming a social norm.\nIn 2015 the UK market for cosmetic procedures was estimated to be worth as much as \u00a33.6bn and is anticipated to have risen sharply since.\nFor ladies, the most popular cosmetic surgery procedure is breast augmentation \u2013 accounting for around 30% of procedures performed. Other popular choices include blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery), breast reduction, neck and face lift, liposuction, abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) and rhinoplasty (nose job).\nFor men, facial surgery, and brow and eyelid lifts are the most common procedures performed.\nThe multi-million pound cosmetic industry, though, is one of the least regulated.\nReputable cosmetic and plastic surgeons often work in the public and private sectors, with many belonging to professional organisations, such as the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS). Here, all members belong to the Specialist Register of Plastic Surgeons, maintained by the General Medical Council (GMC).\nThere are also practitioners in the field with no formal training or certification, and this is causing serious concern.\nNegligent surgery or treatment performed without the necessary care or skill can result in physical or psychological damage and have a devastating effect. As a result, you may require further surgery or treatment, or you may be left with permanent scarring, causing cosmetic disfigurement.\nIf you are unhappy with the service provided, or you have suffered from ongoing pain and problems since your cosmetic surgery, you may have a case for Medical Negligence.\nOur nationally recognised expert solicitors at Osborne Morris & Morgan are only too aware of the serious effects of cosmetic surgery errors and are committed to helping those who have suffered as a result of poor treatment.\nTo arrange a free initial consultation with one of our Medical Negligence specialist solicitors, please call us on 01525 378177 or contact us online.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T20:30:36Z", "url": "https://www.ommlaw.co.uk/cosmetic-surgery-claims/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Bosch Security Systems was chosen as the central supplier for the security systems at Marmara Park Shopping Center in Istanbul, one of the largest of its kind in Turkey. The shopping center is completely designed in a galaxy-theme. Space-related lighting, planet models and a theme park for visitors form the individual identity of the shopping center. The networked and integrated security solution from Bosch comprises fire and voice evacuation systems, video surveillance, access control, and intrusion detection. All of these systems are centrally managed and operated via Bosch's Building Integration System.\nWith a total floor space of 100,000 square meters, 250 individual shops and restaurants, a hypermarket, a cinema complex and parking for 4,000 cars, Marmara Park serves approximately 40,000 customers per day. More than 2,400 jobs were created within the shopping center developed by ECE T\u00fcrkiye. In 2013 it was awarded the MIPIM award in the shopping center category, one of the world's most prestigious awards in real estate development.\nTo enable the highest security level for customers, employees and suppliers of Marmara Park, local Bosch partner Entegre designed a highly modular and scalable security system that meets all the standards as set in norm EN54. The Bosch fire alarm system consists of four networked Modular Fire Panel 5000 Series with 59 loops supporting more than 5,000 fire detectors. It is tightly integrated with the Bosch PRAESIDEO voice evacuation system which can also be used for announcements and background music in normal operations. This system with 64 amplifiers supports 140 independent zones, allowing targeted messaging in case of an evacuation.\nVideo surveillance of the entire premises has been realized using almost 300 cameras and 18 digital video recorders. In addition, Entegre installed a comprehensive access control system for non-public areas within the centre as well as the addressable intrusion detection system Modular Alarm Platform MAP 5000 from Bosch with more than 1,000 detectors. This allows the operator to exactly locate every alarm in real time, enabling fast response to any incident. The same holds true for the panic buttons which have been installed in all of the shops.\nBeing a tightly integrated solution, the entire security system can be configured and operated very efficiently from one central location or distributed consoles.

No surprise there I guess!\nI know, she\u2019s going to make someone a perfect family pet. I hope she finds a new home soon, I know there\u2019s a great family out there looking for a nice relaxed companion.\nWith a sweet name like Bambi how can you go wrong? I hope she finds a home soon.\nI also regret not getting any before photos of Laika. I was way to excited as well and just got her out of there without thinking about taking a photo.\nOh she is such a beauty! Know she\u2019ll find her home quickly! Looks like Jackson was one lucky fellow!\nIT is great to read that Bambi has many skills that will help her get adopted. Add her training to that adorable face and should should find a home soon. Also, thanks for the before and after shots. I love that idea.\nI love what this rescue is doing by featuring adult dogs that are perfect for families or first time dog owners. It\u2019s something that\u2019s needed in this area considering we have so many shelters around here that do their best to make great matches \u2013 but they don\u2019t have the resources to have them in foster homes to gain that better knowledge of a dogs personality.\nLOVE that before and after shot!!!!\nAnd Bambi is such a sweetheart! Paws crossed for her.\nI sure hope Bambi finds a great home!\nShe is beautiful! Hope she finds a home soon! Love the before and after picture of Jackson! Good for him!!!! Bambi has been shared!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T16:07:26Z", "url": "https://www.puppyleaks.com/laid-back-family-dog-bambi/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The graph may present some impossible and improbably sharp spikes, which should be ignored.\nGetting there: To approach from the northern side, the pass can be accessed off the R407 about 4 km south of Prince Albert. It is clearly signposted and easy to locate. Head south on the R328 for 2,3 km where the road crosses the Dorpsarivier via a concrete bridge. This point marks the northern start of the Swartberg Pass. This is the direction in which we filmed the pass.\nEerste Water in the northern sector of the pass makes for a perfect spot / Photo: Trygve RobertsFor those wanting to approach from the south, there are a number of options, but we will describe here the obvious main route. Drive north from Oudsthoorn on the tarred R328 via Schoemanskloof. Just after the Wilgewandel Guest Farm (with the camels) there is a fork in the road. The right hand fork heads directly to the Cango Caves. Turn left here (GPS S33.402020 E22.216309) The road (still tarred) heads east for a further 13 km where another guest farm is reached called 'Cobus se Gat'. This marks the southern start of the pass. The road becomes gravel after a further 2 km.\nThe nearest town is Prince Albert - just 4 km from the northern end of the pass. There is plenty see, from flora to fauna, and some mind boggling geology. The fynbos is at its best in winter and spring with proteas, ericas, restios and pin-cushions in profusion.\nThe pass is a national monument and, like its sister pass (Montagu Pass), stands in proud defiance of modern technology. It would be a shame if these roads were ever tarred as their core charm would be lost forever. A plaque commerorating the efforts of the men who built the pass was unveiled on the pass's centenary celebrations in 1988. It stands at the western side of the road at the summit. This was the last pass that Thomas Bain built in the Cape and it was surely his opus magnum. The final cost of the pass, including a few kilometers of access roads, was 14,500 Pounds Sterling, excluding the value of the convict labour, which was free.\nFrom the northern start at the crossing of the Dorpsrivier, the road traverses a short stretch of open plain, but the massive bulk of the looming Swartberg blocks the way ahead, other than a single, narrow gorge through which the road winds. The highest peak visible at this stage is unnamed at 1532m on your left (east), whilst the slightly lower Voetpadsberg on the right (west) tops out at 1402m.\nAmazing geology on display in the northern sector / Photo: Trygve RobertsA low dry packed wall appears on the left as the mountains begin hemming the river and the road in. These walls are the first of hundreds of such examples that you will see along the length of the pass. They were the work of Thomas Bain, then at the height of his engineering prowess as a road builder. The small river, which appears as a docile litlle stream, becomes a raging and destructive torrent when flash floods occur.\nDuring the night of April 10th, 2017, such a flash flood, swept down the kloof, destroying everything in it's path. Thomas Bain's retaining walls, which had been standing guard against the river for 130 years, buckled under the might of the river and the 2 km section of road from Malvadraai through to the northern exit of the poort were completely devastated. It took modern equipment and techniques almost 10 months to repair most of the damage, taking due care to rebuild the wallls to appear as close to Bain's original work as possible.\nThe Swartberg Nature Reserve is large - (180,000 hectares) and provides hiking, picnicking, 4x4 routes, bird-watching, swimming and just being close to nature.\nThe majority of the pass falls within the control of the Swartberg Nature Reserve / Photo: SA VenuesThe moment the kloof is entered, the sunlight is blocked off and the mountains tower vertically up on either side of the road in a dazzling display of contorted sandstone. The rocks often appear blood red, depending on the time of day. The photographic opportunities are endless and there are enough places to pull off the narrow roadway and park safely.\nSome bluegum trees appear on the left and a clearing pops up on the right - a large flat clearing where some ruins are evident. Apparently the house was used by Bain as a work station during the construction phase. Immediately after the clearing, the road bends sharply to the left and approaches the second river crossing via a concreted drift. This is normally shallow and should present no problems for any vehicle. This lovely spot is known as Eerste Water (First Water) and was the first point where oxen and horses could be watered, before tackling the big climb to the summit. There is a rock near this spot - a tall thin slab of rock, which looks like a clock. There is lots of shade at this spot and it makes for a great picnic spot and is well protetcted from the wind too.\nThe pass in the 1800's with its designer - Thomas Bain / Photo: Swartberg Mountain ToursOnce over the river, the road bends to the right and follows the eastern bank of the river. The road has been hewn out of the mountain here and is very narrow. If you meet an approaching vehicle, one of you will need to reverse to a wider section to facilitate passing.\nSoon the road crosses the river for a third time, this time via a low level concrete bridge, which is called Tweede Water (Second Water). Around the next corner is another excellent picnic spot, named Malvadraai. (Wild Geranium Corner) - so named for the wild geraniums that grow there. The section from Tweede Water to Malvadraai also got severely damaged during the 2017 flood.\nOn the left hand side (east) of the river, you will notice a footpath snaking up the mountain-side towards a saddle. This is the 6 hour Malvadraai Hiking Trail and is apparently a lot tougher than its gentle name suggests. Malvadraai is a rest area next to the river, where one normally finds wild geraniums at any time of the year. The river is spotlessly clean and this is a good spot to have a swim on a hot summers day.\nThe road now enters a series of S-bends, and swings away into the south-west up a major kloof, known as Mullers Kloof. This kloof also gave Bain the most trouble. In May 1885 a devastating flood swept across the Swartberg Mountains, washing away most of the road in the adjacent Meiringspoort and causing a long closure. Bains' brand new road also suffered damage, but Bain learned his lessons well and rebuilt the damaged sections of road further away from the river's flood levels.\nThe road also begins climbing more steeply here, reaching a gradient of 1:9. At the 4,4 km mark, there is a layby on the right, which allows access to the ruins, marked as Blikstasie. These ruins were once the convicts home, who constructed the pass.\nAccess to the ruins is awkward and requires some physical effort. Shrubs and trees have overgrown the ruins, but if you have the physical capacity to scramble the few metres up the slope, you will be rewarded with a perfect view of the old walls. These are approximately 2ft thick and consist of rocks and stones held together by mud. The building apparently had an iron roof, hence the name Blikstasie (Tin Station).\nFrom the ruins, if you look up the slope to the left of the road, you will get perfect views of the massive retaing walls that support the road ascending up Mullers Kloof. These are the most impressive of all the walls and at places reach a height of 13 metres! This is also the kloof that was featured in the TV commercial with well known South African singer, song-writer, playwright and actor - David Kramer, chasing his beloved Volksie Bus up one of the hairpins in his trademark red \"veldskoens\".\nThe road climbs steeply into the south-west towards a huge slab of exposed and contorted rockface. It is marked as Droe Waterval (Dry Waterfall) as most of the year this riivulet is without water. If you get to drive this pass around sunset, this rock face glows a deep and fiery red in the setting sun and has earned itself the nickname of \"Wall of Fire\"\nHere you are likely to see baboons and klipspringers, the latter which seem to float up the mountainside with no apparent effort.\nIf you have the time, you will see that as part Bain's dry-walled roads, he constructed underground tunnels to disperse flood waters. The man was a genius and way ahead of his time. An example of this work can still be seen at the \"Droe Waterfall\" which is mostly just a trickle (and aptly named), but when the heavy rains arrive, the gorge is filled with a destructive torrent of white water, capable of sweeping away even the largest of rocks.\nAt Droe Waterval the road curves sharply through 120 degrees to the left and climbs steeply in the process, reaching a gradient of 1:8. Coming up are the famous four hairpins that feature in so many photos of the Swartberg Pass. Drive slowly and carefully and be constantly aware of approaching traffic as the road is narrow here and both vehicles will need to move as far left as possible and pass each other at a crawling speed. Some drivers get so engrossed in the scenery that they forget to keep left. Be constantly aware of meeting an oncoming vehicle on the wrong side of the road.\nThere aren't many places to pull over safely, but there is one good spot right before the third hairpin, which allows a wide scope for photography. It's a great spot to stop and breathe in the clear mountain air and savour the majesty of the impressive landscape. This is one of the Top 5 highlights of the Swartberg Pass.\nOnce up onto the ridge, the gradient eases off a bit to around 1:14 and follows the spine of a long ridge, as the road climbs inexorably towards the viewsite known as Teeberg. The road is wider here and passing oncoming traffic is easier. The Teeberg viewsite is located at the apex of a very sharp right hand bend of 160 degrees. It's at an altutude of 1394m exactly 9 km from the northern start. There is a concrete picnic table here and sufficient parking for about 6 vehicles.\nThe name Teeberg does not appear on any of the topographical maps and the mountain spine that leads upwards terminates at 1535m and is actually called Platberg.\nLooking north one gets a majestic view over the 500m deep chasm that runs all the way down to Malvadraai. The views are quite amazing and if you arrive at this view site on a wind free day, it is a marvellous place to find your soul. The views are 360 degrees and offer so much variety that it's almost impossible to take it all in.\nCautionary: There have been a few incidents on this pass, where people have left there vehicles to take a photograph and not fully applied the handbrake and in one instance, not at all.\nA minivan rolled almost 400m down the cliffs and was obviously a total write-off. Luckily the occupants were out of the vehicle at the time. When stopping at any of the viewsites, it is best practice to switch the engine off, engage 1st or reverse gear if manual, and PARK if automatic PLUS fully apply the handbrake.\nThere are baboons, grysbok, grey rhebuck, klipsringer, leopards and caracal - with the last two seldom being sighted. The road is narrow in certain sections and some reversing might be required to get past an oncoming vehicle. Etiquette is to give way to the ascending vehicle. There are no heavy vehicles or caravans allowed.\nDrive at the speed limit or slower - this road can be dangerous in bad weather. If you plan on stopping at the top for a photo or two, have a windbreaker ready - it can be ice cold out of the car and almost always windy.\nFrom Teeberg the road heads due west as it skirts a side ravine and maintains a fairly level altitude. At the 9,9 km mark, there is a sharp left hand bend, which changes the direction into the SSE, as a flatter section of the upper plateau is traversed. Here the mountain slopes are covered in dense stands of proteas and ericas and if you visit in winter or spring, you will be richly rewarded.\nThe road starts climbing again at a gradient of 1:16 and an intersection is reached at the 10,8 km mark, with another gravel road heading away into the west. This is the turn-off to the famous Gamkaskloof . It is not recommended to drive this road unless you are well prepared, have sufficient fuel, knowledge, and preferably have booked accommodation overnight at Die Hel. This road is slow and a lot rougher than the Swartberg Pass.\nCAUTIONARY: Do not drive this road (Gamkaskloof/Die Hel) unless you have a high clearance vehicle and preferably a 4x4. It is a minimum of a 4 hour trip there and back excluding any stops. It is far better to prebook accommodation at Die Hel and overnight there. The road is a dead-end and consists of about 9 small passes and one big one at the end (Elands Pass). You will be doing this route an injustice by attempting to drive it in a single day. This road is much rougher than the Swartberg Pass.\nSign at the summit now obliterated with stickers / Photo: Sncdn.comAfter negotiating another big right hand bend of 140 degrees and at the 10,8 km mark, the buildings of the old toll house and Swartberg Nature Reserve appear at the next bend. These are used by hikers tackling the Swartberg Hiking Trail.\nThe road now swings through another big S-bend which brings the heading into the east, as the next set of switchbacks begins at the 12,4 km point.\nYou will also notice a locked and gated jeep track heading eastwards just after the picnic spot. This is a known 4x4 route which is some 75 km long. Permits can be obtained from Cape Nature and/or the Swartberg Nature Reserve. There is a minimum number of vehicles required per trip for safety reasons. Immediately before the jeep track junction, some green roofed buildings appear on the left of the road, almost directly below the pass summit. This was originally the site of the road camp where the convicts were housed and perished that snowy night 120 years ago, when their roof caved in. Today, the buildings have been restored and serve as an information centre for the Swartberg Nature Reserve, as well as an overnight hikers hut and a tearoom.\nThe next set of switchbacks consists of four hairpins and whilst they are most impressive, they are not quite in the league of those in Mullers Kloof. The road is also not so narrow and there are more opportunities to stop for sight seeing and photography.\nLooking south from the summit of the pass / Photo: BlogsausbettiesThe third hairpin changes the heading into the west, as the final pull up to the 1575m summit is tackled. Be prepared for cold, blustery conditions at the summit and be aware that there is limited parking. A sticker plastered sign announces: '\"DIE TOP\". This is not the optimum view site on the pass and the weather often spoils things as the wind can really howl through the neck, often reaching gale force conditions. It is much better to stop at one of the three viewsites along the southern descent.\nFrom Die Top, which is a natural saddle in the mountain, you will have expansive views to the south of most of the Klein Karoo, with it's patchwork of green farmlands, whilst the northern vista is entirely different, displaying much drier mountains with a massive gorge splitting the upper mountain plateau into two. It is along the western side of this gorge, that the road has delivered you. From the summit point, the road can be visually traced all the way back to Teeberg. If you are lucky enough to be at the summit alone, switch your car's engine off and listen to the incredible silence or the wind whistling past the rocks at Die Top.\nThe moment the road curves through the sharp left hander at the summit, huge views of green fields and distant grey mountains open up. It is completely different to what has been on offer for the previous 40 minutes. All along the descent there are wonderful examples of Thomas Bain's perfectly constructed dry packed walls.\nPerfect examples of the dry packed supporting walls on the southern side / Photo: PanoramioThe descent is mainly into the east and other than dozens of bends, corners and curves, this direction is maintaned all the way to the valley floor. Maintain a slow and steady speed and make sure you keep well left on all the blind corners.\nCAUTIONARY: The Swartberg Pass is enormously popular with both local and international travellers as can be attested by the many hire cars that can be seen on the pass 7 days per week. Tourists tend to drift completely onto the wrong side of the road as they take in the grand scenery. On the day of filming we had two incidents where we would have had head on collisions, had we been driving faster. Be extra vigilant, blow your hooter as you enter a blind corner, drive with your headlights on and anticipate.\nThere are four view/picnic sites on the southern ascent. If you are planning a picnic, the lowest site might be the most pleasant, as there is nearly always strong wind and cooler temperatures near the summit. The descent lasts for 10,3 kms and should take about 20 minutes to drive excluding stops. Although the pass carries the route number R328 it's administrative number is P0369.\nThe second view site, named Skelmdraai is very good (if the wind is not blowing) with wonderful views and sufficient parking space for about 5 vehicles. From this site, there are excellent perspectives of Bain's propped up walls that run for 2,3 kilometres without a break.\nAt the 18 km mark, there is a substantial ruin on the left hand side of the road (north), followed soon by a big picnic and view site. This is the last view site along the descent, if you intend taking a break. There are another four hairpins coming up, which commence at a ruin called Stalletjie, followed in quick succession by Witdraai. These start at the 20,4 km mark.\nNear the southern end of the Swartberg Pass looking west/ Photo: Thorsten KuttigThe road begins flattening out a little and the road surface improves as the foot of the pass is approached. After the last hairpin (which clears a side ravine), the road changes direction into the south and the road surface switches to tar at the 23,3 km point. The descent gradient remains reasonable and soon a large guest farm makes its appearance on the right hand side, which is Cobus se Gat. This is a good place to get some refreshment, reinflate your tyres and savour all the wonderful memories of driving the amazing Swartberg Pass.\nAs you exit the final section of the pass and access the tar, you will be left with a feeling of awe, relief and disappointment all in one. Relief that you made it through without mishap and disappointment that it's all over. This pass ranks amongst the top 10 South African passes in terms of the total package. There are others which are higher, longer, sharper, more dangerous, but there is only one Swartberg Pass. This is the one pass you must experience at least once in your lifetime.\nIt leaves one with the sense that those responsible for naming the various points up the pass, had exhausted their creative energies by the time they reached the summit (1575m ASL) as the best name they could come up with was Die Top. It must have been a monumental effort.\nThe pass is a national monument / Photo: GoogleHistory: Thomas Bain, with the help of some 250 convict labourers built the pass from 1883 to 1886. He managed to keep the gradient lower than 1:8 throughout the pass, compared to the steeper 1:6 of the Montagu Pass. Bain cleverly used the ridges of the foothills for a comfortable 'altitude gaining' approach to the looming bulk of the Swartberg range, where he chose the lowest saddle as his target.\nIt was tough going and there are many stories that abound about the hardships endured by these pioneering men. When the crest of the pass had been reached during the second winter, a road builders camp had been set up close to the summit. After a particularly heavy snowfall, the roof of the camp collapsed, killing several of the convicts.\nBy this stage of his road building career Bain had developed several unique techniques employing his knowledge of science. One was his dry-walling construction using the principles of cohesion and friction, using no cement at all. This technique was first brought into South Africa by John Montagu and Charles Michell and the first known examples of dry walling to support roads dates to the Montagu Pass (built by Michell) and Bainskloof (built by Thomas Bain's father, Andrew Bain).\nThe other was using heat and water to break big rocks up. A large fire would be lit under or near a difficult rock and then cold water would be poured over it, resulting in the rock cracking into smaller, more manageable pieces. Thomas acquired most of these skills from his father, (and to whom he was apprenticed for a several years), who had an intimate understanding of geology. In these early pioneering days, the tools employed were very rudimentary and consisted primarily of picks, shovels, sledgehammers, gunpowder and hard labour.\nZoom in and out; rotate in any direction.\nUse the Get Route'feature (directly beneath the map): type in your address to get a personalised route straight from where you are to the pass, with time and distance included.\nDetailed written and printable directions.\nDrag the 'little orange man' icon onto the pass for a complete 360\u00b0 tiltable \"street view\".", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T12:22:36Z", "url": "https://mountainpassessouthafrica.co.za/find-a-pass/western-cape/item/126-swartberg-pass-part-1.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "So you might ask yourself, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d How can things be so bad that educators feel the need to petition?\nSuperintendent Michael Hanson\u2019s administration issued a mandate to all school principals, vice principals and counselors to lower the number of suspensions and expulsions districtwide using a repackaged, rhetoric-filled behavioral modification program called Restorative Justice.\nThis Restorative Justice concept is not new. These interventions usually fail under the weight of their overexaggerated promises. This leads to an odd belief that if you decrease the number of official suspensions on paper, you can claim success regarding improved behavior.\nFresno Unified board member Christopher De La Cerda, McLane\u2019s representative, highlighted this delusion when he stated, \u201cThe data confirms that restorative practices at McLane are working as we intended it to work.\u201d Sort of like bragging that no one drowned in the pool after the water was removed.\nIf the intention was for more than 80 percent of the teaching staff to be so fed up they needed to file a petition \u2013 congratulations! Mission accomplished.\nThe saddest part of this debacle is that it has ironically resulted in increased insecurity and systemic violence for our teachers and students who truly want to be educated.\nBut here is the most disappointing fact: This situation did not need to happen; it was self-inflicted.\nThree years ago, there was a wonderful, accredited, academic program in Fresno Unified that took in up to 1,600 secondary students a year, who either could not \u2013 or should not \u2013 attend a traditional high school.\nThis program was a last-chance beacon of hope for thousands of students who, by their own fault or the fault of others, would have had no real chance of graduating from high school. It was called the J.E.Young Academic Center (JEY). It provided an educational sanctuary for the very students FUSD is trying to corral with this Restorative Justice debacle.\nEvery student was treated \u2013 educationally and emotionally \u2013 as a unique individual. JEY accepted the entire spectrum of students; from those whose special needs could not be adequately met, to those whose behaviors could not be adequately accommodated on a traditional high school campus. This program was an oasis for students on the precipice of failure.\nIt was a wonderful independent study program that served the needs of those most in need. Everybody won. But that didn\u2019t matter.\nFor spurious and ego-driven reasons, this program was dismantled and diminished to a mere shell of its former self. It was replaced by a program that failed after two years. Like prisons, it involves removing those in society with unacceptable behaviors and placing them into a concentrated environment of only themselves.\nIf shooting oneself in the foot was considered a good thing, then FUSD could qualify as a world-class marksman regarding this issue.

{"text": "Decreasing biodiversity in an ecosystem can increase the spread of disease, research suggests. Researchers studying amphibian communities in natural wetland ecosystems as well as controlled experiments have shown that as diversity increased, infection rates dropped.\nThe rate of extinction of species is increasing as ecosystems across the world come under pressure from habitat loss, pollution and climate change. Recently, changes in biodiversity have been linked to changes in disease risk for humans and wildlife.\nIn the last ten years, a number of studies have reported a correlation between the species diversity within a community and the ability of diseases to spread among that community. This is because some pathogens, i.e. infectious viruses or bacteria, can infect many different species, which differ in their ability to pass on the disease. The authors of this study set out to test the underlying connection between biodiversity and disease prevalence.\nOver three years, they observed the spread of Ribeiroia ondatrae, a pathogen that causes severe deformities and death in amphibians, within 345 wetland ecosystems across a 758,100-hectare region of California, USA.\nA total of 24,215 amphibians were assessed for deformities. In wetlands with low species diversity, the proportion of amphibians carrying and passing on the pathogen was much higher than in those wetlands with a more diverse composition of species. The greater the diversity of species in the wetland ecosystems studied, the higher the number of species more resistant to the pathogen.\nTransmission of the pathogen was 78.4% lower in the in the most species-diverse wetland communities, compared with the least species-diverse. Under laboratory conditions, the researchers observed a 64% decrease in pathogen transmission and infection when the number of species in a controlled community was increased from one to three. In a further experiment using an outdoor, artificially assembled community, total infection rates decreased by 50% when the number of species present was increased from one to four.\nThe study provides evidence of a link between biodiversity and the spread of disease. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that there is plenty of evidence to show that populations with little biodiversity, such as monocultures, facilitate the spread of disease. However, the authors also caution that many other environmental factors, including resource availability, climate and habitat variables will interact to affect the rate of spread of disease within a community.\nThe authors conclude higher levels of biodiversity could help to increase the resilience of wildlife, domestic plants and animals and humans to disease. Conservation efforts should aim to protect and enhance genetic and species diversity as a novel and cost-effective tool in the management of the spread of disease.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T09:07:43Z", "url": "http://www.sustainapedia.com/increase-biodiversity-decrease-the-spread-of-disease/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Posted by: ashleyn002@gmail.com, on 1/26/2017, in category \"General news & articles\"\nPipes carry many types of fluids including liquids and gases from one location to another. Piping systems are often designed for extreme high or low temperatures. However, both hot and cold applications will expand and contract with an increase or decrease in temperature. Installing expansion joints in a piping system prevents thermal expansion from creating high stresses that could cause cracking welds, bending pipes and failing anchors. Composition and Function: Expansion joints are constructed with metal bellows or Teflon, end fittings and accessories such as flow liners, tie rods, and protective shrouds. Most expansion joints are made up of several coils designed to withstand the internal pressure of the system. The common bellows assembly is positioned to flex under the thermal movement of the connected piping. Expansion joints are able to absorb any longitudinal loads as a result of extreme flexibility. To maintain the overall stability of the whole piping system while transferring longitudinal loads, it is necessary to install piping anchors and guides. Thermal Expansion and Placement: Pipes are not an exception when it comes to expansion and contraction with hot and cold temperatures. Piping engineers are able to determine the rate of expansion resulting from the materials and temperatures used for the specific application. After the amount of expansion is known, locations of expansion joints, anchors and guides can be determined and installed. If you are considering expansion joints for a piping system and need assistance with selection or ordering, contact our team at MKS.

When hot it is an oxidizing agent, the sulfur in it being reduced; sulfur dioxide gas may be released. Hot concentrated sulfuric acid reacts with most metals and with several nonmetals, e.g., sulfur and carbon. Because the concentrated acid has a fairly high boiling point, it can be used to release more volatile acids from their salts, e.g., when sodium chloride (NaCl), or common salt, is heated with concentrated sulfuric acid, hydrogen chloride gas, HCl, is evolved.\nConcentrated sulfuric acid has a very strong affinity for water. It is sometimes used as a drying agent and can be used to dehydrate (chemically remove water from) many compounds, e.g., carbohydrates. It reacts with the sugar sucrose, C12H22O11, removing eleven molecules of water, H2O, from each molecule of sucrose and leaving a brittle spongy black mass of carbon and diluted sulfuric acid. The acid reacts similarly with skin, cellulose, and other plant and animal matter.\nWhen the concentrated acid mixes with water, large amounts of heat are released; enough heat can be released at once to boil the water and spatter the acid.

Since it is dibasic (i.e., it has two replaceable hydrogen atoms in each molecule), it forms both normal sulfates (with both hydrogens replaced, e.g., sodium sulfate, Na2SO4) and acid sulfates, also called bisulfates or hydrogen sulfates (with only one hydrogen replaced, e.g., sodium bisulfate, NaHSO4).\nchemical compound, SO2, a colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor.

The sulfur dioxide is obtained by burning sulfur, by burning pyrites (iron sulfides), by roasting nonferrous sulfide ores preparatory to smelting, or by burning hydrogen sulfide gas. Some sulfuric acid is also made from ferrous sulfate waste solutions from pickling iron and steel and from waste acid sludge from oil refineries.\nIn the lead chamber process hot sulfur dioxide gas enters the bottom of a reactor called a Glover tower where it is washed with nitrous vitriol (sulfuric acid with nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2, dissolved in it) and mixed with nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide gases; some of the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide and dissolved in the acid wash to form tower acid or Glover acid (about 78% H2SO4). From the Glover tower a mixture of gases (including sulfur dioxide and trioxide, nitrogen oxides, nitrogen, oxygen, and steam) is transferred to a lead-lined chamber where it is reacted with more water. The chamber may be a large, boxlike room or an enclosure in the form of a truncated cone. Sulfuric acid is formed by a complex series of reactions; it condenses on the walls and collects on the floor of the chamber. There may be from three to twelve chambers in a series; the gases pass through each in succession. The acid produced in the chambers, often called chamber acid or fertilizer acid, contains 62% to 68% H2SO4. After the gases have passed through the chambers they are passed into a reactor called the Gay-Lussac tower where they are washed with cooled concentrated acid (from the Glover tower); the nitrogen oxides and unreacted sulfur dioxide dissolve in the acid to form the nitrous vitriol used in the Glover tower. Remaining waste gases are usually discharged into the atmosphere.\nIn the contact process, purified sulfur dioxide and air are mixed, heated to about 450\u00b0C;, and passed over a catalyst; the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide. The catalyst is usually platinum on a silica or asbestos carrier or vanadium pentoxide on a silica carrier. The sulfur trioxide is cooled and passed through two towers. In the first tower it is washed with oleum (fuming sulfuric acid, 100% sulfuric acid with sulfur trioxide dissolved in it). In the second tower it is washed with 97% sulfuric acid; 98% sulfuric acid is usually produced in this tower. Waste gases are usually discharged into the atmosphere. Acid of any desired concentration may be produced by mixing or diluting the products of this process.\nSulfuric acid is one of the most important industrial chemicals. More of it is made each year than is made of any other manufactured chemical; more than 40 million tons of it were produced in the United States in 1990. It has widely varied uses and plays some part in the production of nearly all manufactured goods. The major use of sulfuric acid is in the production of fertilizers, e.g., superphosphate of lime and ammonium sulfate. It is widely used in the manufacture of chemicals, e.g., in making hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfate salts, synthetic detergents, dyes and pigments, explosives, and drugs. It is used in petroleum refining to wash impurities out of gasoline and other refinery products. Sulfuric acid is used in processing metals, e.g., in pickling (cleaning) iron and steel before plating them with tin or zinc. Rayon is made with sulfuric acid. It serves as the electrolyte in the lead-acid storage battery commonly used in motor vehicles (acid for this use, containing about 33% H2SO4 and with specific gravity about 1.25, is often called battery acid).\nAlthough sulfuric acid is now one of the most widely used chemicals, it was probably little known before the 16th cent. It was prepared by Johann Van Helmont (c.1600) by destructive distillation of green vitriol (ferrous sulfate) and by burning sulfur. The first major industrial demand for sulfuric acid was the Leblanc process for making sodium carbonate (developed c.1790). Sulfuric acid was produced at Nordhausen from green vitriol but was expensive. A process for its synthesis by burning sulfur with saltpeter (potassium nitrate) was first used by Johann Glauber in the 17th cent. and developed commercially by Joshua Ward in England c.1740. It was soon superseded by the lead chamber process, invented by John Roebuck in 1746 and since improved by many others. The contact process was originally developed c.1830 by Peregrine Phillips in England; it was little used until a need for concentrated acid arose, particularly for the manufacture of synthetic organic dyes.\nH2 SO4, a strong dibasic acid corresponding to the highest oxidation state of sulfur (+ 6). Under usual conditions, sulfuric acid is a heavy, oily, colorless, and odorless liquid. In industry, mixtures of sulfuric acid both with water and sulfur trioxide are also called sulfuric acid. If the SO3: H2 O molecular ratio is less than 1, the mixture is an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid; if it is more than 1, the mixture is a solution of SO3 in sulfuric acid.\nThe compounds H2 SO4\u00b7SO3 (H2 S2 O7, disulfuric, or pyrosulfuric acid, mp 35.15\u00b0C) and H2 SO4\u00b72SO3 (H2 S3 O10, trisulfuric acid, mp 1.20\u00b0C) are also formed. Only water vapor is given off into the vapor phase upon heating and boiling aqueous solutions of sulfuric acid containing up to 70 percent H2 S04. Vapors of sulfuric acid are formed above more concentrated solutions. A solution of 98.3 percent H2 SO4 (azeotropic mixture) upon boiling (336.5\u00b0C) is completely distilled. Sulfuric acid containing more than 98.3 percent H2 SO4 releases vapors of SO3 upon heating.\nSulfuric acid removes water that is chemically bound to organic compounds containing OH, or hydroxyl, groups. The dehydration of ethyl alcohol in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid results in the formation of ethylene or diethyl ether. The charring of sugar, cellulose, starch, and other carbohydrates upon contact with sulfuric acid also derives from the dehydration of these substances. As a dibasic acid, sulfuric acid forms two types of salts: sulfates and bisulfates.\nProduction. The first descriptions of oil of vitriol, that is, concentrated sulfuric acid, were given by the Italian scientist V. Biringuccio in 1540 and the German alchemist whose works were published under the name of Basilius Valentinus in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. By 1690, the French chemists N. Lemery and N. Lefebvre had laid the basis for the first industrial method of obtaining sulfuric acid, a method applied in England in 1740. According to this method, a mixture of sulfur and saltpeter was burned in a ladle suspended in a glass jar containing a certain amount of water. The SO3 generated reacted with the water to form sulfuric acid. In 1746, J. Roebuck in Birmingham replaced the glass jars with chambers made of sheet lead, thus laying the basis for the chamber process for the production of sulfuric acid. Continuous improvement in the process for the production of sulfuric acid in Great Britain and France resulted in 1908 in the first tower system. In the USSR, the first tower installation went into operation in 1926 at the Po-levskoi Metallurgical Plant in the Urals.\nThe raw material for the production of sulfuric acid can be sulfur, pyrite (FeS2), or exhaust gases containing SO2 from furnaces for the oxidative roasting of the sulfide ores of Cu, Pb, Zn, and other metals. In the USSR, most sulfuric acid is obtained from pyrite. Here, the FeS2 is burned in furnaces in the state of a fluidized bed, a state achieved by blowing a rapid stream of air through a layer of finely ground pyrite. The gaseous mixture obtained contains SO2, O2, N2, impurities of SO3, and vapors of H2 O, As2 O3, and SiO2 and holds considerable cinder dust, which is removed from the gas in electrostatic precipitators.\nThe NO produced is converted into N2 O3, or, more precisely, a mixture of NO and NO2, in the oxidizing tower. The gases are then introduced into absorption towers, where they encounter sulfuric acid supplied from the top. It is here that nitrous vitriol is obtained; the mixture is then transferred to the production towers. Thus, there is continuous production and a circulation of nitrogen oxides. The inevitable losses of nitrogen oxides with the exhaust gases are balanced by the addition of HNO3.\nThe sulfuric acid produced by the nitrous method is of insufficient concentration and contains harmful impurities, for example. As. Production is accompanied by the release of nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere (\u201cfoxtails,\u201d named for the color of NO2).\nDepending on the amount of water introduced into the process, either oleum or a solution of sulfuric acid in water is obtained.\nIn 1973 the production of sulfuric acid (in the monohydrate) was (in millions of tons): 14.9 in the USSR, 28.7 in the United States, 7.1 in Japan, 5.5 in the Federal Republic of Germany, 4.4 in France, 3.9 in Great Britain, 3.0 in Italy, 2.9 in Poland, 1.2 in Czechoslovakia, 1.1 in the German Democratic Republic, and 0.9 in Yugoslavia.\nUSE. Sulfuric acid is one of the most important products of the heavy chemical industry. The available grades include chamber acid (not less than 75 percent H2 SO4), oil of vitriol (not less than 92.5 percent), and oleum, or fuming sulfuric acid (a solution of 18.5\u201320 percent SO3 in H2 SO4), as well as especially pure battery acid (92\u201394 percent; when diluted by water to 26\u201331 percent, it serves as the electrolyte in lead batteries). In addition, reagent-grade sulfuric acid (92\u201394 percent) is produced by the contact process in quartz or platinum apparatus. The strength of sulfuric acid is determined by the density, which is measured with a hydrometer. Most of the chamber acid is used in the production of mineral fertilizers. Sulfuric acid is used in the production of, for example, phosphoric, hydrochloric, boric, and hydrofluoric acids because of its ability to displace these acids from their salts. Concentrated sulfuric acid is used in separating organosulfur compounds and unsaturated organic compounds from petroleum products. Dilute sulfuric acid is used for the removal of scale from wire and sheets before plating with tin or zinc and for the pickling of metal surfaces before plating with chromium, nickel, or copper. It is used in metallurgy for the decomposition of complex ores, in particular, those of uranium. In organic synthesis, concentrated sulfuric acid is a necessary component of nitrating mixtures and a sulfonating agent in the production of many dyes and pharmaceuticals. Owing to its high hygroscopicity, sulfuric acid is used in drying gases and in concentrating nitric acid.\nSafety measures. Poisonous gases\u2014SO2 and NO2\u2014as well as vapors of SO3 and H2 SO4, present a danger in the production of sulfuric acid. Proper ventilation and hermetically sealed production apparatus are therefore mandatory. Since sulfuric acid causes serious burns of the skin, handling requires extreme care and protective devices (goggles, rubber gloves, aprons, boots). When diluting sulfuric acid, the acid must be poured into water in a thin stream while stirring. Pouring the water into the acid leads to spattering because of the evolution of a great amount of heat.\nSpravochnik sernokislotchika, 2nd ed. Edited by K. M. Malin. Moscow, 1971.\nMalin, K. M., N.

Whilst there are 800m heats and Finals in the program, traditionally the 800m are straight finals (this will be decided on the day).\nPlease note that the times given are \u2018not before times\u2019 they are not competing times.\nThe first Marshalling call for field events will be at 8.10am on both days and athletes will proceed directly to their first field event to Marshall at the competition area.\nThe first Marshalling call on the Track event on both days will be 8.15am for both the circular and straight tracks.\nPlease check the times of your child\u2019s events carefully on the zone program. Field events are listed with a \u201cNot Before Time\u201d. This means that the event will not commence before that time, however it is likely to be marshalled in order to start at the \u201cNot Before Time\u201d. Track times are given down the side of the Track events \u2013 and the track usually runs to schedule. The only time in recent years that we have been late at a zone carnival was a thunder storm delay.\nEnsure you arrive 1 hour before your event, this will enable you to find parking, check in, set up your chairs etc and not be stressed. Your athlete will also have plenty of time to warm up prior to being marshalled.\nFootwear is compulsory for all athletes in all events. For safety reasons Spike shoes are only to be worn during events and must be removed before proceeding to another event.\nSpike shoes may not be worn for athletes in the Under 7, Under 8 and Under 9 age groups.\nSpike shoes may only be worn in track event run entirely in lanes for Under 10, Under 11 and Under 12 age groups.\nFor age groups between Under 13 and Under 17, spike shoes can be worn in all track events (except walks).\nSpike shoes may also be worn in Long Jump, Triple Jump, High Jump and Javelin where applicable in Under 10 to Under 17 age groups.\nA Maximum 12mm Grass spike may be used at Barton Park.\nPlease check in at your club\u2019s tent, so we know your child has arrived and that you have confirmed for your rostered duty.\nThere will be marshalling calls throughout the day on the loud speaker system. It is the parent\u2019s responsibility to warm up their children and to ensure athletes go to marshalling on time. If an athlete does not turn up for their event at marshalling, it runs without them and they miss out.\nWe would like to remind all parents / caregivers that we do require all children to be accompanied by an adult at the carnival. On arrival at the zone Carnival we would like to ask that one parent / caregiver sign in with their club and check that we have the correct contact details for the attending adult on the day in case of emergencies or any other need to contact you.\nAs the North Metropolitan Carnival is run entirely using volunteers, each club has been allocated a number of jobs.\nPlease sign up for your duties with your club to ensure the smooth running of the zone carnival.\nResults from all the track events are posted on the amenities block, by the canteen. Please check these lists to see if you are in a final.\nUnder 7 Athletes who place in the top three in any Final, will receive a medal in a special medal presentation. You are welcome to take photos of the athletes on the dias.\nAll athletes will receive a certificate detailing all their zone results early in the new year. Athletes from Under 8 to Under 17 who place in the top 6 in their Finals will qualify for Region Championships. Additionally following the completion of the North East Zone carnival, athletes who are the next best 4 athletes from either zone will achieve qualification to the region carnival. Athletes must be in the final to be a subsequent qualifier. All field events are straight finals. Pack starts, 800, 1500 and 3000 are also straight finals. Therefore if you finished 7th or 8th it is likely you will be an additional qualifier to Region and will be notified in early February by your Team Manager.\nThe first 3 relay teams will achieve qualification to region.\n1.

Make sure you have the right shoes. It is nearly impossible to loan shoes and athletes may not compete barefoot in any event.\n5. Something to sit on \u2013 there is no grandstand, so your own chairs, or groundsheet and possibly shade. Sit in your club area to form a cheer squad for other athletes in your club.\n6. Spray bottles and towels are also a good idea.\nBarton Park is a grass track, so may be affected by heavy rain. Any wet weather notification will be placed on the Parramatta Little Athletics web site www.plac.org.au . However if there is no website notice, all athletes should arrive at the carnival despite the weather and wait for a decision to be made, and this may involve a delayed start. In the event of wet weather please bring plenty of wet weather gear as the carnival is likely to proceed despite wet conditions. Barton Park has lights and so if the carnival is delayed it will proceed until finished in the evening.\nIf you know you cannot attend Region, please notify your team manager by the end of the zone carnival.

{"text": "Once in a while here at MBJD Laser we get a chance to do some R&D. (research and development). We have been wanting to do some vector cutting on some fun substrates and it has always intrigued me to try and laser cut Bicycle Playing Cards. Below are a couple picture examples of what we did.\nIts interesting the things you learn along the way as well. A few things to note: A standard deck of playing cards measures 3 1/2\" x 2 1/2\". There are 52 cards in a deck, or 54 if you count the 2 jokers. Our Epilog Zing 40 Watt laser took on average about 40 seconds to laser cut each card. In the examples shown we used Embassy Font. A couple reasons we used embassy font is that it has proven to us to be a popular font, but more importantly the cursive style font connects all the letters together allowing the name to be held in place once the laser cuts it out. As you can see in the photo we purposely attached the first and last letter to the frame of the card so that it would stay in place. (We did have to use a little AutoCAD magic to create the full affect) I'm sure our LXI sign software or Corel Draw could do the same thing.\nWe plan on offering custom laser cut decks of cards in our store soon. These would make great table decorations, novelty gifts, or just fun unique gifts for that hard to shop for person. They make great conversation pieces and fun room decor.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T12:44:39Z", "url": "https://www.mbjdlaser.com/blog/laser-cut-playing-cards", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "In 1980, Deng Xiaoping started China\u2019s first special-economic zone in a coastal village that was nothing to look at. Today, Shenzhen is a teeming collage of huge skyscrapers, thriving industrial parks, 10 million people, one of the world\u2019s busiest ports, and some of the biggest manufacturing and outsourcing industries anywhere\u2026It\u2019s the center of Chinese experimentation. There, officials can test what works and what doesn\u2019t: which corporate tax rates offer the best balance of attracting foreign investment while filling government coffers in Beijing, which labor standards make the most sense, which corporate-governance standards are most advantageous, which immigration procedures are optimal, which regulations stay or go.\nOutsourcing? See 2 above with the addendum that Dongmen continues to grow. One of the more recent examples was Foxcomm\u2019s decision to move its manufacturing base out of Shenzhen and turn the Bantian campus into a research and development center.\nLeaving aside Pesek\u2019s shaky grasp of fact, his larger point, that Japan needs strong government intervention to grow the economy is based on the idea that tall skyscrapers, industrial parks, corporate tax rates, and immigration laws that work for industry are signs of economic success. Has he completely missed the fact of growing inequality throughout China more generally, but Shenzhen in particular?\nThe question of growing inequality is particularly relevant because preferential policies have predicated Shenzhen\u2019s competitive advantage. The most famous of the quotations in this regard was Deng Xiaoping\u2019s decision to \u201callow a few to get rich first\u201d. More to the point, in Shenzhen wages for manual labor remain more or less what they were over 15 years ago, while white collar salaries continue to rise. Meanwhile, the price of housing has gone up even faster than white collar salaries creating a situation in which most young people are trying to figure out if they will be able to purchase a home.\nThis entry was posted in noted, shenzhen elsewhere and tagged deng xiaoping, japan, neoliberalism, response, shenzhen, special economic zone, william pesek.

Yes, there are industrial processing zones and industrial parks and tax free zones all over the world. In fact, China learned from Singapore and Malaysia and Taiwan before establishing Shenzhen and the other four SEZs. And that\u2019s part of my point: Today most of the world has heard of Shenzhen, but not the Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan SEZs; even in China, the rate of SEZ success (if we are judging by neoliberal economic indicators) is limited to Shenzhen, even though there are now special zones of various flavor all over the country.\nChongqing and Chengdu\u2019s contrasting styles to development\u2013with a mention to income inequality.\nCurious as to your thoughts on the Chengdu v.

Bound in contemporary limp vellum, manuscript title on spine, remnants of ties, red sprinkled edges. Minor soiling and edge wear to binding, front pastedown torn and unglued, book labels of the historian J. B. Bury (861-1927) and Michael Bury (on the front flyleaf) and of the 19th-century English bookseller Samuel Maynard (inside upper cover). Minor spotting and wrinkling to title, mended marginal tear to p.l. 4, the occasional contemporary annotation, minor toning to a few leaves, the occasional minor stain, small marginal burn hole at f. II.42, minor wrinkling and small marginal tear in first quire of Book II, final leaf backed and with moderate toning.\nVery rare, with only one recorded copy in America (Harvard), the first complete edition (see below) of the sculptor and goldsmith Juan de Arfe y Villafa\u00f1e\u2019s (1535-1600) highly influential treatise on the practice of art and architectural theory extensively illustrated with more than 300 woodcuts. This work is important for being \u201cthe first printed and illustrated treatise on artistic anatomy\u201d (Skaarup, 254) and the second published original architectural treatise composed in Spanish, following only Diego de Sagredo\u2019s famed Medidas del Romano (1526). Remarkably (and rather mysteriously), some two dozen of Arfe\u2019s anatomical woodcuts in this work are derived from drawings by Leonardo da Vinci (via intermediary copies), providing a fascinating example of how Leonardo\u2019s graphic work circulated in the wider European art world centuries before his drawings were published (Skarrup, 353-4; R\u00f6hrl, pp. 40-96, 142-45). The De Varia Commensuracion para la Esculptura, y Architectura (1585-7) \u2013 which covers in its four books geometry, human anatomy, the proportions of quadrupeds & birds, as well as classical architecture & contemporary Spanish metalwork \u2013 was the \u201cmost frequently republished\u201d and consulted treatise on artistic practice and theory in Spain up to the turn of the 19th century (see Bonet Correa, p. 145), appearing in ten editions, the early ones being very rare. Its continuing influence has been recognized by its widespread inclusion in libraries of early Hispanic artists on both sides of the Atlantic, characterized by a \u201cmasiva presencia de Vitrubios, Vignolas, Serlios y Arfes\u201d (Soler I Fabregat, p. 149 and passim). The painters Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and Alonso Cano are but a few known to have owned a copy of Arfe (Fajardo, 88-90).\n\u201cThe success of the Varia in Spain and in Latin America was extraordinary, being a compendium in a single volume of distinct fields of artistic and scientific knowledge, the borders of which were not at the time established with the same categorical precision as they are today\u201d (Bonet Correa, 157). Books Two and Four are the two most historically influential parts of the Varia. Book Two, on human anatomy, is divided into four subchapters on proportion, osteology, myology and foreshortening of the human figure. Arfe claims here a number of influences, including D\u00fcrer\u2019s treatise on proportion (1528) and Juan Valverde de Amusco\u2019s interpretations of Vesalius\u2019 Fabrica, but he also mentions the artists Pollaiuolo, Baccio Bandinelli, Raphael, Donatello, Mantegna, Michelangelo and the Spaniards Pedro Berruguete and Gaspar Bezerra (ff. 1v-2v). Arfe comes to the practice of artistic anatomy having spent time as a student training in the dissection theater under the direction of the famed physician Cosme de Medina (d. 1591) at the University of Salamanca (f. 25v), leading scholars to remark that \u201cNowhere in an Iberian context was the close, even dependent, relationship between anatomists and artists more evident than in Juan de Arfe y Villafa\u00f1e\u2019s Varia \u2026 the Libro segundo is a rare and unique source produced by an anatomically trained artist of the late Spanish Renaissance\u201d (Skaarup, 246). According to Choulant, the Varia \u201cshould\u2026 be considered the earliest of the numerous works which dealt with anatomy for graphic and plastic artists\u2026\u201d (Choulant, p. 32).\nBook Three of the Varia, on the proportions of animals, draws heavily from Conrad Gessner\u2019s four-volume Historiae Animalium (1551-8) and includes, along with depictions of more common birds and quadrupeds, the images of an elephant, camels, ostrich, and D\u00fcrer\u2019s famed rhinoceros. Arfe\u2019s horse recalls the equestrian statues of the Italian Renaissance and serves as a reminder that establishing the precise proportions of the horse was also a preoccupation of such artists as Leonardo (in the Codex Huygens) and Sebald Beham (Proporcion der Ross, 1528).\nIn Book 4, Arfe writes of the Roman ruins in Spain, the architecture of Bramante, Baldassare Peruzzi, and Alberti, as well as modern Spanish architects and those goldsmiths whose work (on liturgical vessels) can be characterized as \u2018micro-architecture,\u2019 beginning with the metalwork of his grandfather. Arfe illustrates the classical Orders based on Serlio, adding a sixth \u2018Attic\u2019 order, and treats various aspects of architectural ornament. At the time of its publication, the Varia was only the second original architectural treatise composed in Spanish \u2013 following Diego de Sagredo\u2019s famed Medidas del Romano (1526) and derivative works of translation such as Villalpando\u2019s Tercero y Quarto libro de Serlio (1552), Zamorano\u2019s Diez Libros de Architectura of Alberti (1582), Miguel de Urrea\u2019s Vitruvio (1582) (Fajardo, 130; Bonet Correa, 158). \u201cArfe\u2019s treatise, with its more timeless character, transcended its own era\u201d (Bonet Correa, 158). Although the Medidas del Romano of Diego Sagredo appeared in three Spanish editions and further French and Portuguese translations, its emphasis on the \u2018Plateresque\u2019 style of architecture contributed to the waning of its popularity during the 17th century, even as the popularity of Arfe\u2019s treatise increased.\nArfe extends Book 4 with a highly original discussion of metalwork, in which he aligns his own specialty with the more theoretically sophisticated field of pure architecture. His woodcuts of liturgical items (monstrance, chalice, aquamanile, crosier, crosses, candelabra, censer, etc.) are given a rigorous proportional treatment, with more sophisticated \u2018micro-architecture\u2019 custodias being shown in plan as well as in elevation, in the manner of full-scale buildings. Some of these illustrations depict surviving works by Arfe, while others are taken to be designs for lost or still unidentified pieces. It should be noted that while Arfe \u2013 despite the popularity of his treatise \u2013 perhaps was unable in his time to elevate his craft as a theoretically complex art alongside painting, sculpture and architecture, in recent times, art-historical research has vindicated his contention that metalwork of the highest quality should be prized not only for its pure material value and symbolic-liturgical importance, but also for its participation in the wider debates about the nature of representation, the supremacy of panting vs. sculpture vs. architecture, etc.\nBooks One, Two and Four of the Varia are dated 1585 on their colophons, while Book 3 is dated 1587. The first two books are occasionally found bound without Books 3 and 4, and it is surmised that the final two books appeared in 1587 (in spite of the 1585 date on Book 4), after an interruption in printing caused by a fire or a controversy about privileges, at which point the complete work was bound together as seen in the present copy (Fajardo, 72-2; Bonet Correa, 159).\nJuan de Arfe was the third in a line of renowned metalworkers originally hailing from Germany \u2013 following his grandfather, Enrique, and father, Antonio \u2013 and is known to have been active in Valladolid, Sevilla, and Madrid. His custodias (monstrances) at the Cathedral of Sevilla and Avila remain celebrated works of Renaissance goldsmithing in the classical mode, showing the influence of Donatello and Bramante, among others. \u201cArfe\u2019s last sculptural works of life-size human figures, such as the exquisite tomb monument for the Archbishop of Seville, Don Crist\u00f3bal de Rojas, reveal his development as a leading naturalist of the late Spanish Renaissance\u201d (Skaarup, 253; see principally Sanz, and Fajardo for Arfe\u2019s artistic activity). In addition to the Varia, Arfe published Quilatador de plata, oro y piedras (1572) and Descripci\u00f3n de la tra\u00e7a y ornato de la custodia de plata de la Sancta Yglesia de Sevilla (1587), both short tracts on metalwork.\nThe present copy, intriguingly, carries the apparent signature of Arphe himself on the bottom margin of the title page. This exact signature is also present in the same location in copies now at the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a and the Biblioteca de Castilla y L\u00e9on (effaced), a detail which might shed further light on the early publication history of the Varia.\n* Palau 16055; Adams A2003; CCBE s.

{"text": "If you enjoy hiking and spending days out in nature, then Washington is one of the best places on the planet to be. Also known as the \u201cEvergreen State,\u201d there are state parks, national parks, national forests, and wilderness areas in each and every corner of Washington that just beg to be explored. While some of your hikes here might be a bit rainy, Washington also gets lots of sunshine each year to help you get out among the trees. These are a few of our favorite Washington hikes to check out next time you\u2019re in the Pacific Northwest!\nThe North Cascades is a wonderful place to take a hike, especially between the months of July and October. One great hike here is Horseshoe Basin on the East Slope. The trail here is about 12 miles long and gains approximately 1,550 feet of elevation. This is a favorite hike among backpacking enthusiasts because you can extend this hike to be even longer and spend several days or even a week exploring the region.\nMount Baker is known as the go-to ski destination for Seattle residents during the winter, but the forest in this region is perfect for hiking in the summer and fall too. For example, the Chain Lakes hike at Mount Baker can be between two and eight miles, depending on how long of a hiking day you\u2019re looking for. The route gains about 1,700 feet in elevation and can be completed as an easy loop or a longer backpacking trip. Just be aware that there are several off-shoots of the trail, so bring a map so that you don\u2019t get lost. The snow here often extends throughout the spring and early summer months, so delay your trip until August if you want to avoid the white stuff. Plan to spend about four or five hours on this loop hike.\nMount Rainier is one of the most popular hiking destinations in Washington, and a famous hiking route here is Burroughs Mountain. This trail is about 4.7 miles long, has 900 feet of elevation gain, and takes about 2.5 hours to complete. You can find the trailhead from the Sunrise parking area, pass by Shadow Lake, and climb to the White River and Emmons Glacier overlook. Sunrise Camp is about a mile from the parking area if you want to obtain a camping permit and stay overnight. This is one of the most accessible tundra regions of the Cascades with superb mountain views with every step you take.\nAnother great Mount Rainier hike is Tolmie Peak, which travels to a lookout point and along Eunice Lake. One trail option travels about 7.5 miles long and reaches a high point of 5,900 feet. This is another hike that\u2019s best pursued in August, September, or October. You\u2019ll get awesome views of the mountains, lake, and trees for all your hard work getting up the mountain on this Washington hike. This is a family-friendly hike that you can bring the kids along for. You\u2019ll need a national park pass or to pay the daily fee to enter the park, and plan to spend about three hours on this hike.\nSnowy Views on the Snow Lake Trail, Snoqualmie Pass, Cascade Mountains, Washington.\nA wonderful moderate-difficulty hike in Washington is the popular Snow Lake Trail, which starts from the Alpental ski area and has lovely views and campsites along the way. The trail is about 6.5 miles long and takes approximately three to four hours to complete for most hikers. You may see wildflowers along the steep and rocky trekking route here, but save your adventure for summer or fall to avoid the potential of avalanches.\nMount St. Helens is a Southern Washington volcano that erupted in 1980 but has been deemed safe to hike again today. You\u2019ll need to get a permit to hike to the summit of Mount St. Helens, which is about five miles each way, and be prepared to hike through some volcanic ash. The top of the mountain stands at 8,365 feet tall and offers amazing views of the South Cascade mountains. Monitor Ridge is a highly recommended hiking route here that is hard but doesn\u2019t require any technical climbing skills. Permits are required year-around, and only a limited number of permits are given out per day between April and October. Gloves are recommended for the ash pumice areas that are harsh on skin, a jacket is also recommended because it is often quite windy on the peak, and trekking poles make this hike a bit easier on the knees.\nAnother unforgettable national park worth visiting in Washington is Olympic National Park, which is home to the strenuous Mount Ellinor hiking trail. Only attempt this trail if you\u2019re an experience hiker because of the serious elevation gains involved. The hike lasts about three to four hours for most hikers and is about 5.5 miles long. Along the way, you\u2019ll experience lush forests, snowy mountain peaks, and awesome views. This is a hike that is best done between the months of March and November.\nThe Pacific Crest Trail, or PCT, extends from Mexico to Canada, and some great portions of it extend through the state of Washington. In total, the PCT extends 2,650 miles long, but you don\u2019t need to have that kind of endurance to experience this epic hiking route for yourself. One popular portion of the PCT that you can hike is from Stevens Pass to Snoqualmie Pass. This is a 75-mile portion of the PCT that passes through some very scenic parts of the Cascades. If you have even more time and energy than this, you can hike a 147-mile portion of the PCT in Southern Washington from Bridge of the Gods on the border of Oregon and Washington to White Pass. Just be prepared for some serious elevation gains and lots of climbing and descending to go with your epic views of Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, and the Columbia River.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T08:31:20Z", "url": "https://www.tripstodiscover.com/most-beautiful-hikes-in-washington-state/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Where is the mail stored in the filesystem?\nI have zentyal 3 with zarafa configured as the mail gateway.\nWhere in the file system is the user mail stored? I would like to know for backup purposes etc.\nIe if I was restoring the server from an image what would I need to restore from the backup to recover the mail.\nRe: Where is the mail stored in the filesystem?\nFound using forum search feature.\nChristian is correct. It is stored in a mysql database. Xtrabackup (Percona.com) for live incremental backups or mysqldump to backup just the email. By default mysql is setup for one big file instead of table per file.\nUse the ssh connection method with your regular user name.\npassword is stored in /var/lib/zentyal/conf/sa-mysql.passwd.\nThis gets you initial connection as sa. You can then add a user with needed privileges to do what it is you want to do. I do not recommend using the sa regularly. I assume that you are going to the mysql-dump route?\nHmm. . . this gets asked often enough that maybe it should be a sticky or in the tips and tricks section. Add on that eventually the email system will get sluggish and prone to crashing because of the \"all tables in one file\" decision and I think that a decent write up is in order. Sort of follows along with my next free time (chuckle) project which is to play with clustering Zentyal. I haven't forgotten that, christian. Just incredibly busy.\n*hint hint* volunteers please step forward..\nFirstly thanks for everybodies help on this.\nI'm running zentyal 3.0 (core 3.0.17) so what I'm about to say may not be relevant to earlier versions.\nthere are a few corrections to what folks have said on here.\nThe mail isn't actually stored in the MySql zarafa db. I loaded around 8000 mail items into the zarafa and it didn't significatnly affect the size of the database.\nThe mail and also the zarafa-search indexes (if enabled) are actually stored in the file systm under /var/lib/zarafa.\nThe configuration files would give the impression that this is just attachments but it appears to be all emails as well. Each email and attachement is stored in a nested, numbered folder structure as a gziped file.\nI wanted all my data stored on a NAS rather then on the server itself. This was quite easy to achive for the mail. It was simply a matter of copying /var/lib/zarafa to a new location and then creating a symlink from the /var/lib folder to the new location.\nRe: [SOLVED] Where is the mail stored in the filesystem?\nI am taking a closer look at users and privileges concerning mysql in the latest version. The file structure that you describe is really just the index.\ncopy the directory somewhere for safe keeping.\nOne not of caution -- I don't store attachments outside the database so I can't verify where they are.\nDid you setup file per table? If not they are stored in /var/lib/mysql/ibdata1. You will find that ibdata1 is rather large.\nBTW mysql doen't play nice over nfs. If you want real-time redundancy, you will have to setup replication (now you are getting into HA and load balancing).\nI was wondering about backing this file up. I run automysqlbackup which backs up all the databases. Will this be included somewhere? In the zarafa db backup? I wonder because it's sat outside the zarafa folder?\nIf you configured it to backup all databases then yes it will do the work. There are pluses and minuses to using mysql-dump. While every mysql install will have the tool, it still demands server downtime while backing up. Incremental, no downtime backups can be had with xtrabackup.\nThe design decision (not bug) in mysql s innodb engine causes it to become unstable over time in my experience. The database doesn't shrink as you remove data. Instead the file stays the same size and just the row information is removed. It tends to make things too big for the memory and storage footprint after some time. It also fragments the data causing queries to run slower. Normal optimization tools don't work on innodb in the single file configuration. Some will find this as an issue and some will never know. I know because I support 100+ email accounts on my system and it is very active.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T22:11:53Z", "url": "https://forum.zentyal.org/index.php/topic,14361.0.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "You see them every day, but chances are you only notice them when they\u2019re dirty. We\u2019re talking about your baseboards. They\u2019re on nearly every wall, in every room of your home. So, you\u2019ve probably wondered how to clean white baseboards, or really any color baseboards, at least once in your life. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve addressed for you in this guide. In it we show you the easiest way to clean baseboards by breaking down the cleaning steps into varying levels of difficulty and commitment. So, whether you\u2019re actually looking for the easiest way to clean baseboards or are searching for something a little more involved, we have you covered.\nNo matter what path you choose, you need a plan of action for how to clean your baseboards. Because they\u2019re in every room, you might go crazy if you try to clean every single baseboard in your home in one session. We suggest starting simply and tackling them one room at a time. And once you\u2019re done actually cleaning the baseboards, you\u2019ll realize what a big difference cleaning that little area can make.\nFirst things first, make sure cleaning the baseboards is last on your cleaning list. We suggest doing this because cleaning agitates dirt and debris in your home, and eventually it will accumulate along the baseboards of your home. This means if you start with them, you\u2019ll end up cleaning twice. Or even worse, you may end up with baseboards that are dirtier than when you started cleaning. Once all the other cleaning is done, grab your vacuum and its attachments. Use the crevice tool on your vacuum to clean along baseboards and into the corners where all that pet hair and dirt loves to gather. If you find that a few passes of your vacuum's crevice tool is not enough, this is where the power of steam can really shine to tackle those down low messes.\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with our PowerFresh\u00ae Slim Steam Mop, prepare to be amazed. This machine lets you take the natural cleaning power of steam on and above your floors in multiple ways. When it comes to cleaning baseboards, there are two specific ways you can use this machine to your benefit. First, if you detach the foot, it becomes an extended reach surface cleaner, meaning you can steam clean baseboards without having to get on your hands and knees. The steam mop also converts into a portable handheld steam cleaner with an on-hand tool kit, allowing you to carry tools and switch them out as you clean. Plus, if you\u2019re worried about how to clean wood baseboards safely, our steam machines are safe on sealed wood. However, we still recommend you test your steamer in an inconspicuous spot along your baseboards to make sure the steam doesn\u2019t damage them.\nDid you know you should also clean near the very bottom of baseboards where they meet your carpets? Our DeepClean DeluxeTM Pet is engineered with EdgeSweep\u00ae Bristles that do exactly what their name claims \u2013 they sweep debris along the edges of rooms while you\u2019re cleaning your carpets. Then, just be sure to follow the steps below, so they can really shine.\nAre you looking for a last-minute solution for the best way to clean baseboards with things you already have in your home? We can help with that too. For this method, all you need is a bucket, water, some dish soap, and a sponge. Mix warm water and the soap together in a bucket and wash the baseboards by hand. This gives you the opportunity to get up close and personal to any dirt that may be on your baseboards and give any areas that are particularly dirty a good scrub. After you\u2019ve cleaned them with soap and water, feel free to dry the baseboards with a towel.\nWhile you\u2019re washing your baseboards by hand, you may notice the corners are particularly dirty. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re probably the only person that\u2019s seen the dirt that up close. And what\u2019s better, cleaning the corners is pretty easy. We recommend using a cotton swab as a baseboard cleaning tool to wipe out that hard-to-reach dirt. If you\u2019re using the PowerFresh Slim Steam Mop, you may also consider using the bristle scrub brush attachment to steam clean those baseboard corners.\nThe finishing touch on cleaning baseboards is almost as quick as a trip to your laundry room. This is one of our favorite tricks. In fact, it may be the best baseboard cleaner tip out there. We\u2019re happy we get to share it with you! Grab a dryer sheet and take it into the room where you\u2019re cleaning baseboards. Rub the dryer sheet all along the baseboards. This simple task actually helps repel pet hair and dust from baseboards, so they stay cleaner, longer. And that means you won\u2019t have to clean your baseboards as often.\nWe hope these tips helped you find an easy answer to the popular question, how to clean baseboards, in a way that fits your busy schedule!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T10:49:36Z", "url": "https://www.bissell.com/blog/best-way-to-clean-baseboards", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "There's no better way to honor a bride-to-be than with a bridal shower, but where do you start? Here's your step-by-step guide to everything you need, from picking out the bridal shower invitations to making sure all of the guests have a blast.\nFirst, think themes! Whether you host a bartending tutorial or a trendy retro luncheon, we have plenty of bridal shower ideas to inspire you. Even the guys are getting in on the act with coed bridal showers. If that's your plan, here's how to plan a Jack and Jill bridal shower. When it comes to keeping everyone entertained, there's nothing like a few bridal shower games to create a festive mood. Another upside to planning a few bridal shower games is that they're a great way to get everyone to mingle and to introduce out-of-town family and friends in a low-key setting. And, last but definitely not least, make a plan for the food! Again, your bridal shower theme will be key in figuring out your menu. Is it a finger sandwich kind of event, or is a backyard BBQ more appropriate for your bridal shower theme? And if you want a little help with the cuisine, consider a potluck bridal shower to get everyone involved. Finally, it's time to send out bridal shower invitations!

{"text": "The change made by the DPC to NORMAM05/DPC Annex 4-A regarding the regulations for the transfer of personnel offshore is a significant step in moving towards creating an offshore environment that is safe for all workers to get to and from work.\nThe Brazilian Navy's Directorate of Ports and Coast (DPC) has recently altered the Maritime Authority Standards for the Approval of Material (NORMAN-05/DPC). The most important changes were alteration of item 0408 (Personnel Transfer Basket) and insertion of Addendum 4-A (Rules Governing Personnel Transfer Basket).\nAccording to the DPC, the purpose of the alterations is to help to safeguard human life in offshore operations and to fine tune the safety technical requirements for the manufacturing of personnel transfer baskets - a concern of the Public Prosecution Service for Labor issues, which wants to improve worker safety in transfers between vessels and platforms.\nNORMAN-05/DPC Addendum 4-A specifies that the structural features must be able to protect passengers from lateral, vertical and head impacts and must be made of stainless steel bars of tubes and enable buoyant material to be attached around it, so that an entire fully loaded basket assembly is able to float.\nIn order to meet the Brazilian legislation, Reflex Marine has launched the FROG-6, an operational tool that is able to provide a safe option for personnel transfers. The FROG-6 has been subjected to a variety of impact tests to verify its structural integrity and shock-absorbing capability and demonstrated its ability to self-align and float in water, something that is not possible with the traditional rope baskets.\nSandra Antonovic, the company's Chief Operating Officer (COO), says that, \"it is a safer method than the traditional rope basket, because it protects the passengers in the event of a lateral or vertical impact, fall or heavy landing. Furthermore, the buoyancy panels enable the device to float and self-align.\"\nAntonovic points out that the device is able to transfer injured people in safety, protecting them from falls, immersion and lateral and vertical impacts, confirming that, \"The FROG-6 is also a safe and versatile transfer device in Medevac (medical evacuation) mode.\"\nAccording to the executive, this change reinforces Brazil's position and desire to ensure an offshore environment that has minimal operational risks. Antonovic says that, \"By prioritising the safety of offshore workers, Brazil is placing itself alongside Norway, the UK and Canada - countries in the vanguard of ensuring that all workers return home safely.\"", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T02:34:19Z", "url": "https://news.reflexmarine.com/a-major-step-in-offshore-safety-brazil", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Often confused with the Stiff Leg Deadlift or Straight Leg Deadlift, the Romanian Deadlift (RDL) is a variation of the deadlift that is used mainly to strengthen hamstrings, back, and forearms (grip).\nHopefully, you regularly have deadlifts in your training program, if not, learn how to do so properly.\nDeadlifts are the king of leg exercises for a reason. They are a compound movement that hits almost every muscle in the body. Those looking to increase the amount of weight they lift off the ground should look to different variations of the movement to help strengthen weak points.\nWhen lifting heavy, there are two common areas of difficulty; grip strength and lat strength.\nAs you start to move towards the ground, the bar should stay close to the body, by using the lats. If the lats are not strong enough, the upper back can start to round, leading to rounding of the lower back(not good). The bar should travel in a straight line at all times to minimize the distance the bar moves.\nGrip strength is also necessary to control the bar on the way up and back down towards the ground. Lack of grip strength can cause compensations in your lower back, especially as the weight gets heavy.\nAlong with doing work that isolates the lats and grip, you should also do movements that mimic the deadlift but allow you to build strength on weak points. In a RDL, the bar starts at the top and you lower the bar but only until just below the knee. During the entire lift, you need to maintain proper control and since the bar never reaches the ground, it challenges your grip and lat strength in a great way.\nPosition the bar at about mid-thigh height.\nWalk up and place your hands on the bar just outside of your thigs.\nPosition your feet around hip width apart with your toes pointed forward.\nSqueeze your shoulder blades together and load your hips as you bring the bar down to just below your knees.\nYou should feel tension in the hamstrings and glutes at this point.\nRaise the bar back up to starting position.\nNote: The bar never travels to the floor, the reason is that you want to keep max tension on the hamstrings. Your back is also neutral for the entire lift.\nThis is great movement to add into your workoutsto help work on weak points in your deadlift. It can be done after your regular deadlifts or on a separate day.\nCheck out this great video from Brett Contreras on how to do an RDL (0:36-1:28).", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T05:57:23Z", "url": "http://fittag.com/news/deadlift-variation/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "A federal law that passed in 2008 was supposed to ensure that when patients had insurance benefits for mental health and addiction treatment, the coverage was on par with what they received for medical and surgical care. But until now, the government had only spelled out how the law applied to commercial plans. This week, federal officials released a long-awaited rule proposing how the parity law should also protect low-income Americans insured through the government\u2019s Medicaid managed care and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans. The proposed regulation is similar to one released in November 2013 for private insurers. \u201cWhether private insurance, Medicaid, or CHIP, all Americans deserve access to quality mental health services and substance use disorder services,\u201d said Vikki Wachino, acting director at the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services. Even if the state has carved out some benefits under a separate behavioral health plan, patients would be protected under the rule. Medicare patients are generally not affected by the regulation, nor are those in Medicaid fee-for-service plans. But the rule does affect the majority of the 70 million people on Medicaid who are in managed care plans, and the 8 million children covered by CHIP plans.\nDavid Wingate is an elder law attorney and practices in Frederick and Montgomery Counties, Maryland.

What started out small has now led to several yearly trips to countries around the world. Recently, our team was able to complete the 100th short-term medical and dental outreach in Zambia. Here are some of the lives you were able to impact in the span of just one day!\nOscar came to our medical tent reporting that he was randomly falling down every month. Just the night before, he had fallen down and sustained a traumatic injury to his right arm. The doctor said that it was the type of fracture that could have very easily severed his main artery in his arm. After Oscar\u2019s examination, it was determined that he had a seizure disorder. Unfortunately, he had no way of getting to the hospital for treatment, so we paid for his transport. By diagnosing his disorder, our team hoped he could avoid future injuries to his body.\nSweet Grace came to our outreach hunched over and suffering for aches that most 89-year-olds would experience. However, she did not have the simple medicines available to help. Our team was able to give her aspirin, blood pressure medicine and pills for her muscles; such simple solutions to the pain she was feeling. Our team was also happy to pray with Grace before she left; \u201cNow after prayer, I feel that my body has become normal. It doesn\u2019t feel as badly as before.\u201d She left standing much straighter!\n67-year-old Alex had been having trouble with his eyes for at least two years. He was not able to see clearly, and which caused him difficulty when reading. After meeting with one of our volunteers, he received a pair of glasses and was so ecstatic to be able to read again. What was the first book he picked up? One of Joyce\u2019s from the prayer tent!\nWe\u2019ve been able to treat 297,923 patients and see 106,056 salvations over the course of 100 trips, but there are so many more lives to reach!

{"text": "Have you ever been there? It also clarifies that you understand what they are saying. Even though the language we use to make small talk with new people may appear to be very simple, it is often difficult to use fluently without practice. . Wait until they are not obviously engaged with someone else. The basic premise is that you find common ground with the people with whom you communicate by using the right amount of self-disclosure, , and tact.\nIn each conversation, you'll learn more about a person as you toss out subjects and see how they respond. If getting drunker is your thing that's fine, but as you drink more it starts to socially disadvantage you as much as it helps. Keep an open mind, and if the conversation takes a turn to politics, keep it light and do not discuss heavy topics that are controversial. So work on your confidence. People love to be validated and have their ego fed.\nIt's so hard to sit and listen to the never ending story that she's just told me last week but to try to get out of it just means more drama. For example, if your friend wanted to be a writer, he might get up early on weekends and work on a book. Have a purpose for the connection, rather than approach hemming and hawing around. It doesn't have to be the greatest story ever told, just tell them about something you really enjoyed doing with your mate, like a boat ride or a cozy night by the fireplace when you sat there for hours discussing your top 10 favorite movies of all time. Listening will give you all the material you need to relate, ask relevant questions, and continue building the connection.\nThe answer is to become socially confident through real-world experience. Thanks Aaron Morton The Confidence Lounge I do this all the time! I like your example of a quick interaction question about coffee and then parting ways. They may even feel stupid and regret sharing their story. If the other guests won't think it's too rude, step aside and pretend to have a text conversation on your phone. Small talk is easier the more you do it, and it also isn't meant for long periods of time or to be shared with just one person. Why does this work and why am I telling you to fake it until you make it? Dog lovers bond over their pets.\nAfter all, you'll never see them again. People from other places, including countries other than your own, can give you new perspectives. They're fun and jokey and the topic will jump all over the place. The second issue, which this article will cover, is when someone wants to go to a party and socialize at it, but they're not sure how to do that. Use it as an and pay attention to little clues the person gives you, using those to ask more questions. This helps us to make the content on this website better for visitors.\nI've tried, but i just simply have no idea what's a great conversation starter. If you're shy about going out alone, bring a book or a journal at first, and take small steps to get comfortable with the feeling. And marginally surprised to see how psychology further insitagates a clear anti-social trend happening. Everyone wants to be around someone who brings and improves the atmosphere. Enjoying an ice cream sundae.\nRemember, the language is simple, but you must practice! Just say you're heading out, and don't feel you have to have a five minute going away conversation with each of them. And of course posture is a big deal. Some folks burn off stress by an afternoon at the gym. Did I come off as a creep? See the article for more information. If you assume everyone feels as you do, though, it's likely you'll get started on the wrong foot and end up with it in your mouth. You cannot handle a situation like that alone.\nBut at least we're likely to have some gorgeous spring flowers! But you can use the insights provided by Rogers to smooth over the rough patches in your chats with strangers. Once after like the 10th person, something happens, something boils and impulsates within you\u2026You feel free, amazing, powerful, attractive. How handy it would be if anyone else were ever around. Ultimately losing all hope in psychology, the bs classifications and complete methodology. Just a few minutes ago my buddy and I were sitting in a coffee bean and just to the right of us, outside the window, were two kids just dancing without giving a crap that anyone saw them.\nIt can be from a number of effects. He graduated from the American School of Professional Psychology in 2011. Call a family member you like talking to and catch up with them. This particularly comes up if it seems like everyone at the parties knows everyone else. What's appropriate to talk about really depends on the guests and the type of the party.\nMake sure you so that you sound friendly. Just know that deep down they are miserable people and you cannot fix them. Body language is definitely important: head up, shoulders back, and eyes focused directly on the person you intend to engage with. If there is immediate threat to the suicidal person's life or anyone else's, you must call 9-1-1 immediately.

{"text": "I've been intending to get out there and paint what I see as it gets warmer, but there just isn't much out there yet. Wet, brown grass, the old lavender stalks we never trimmed in fall, pine trees, and bittersweet. I don't care if it's pretty, I'm not painting bittersweet, because I'm convinced it wants to eat my yard and my house and me alive and I just don't like that.\nSo that doesn't leave much yet, but thank god it's Skunk Cabbage to the rescue! And what better plant to start off with than something that literally heats itself out of the snow?\nSkunk cabbage is one of the first plants you'll see in Spring here in New England, especially if you have any moist, boggy areas near you. You'll see the liverish-colored protective buds shooting up through the snow before most other plants, because it won't take no for an answer--it produces it's own heat (60 degrees!) and melts its way through that white crap. Who needs Spring when you can make it yourself? Eventually you'll see the yellow clump of complex flowers and then all the cabbagey leaves.\nOf course, it gets its name because it smells like skunk. Or decaying flesh. Or both.

{"text": "On 19th and 20th of September 2018, a mini-concert was scheduled to be held in front of the futsal field as part of the Autumn Club Festival. Unfortunately, it was raining cats and dogs over the two days, so the performances were canceled. The rain had been predicted several days before, but the Club Association of DKU did not prepare a contingency plan that would prevent its cancellation. The concert was merely delayed and eventually canceled due to incessant rain. This public performance takes a long time to prepare and is held only once a year. Everyone involved made an all-out effort for this mini-concert, but they did not expect a bad ending like this. The Autumn Club Festival is not the only event to have faced last minute challenges that potentially derail the best laid plans. We wanted to know more about these problems and how they were handled, so The Dankook Herald (DKH) conducted interviews with a few members from different campus clubs.\nIf you are a Dankookian (students of Dankook University), then you must know about the festival Danfesta, held every spring. During this period, there are often weather problems to overcome. Last year, with gloomy forecasts predicted, many Dankookians feared the festival would be canceled. While it wasn\u2019t totally canceled, a lot of events were abandoned or altered for the safety of the students due to the inclement weather.\n\u25b2 Lightings and speakers were covered to prevent the rains from flowing in.\nDuring the Autumn Club Festival, many clubs have their own booths to self-advertise. Some clubs even have performances prepared to promote themselves. However, this year, The Club Association had not prepared a backup plan in case of rain. So many clubs had to close their booths, missing a great opportunity to recruit new members and supporters. This was a problem because preventing the festival from closing in case of rain was one of the main promises made by The Club Association when they took over. In addition, in the Kakao-Talk chatroom with the club presidents, the subject of weather conditions came up many times, but nobody offered any specific solutions. They just said they would solve the problem if they had to. This lack of preparedness angered many students.\nAfter the Autumn Club Festival ended, the DKH heard many comments from two club presidents in the Department of Performing Arts. They were disappointed they could not make their long-waited performances. Both clubs had been preparing for the Autumn Club Festival for more than 1 month. They saw it as a great opportunity to showcase the kind arts they do. However, they were disappointed when the events were canceled. The performers had to wait all day before they were given the final decision to cancel the event by the Club Association. President of club b pointed out that this was not the first time the association cancelled performances because of rain. Club members had to cancel their busking performances during the last school festival due to rain. With the cancellation of two performances in a row, understandably the morale of members rapidly declined and the overall mood of the club was depressed.\nThey said, of course, it would be best if the Club Association scheduled performances on a day when it is not raining, but since they cannot control the weather, they need to develop a plan B. President A said that the Association could rent other venues, like indoor theaters in the Humanities Hall or the student theater in Hyedang Hall. Regardless of how many people attend the event, President A thinks the Association has a responsibility to provide the opportunity they promised, as the students prepared for it for numerous days. President B knows that all promoters of school events work hard for a successful result, but much more needs to be done. Students who do not belong to the school club don\u2019t even know when the festival is supposed to take place. B thinks more promotions are needed to improve attendance and also that they need people who are knowledgeable about electronic devices. A person who is in charge of using electrical devices is critical for the success of the performance, too.\nThe Dankook University Club Association was in charge of running the festival program. When the DKH asked whether they were aware of the forecast for the time of the outdoor performances they said, the plan was made and planned carefully a few weeks before the event. They realized that it could rain during the planning process and that the mid-term forecast at the time was not accurate for the event date, location, rental date, and promotional announcement date with various companies, so they went ahead with the plan.\n\u25b2 This is a picture of many people under umbrellas in the heavy rain at a festival.\nWhen asked if there was a plan B, in case it rained, the association answered, they were thinking of the student theater as the next best thing. They remember it rained on the last day of the festival in 1st semester and the groups preparing for the performance changed the venue to the indoor student theater for safety reasons. But most club members complained about the static atmosphere and the absence of classmates due to the layout of the student theater. As a result, they decided to stick to the outdoor plan, unless it rained too much.\nLastly, when the DKH asked about what measures are taken to address prevailing weather conditions for upcoming events, the association said, when planning events, Dankookians can plan for weather conditions during the rainy season, but they also have many other things to consider. For the event, you need to prepare several contracts and begin planning a few months before and it is impossible to make double contracts to cover unexpected weather situations. So associations need to change the venue and choose a direction that works regardless of the conditions. Unfortunately, the gym and the student theater are places where it is harder to move around as compared to the outdoors, so changing places is not the best solution either. If you can be certain that it will rain, then you can start planning the event in that place from the ground up, but it is obviously unrealistic to know for certain what the weather will be that many months in advance.\n\u25b2 Singer PSY performing at DANFESTA 2018 and students wearing rain coats due to the rain.\nThrough the interview, we learned that the organizers faced a lot of troubles when they were planning the event, how they solved problems, how they dealt with the school and how they understand and sympathize with their members. However, we also learned from club members that they feel the organizers were irresponsible for not being prepared for the rainy weather that was predicted. It is surely the role of the association to strive for the satisfaction of students, despite their organizational difficulties. As we stressed earlier, this has happened before, therefore many people were disappointed and students lost faith in the association. In order to better prepare for future events, the association needs to implement a thorough plan b and strive to restore the trust of the student body. Every association can see this as a lesson and be more vigilant and more aggressive in their actions when planning their events.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T10:13:11Z", "url": "http://dkherald.dankook.ac.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=11985", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "At the start of the year we began using their very in depth hands-on history project: HISTORY Through the Ages Project Passport World History Study: Ancient Greece (you can read my review here: A Study in Ancient Greece). It was great, but definitely very time consuming. With summer upon us, I was excited to do a fun, interactive but less intensive mini history course.\nWe received the Make-a-State Activity-Pak as a downloadable resource, but there is a CD version as well. It\u2019s intended for grades three through eight, but with a bit of help from me, my first grader was able to do the activities, too. The Activity-Pak contains instructions and printables for 20 projects that you can put together into one big Lap Book. The activities include key state facts, a state timeline, recipes, state geography and government, and much more.\nA nice thing about this resource is that you can use it for any state, so while we began with a study of our home state of Texas we can use it again later for other states, too. And of course we can pick and choose what all we want to use, so we can do just a few activities if we want to just touch on a state rather than learning ALL about it. And actually, because I\u2019m using this for first and fourth grade rather than third through eighth, I\u2019m not doing every activity in our Texas study, either.\nThe materials include a set of State Pages with some brief information to use for your key facts and such, but otherwise lets you choose where to pull information from to complete the activities. It also includes a bonus \u201cName That State!\u201d File Folder Game that can familiarize kids with the shape and location of states, capital cities, and more.\nSo, I thought at the beginning that we would go through and do 100% of every activity exactly as instructed and just have a blast learning about Texas this summer, but it turns out that I am just not very good at doing big projects, and this one was actually a lot more work than I realized it would be. In all honestly, I think I like the idea of hands on schoolwork more than the actual implementation of doing all the tasks. In some cases, the activities really just feel more like busy work than an engaging learning activity. For example, we chose to not bother at all with cutting out a recipe card and coloring and putting together a piece of the Lap Book for that, because it\u2019s not something my girls cared about at all. A better fit for our family is finding a recipe that Texas is known for and cooking and eating it.\nBut the state regions activity is nice and simple and educational, and the geography one is very adaptable so we can use in it whatever way best suits us.\nWell, that about wraps up my review, but be sure to hop over to the Homeschool Review Crew link-up to see what other reviewers have to say.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T14:19:28Z", "url": "http://runningwithspears.com/hands-on-history/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Each writer is entitled to their ain positions and how they allow them act upon their Hagiographas. O\u2019Connor used her religion and the manner she viewed Christianity to pervade her narratives and deliver messages she believed to be the most equal manner to maneuver others of the same or similar religion in the right way. Her upbringing, her environment, and the manner she lived her life had an exponential correlativity with her religion and the manner she tied it into the short narratives mentioned. You perilously word all the information above this bolded country in such a manner that suggests you knew O\u2019Connor. In the bolded country, though, you claim something you can non cognize without reading a beginning, which means you either accidentally plagiarized or you made a headlong claim. One is illegal, and the other is unethical. Besides, retrieve how we can non hold any beginning information in our thesis statement, subject sentences, or decision. Though some claim that her messages are difficult to understand, or may even be misunderstood, her beliefs are still in the Hagiographas themselves. Her characters frequently seem to be missing in religion, or oppugning their religion during the class of each narrative. The words and lines they speak in each piece of literature all have a spiritual significance behind them. Flannery O\u2019Connor expressed spiritual political orientation throughout her short narratives \u201c Good State Peoples \u201d and \u201c A Good Man is Difficult to Find. \u201d You need to state throughout her authorship. We can discourse why subsequently.\nNeed to bind all subject sentences to O\u2019Connor. In \u201c A Good Man is Difficult to Find, \u201d the character The Misfit expressed his uncertainty over the instructions of Jesus and God when discoursing with the grandma. He said things refering to the idea of losing his religion after he was incarcerated in the penitentiary ( O\u2019Connor, \u201c Good Man \u201d 375-377 ) . He claimed \u201c It was the same instance with Him as with me except He had n\u2019t committed any offense and they could turn out that I had committed onea\u02c6\u00a6 \u201d ( O\u2019Connor, \u201c Good Man \u201d 376 ) . He believed that no affair what he did, he would be punished. O\u2019Connor most likely believed that adult male will ever confront what he has done one time he comes before concluding judgement. The Misfit mentions Jesus and the manner he threw everything off balance by raising the dead. He claimed that if Jesus truly performed this action, so there was no other pick but to follow his words and instructions. The Misfit besides suggested that if what is said about Jesus were to be false, so there was nil else you could make but do the most of your life while you can. His word pick was much more colourful, imputing to his character and the manner he lived ( O\u2019Connor \u201c Good Man \u201d 375-377 ) . The Misfit \u2018s actions in the narrative besides coincide with the manner O\u2019Connor perceived God. She stated of God, \u201c a\u02c6\u00a6God is non accepted by work forces, so they have to be shocked into a acknowledgment of their demand for him \u201d ( Mayer 5 ) . The pick of words The Misfit uses during his discoursing with the grandma is to a great extent declarative to the writer \u2018s background. Such things are frequently suggested by those of the Roman Catholic religion, the religion that Flannery O\u2019Connor herself followed proudly and stated many times through interviews ( Liukkonen ) .\nTwo old ages after composing \u201c A Good adult male is Difficult to Find, \u201d O\u2019Connor wrote \u201c Good State Peoples, \u201d showing her positions over the difference in the symbol of the Satan and the darkness of life. When she was asked about the relation between the prankster character Manley Pointer, a immature adult male who posed as a bible salesman, and the Satan, she responded that his character was showing the \u201c psychological inclination \u201d ( Hawkes 397 ) I \u2018ve pointed out several times that MLA does non let for mentioning in the center of the text. See Purdue Owl. that we see as the darkness of life. When Pointer foremost appears in the narrative, he claims to be a low retainer of Christianity selling Bibles that did n\u2019t want to travel to college due to a bosom status. But as the narrative progresses he tricks Hulga and takes her unreal leg. He even claims that he had done such things several times before in other towns ( O\u2019Connor, \u201c State Peoples \u201d 390-391 Shorten the rubric and merely state \u201c Country \u201d and go forth the writer and page figure. See Purdue Owl. ) . The prankster character is frequently a pretense for the Satan in many narratives and fabrications throughout Christian instructions. Though one could reason Pointer was a literary incarnation of the Satan, Flannery dismissed this thought. Pointer was simply one who preyed on the faithful for his ain addition ( Hawkes 399 ) . Pointer stated that he had \u201c been believing in nil of all time since I was born \u201d ( O\u2019Connor, \u201c State Peoples \u201d 391 ) . This character embodies the position that those without religions are lost and merely looking for personal addition. Hulga \u2018s character in the narrative was an atheist, much to the discouragement of her female parent, Mrs. Hopewell. Mrs. Hopewell was n\u2019t portrayed as a devout Christian, but she did transport the beliefs and ethical motives of the religion. It even stated that her personal Bible was perchance in the Attic someplace ( O\u2019Connor, \u201c State Peoples \u201d 383 ) . The belief that seems to be common between the characters in the narrative \u201c Good State Peoples \u201d and O\u2019Connor herself is that if you are in fact good state people, so everything will be good and that their Godhead will judge them kindly when they leave this universe. O\u2019Connor used this message because she shared the same belief, coming from the people she lived about and was raised by ( Friedman 233 ) .\nA author \u2018s environment and upbringing are ever dominant factors in the manner they portray characters and state of affairss throughout their plants. O\u2019Connor was raised in the \u201c Bible Belt \u201d part of rural Georgia and was the lone kid of a strongly Roman Catholic household. Her male parent died of Lupus when she was at a really immature age. Over the class of her life, she acquired her instruction and began composing many southern based narratives and pieces such as the two narratives already discussed. After she was diagnosed with the same disease that killed her male parent, she stayed closed to her household place in Milledgeville, GA and continued authorship, integrating her spiritual beliefs into them with the manner Christians should lodge to their way. The at hand sense of the inevitable strengthened her religion during her ulterior old ages. Once she passed off in 1964 ( \u201c A Study of Flannery O\u2019Connor \u201d ) , her plants and peculiar authorship manner were left for everyone to analyse and review. But the contents of all of her Hagiographas still contain messages, ethical motives, and instructions of spiritual political orientation ( Abbott 3-8 ) .", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T10:27:00Z", "url": "https://essaylead.com/good-man-is-hard-to-find-english-literature-essay-794/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Finance Asia has a report on Asian tidal / ocean current power company Atlantis - Tidal power company moves to the next level.\nPower generation using tidal currents is the latest renewable energy source to emerge as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. The technology has yet to be deployed commercially, but the unparalleled predictability of the movement and intensity of tides suggests it has clear advantages for the power industry, versus some of the other renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power.\nAccording to an Atlantis press release, ocean power, which includes tidal current power, wave power and ocean thermal energy conversion, represents a vast source of energy estimated at between 2,000 and 4,000 terawatt hours per year. The US and the UK combined have sufficient ocean power potential to meet around 15% of their power needs.\nHaving spent 10 years developing its turbines, Cornelius says Atlantis is now ready to become the first tidal power developer to establish mini-arrays (essentially farms or fields of multiple subsea turbines of 1 or 2 megawatts each). This will allow it to aggregate the necessary data about environmental and turbine performance before it moves on to apply for permits for projects of a much more significant scale.\nThese commercial projects should see the company turn cash flow positive in 2011, he adds.\nThe company has had a 150KW turbine installed and connected to the grid in Australia since 2006 and is hoping to build up its generation capacity there, but it is also actively looking for several other sites both in Asia and Europe where it can set up trail arrays. It is currently evaluating potential installation opportunities in the Pentland Firth off Northern Scotland, in the Bay of Fundy and in British Columbia off the east and west costs of North America and off the coast of South Korea.\nChina also has the potential to become a \u201chuge\u201d market, according to Cornelius, since the company\u2019s Nereus turbine that is suitable for shallow-water can be deployed not just in tidal oceans, but in rivers too \u2013 and that is a resource that China has a plenty of. Atlantis also has a second type of turbine, the Solon, which is a deep-water turbine that can be installed in some of the fastest flowing currents in the world.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T13:45:46Z", "url": "http://peakenergy.blogspot.com/2008/09/power-of-atlantis.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "This was Reinsdorf's reply on Friday when asked whether the preseason announcement that Phil Jackson will not return as coach of the Bulls next season is, as the French saying goes, a fact accomplished.\nAnd the notation on the desk of Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago Bulls, also indicates his position regarding Michael Jordan's often-stated contention that he will play for no other coach than Jackson, and he will play for no other team than the Bulls, which would mean no Jordan filling up the nets next season.\nThe Bulls make their final regular-season appearance at Madison Square Garden this afternoon against the Knicks, and it seems inconceivable that Jordan will not return for yet another year, and that neither Jackson nor Scottie Pippen will be with the Bulls, either.\nJordan, still the world's greatest hoopster, is leading the National Basketball Association in scoring for the 10th time in his 14 seasons. Even at age 35, he is playing as good an all-round game as ever. Fans, players and team executives know this, so it can hardly be lost on Jordan himself.\nIt is also obvious that His Airness -- a little less airy these days and a little more earthy but ever sovereign -- is having a grand time at his occupation, and satisfying that remarkable lust for competition and success that has made him an indomitable basketball player.\nJordan has changed his mind before, remember. He quit basketball to play baseball and quit baseball to play basketball.\nBut hadn't decisions already been made? As recently as early February, Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, reiterated that Jackson would not return next season, after having led the Bulls to five championships and, if the best-laid plans of Krause and his men do not go awry, to a sixth come June.\nThe personality, or perhaps ego, clash between Jackson and Krause is no secret. While he hired Jackson, Krause also believes that after a certain time, a general manager and a coach may tire of each other, as, has been said, Jerry West and Pat Riley did with the Lakers, thereby compelling a change.\nIn fact, personality clashes between Krause and some of his players, including Pippen and Jordan, and assistant coaches over the years have been no secret. It seems, however, that Krause has had no such conflict with the owner of the team. But it also seems clear that Reinsdorf has sought for Krause and staff to zipper their lips in regard to what may transpire at season's end.\nStill, Reinsdorf's respect for Krause as a basketball operative is lofty, and for good reason. Krause became general manager in 1985, the year after Jordan was drafted. Six seasons later, the Bulls won the first of their championships.\n''Everyone on the first championship team except Jordan was acquired by Krause,'' Reinsdorf said. That included Pippen, astutely attained in a trade for his draft rights and now seemingly headed elsewhere next season as a free agent, although who knows for sure.\nPippen, who will be 33 in September, doesn't talk to Krause, but he does talk to Reinsdorf. And while Pippen is said to be seeking a huge five-year contract, Reinsdorf said he had yet to hear anything like that from Pippen, who has been bitter about what the Bulls have been paying him but has also been making plenty of money with endorsements.\nKrause took a chance on Dennis Rodman. He found a place for Steve Kerr. He traded a nonentity, Stacey King, for center Luc Longley. He traveled for years to Europe to court Toni Kukoc, and finally snared him. He saw the possibilities in Ron Harper's career being revived.\nYes, Krause has had Jordan all this time, but Jordan found that he couldn't do it alone. He didn't win his first championship until his seventh season in the league -- with a requisite ''supporting cast,'' as Jordan termed it.\nKrause has surely made mistakes, too, such as some draft picks.\nKrause, meanwhile, sometimes says things without a veneer of suavity. He can rankle in his bluntness, or, sometimes, in his evasiveness. And possibly he is frustrated in not receiving much of the due he believes he deserves.\nWhen he received his championship ring for last season along with the rest of the team at the season opener at the United Center, the boos for him were evident. It was odd, since if he had been the general manager of five championships in, say, New York, he could be Mayor of this town -- and on a write-in ballot.\nSo at what point do you make a decision to break up the team?\nLooking at their history, it is manifest that as a twosome neither Krause nor Reinsdorf is so stupid or driven by ego that he will perpetrate the sublimely imbecilic.\nThe view here is that Jordan will definitely be playing next season with the Bulls, with or without Jackson. But the odds of Jackson returning appear healthy, as well, especially if the Bulls win another title.\nIf there is one exception to ''Nothing is written in stone,'' it is this: It's a bottom-line game.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T13:28:45Z", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/08/sports/on-pro-basketball-one-last-hurrah-for-the-bulls-reinsdorf-isn-t-quite-saying.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "sailboat. : The sweetest home accessories!\nYou know when you see something that you don't really need but you do really want to have for reasons you can't quite fully explain? Well, that's exactly how I feel about pretty much everything from Qualy. Until a few weeks ago I had never heard of the brand, I had a Zalando voucher and just happened to stumble into the home section where I spotted the sweetest home accessories ever!\nSo, I didn't really need a pink bunny with scissors for ears, a carrot magnet and green paper clips for the carrot top but as soon as I saw it, crazy bunny lady over here was instantly adding it to my basket and hitting checkout! I'm really impressed with the quality, I did think the \u00a315 price tag was a little much but I've changed my mind because the scissors are actually really good, it doesn't feel or look cheap in any way and, well, it's undeniably cute! I love it so much!\nQualy Log & Squirrel Flower Pot!\nI'm not known for my green thumb, in fact I'm notoriously rubbish at keeping plants alive but I'm going to try and be better now I have this super cute flower pot! I don't have a plant to put in it at the moment but I'm actually really excited to go and get one, any excuse for a trip to the garden centre I'll happily take! When there's water in the bottom the squirrel floats up, which is perfect for a plant killer like me because I'll always know when I need to add some more water. At \u00a325 this certainly isn't cheap, but again I'm really happy with the quality & everything comes apart so I think it'll be really easy to clean. To be honest it was the little squirrel that totally sold me on this, look at those sweet little eyes, too cute!\nDo you have a favourite home accessories brand?\nDo you have anything from Qualy?\nThe only thing that I found with the pot was that somehow the roots have gone down the string and completely intertwined with it so I won't be able to use the pot for another plant in the future :') Still absolutely adorable though!\nI really love the Qualy range, I've been fancying the bunnies for agfes, have you seen the paperclip ones as well?\nDUh, I meant the tape one.\nThe desk bunny is just sooo lovely!\nYou got the bunny! Jealous, it's totally on my list after you posted about it before. That plant pot is exactly what I need too! Horrible at watering plants and keeping them alive. We even just tried again recently with some herbs. Sad days when they die!\nSuper adorable. I love the pink bunny!\nThese are so cute! I love them both, the squirrel is such a fab idea, too.\nOh my goodness, I want them both! So freaking adorable.\nOh my goodness.

{"text": "It all started 3 months back when two of us, me and Saquib were chatting over our late night coffee destination about going somewhere far from Bangalore. And, this time the plan was to push our bikes to a 10 days plan and explore a state, if possible. Probable destinations that came to our mind were Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Argument started over coffee and we felt Rajasthan would be too far for us to ride from Bangalore and Maharashtra looks best during monsoon and hence we were left with Gujarat. This was something which each one of us wanted to do, especially visit the Rann of Kutch and I very well knew that this time we are going there for sure as the planning started in full swing. Although it was initially me and Saquib who kicked off with the planning and research, we decided to pull in some close pals of ours who might be interested for this long road trip. Sunil, Tapabrata, Ashish and Eshwari (who would be joining us from Gandhinagar) showed immense interest in our plan and we were more than happy with the group which formed now. We decided to start for the trip on 31st January, 2014 (Saturday) and come back to Bangalore by 11th February, 2014 (Wednesday).\nThe days crossed by and our excitement meter was becoming unstable day by day. We were meeting at times, just to check if everything was on track, ran through the route map again and again so that everyone knows the route very well. Unfortunately, Sunil could only be starting by the second half of Saturday and hence he targeted to join us directly at Gandhinagar.\nFew days before the ride started and we hit a major setback: Saquib had a situation in his office and his could not get the leaves approved. This came as a big blow to get us because he was the person who was the mastermind behind this mega plan and all of us wanted him to be part of our group.\nDay 1 started with me, Tapabrata and Ashish riding from Bangalore and our target was to halt at Pune. We decided to start around 4 am in the morning to avoid all the early morning traffic. Once you are on the road, you hardly get to know what time it is, and it always surprises you. This stretch being arrow straight road, you tend to fall asleep, especially when your tummy is full. With couple of breaks including breakfast, lunch, tea and most importantly, photo breaks, when we reached outskirts of Pune, around 8 pm in the evening and we started looking for lodges along the highway. After few searches, we ended up at a decent enough lodge with an adjoining restaurant where we decided to bunk for the night.\nTarget for Day 2 was to reach Gandhinagar as we had already booked a hotel and the group was supposed to rendezvous at the hotel. So, as planned, we got ready as soon as possible and got out on the highway by 4:45 am. It was chilly as usual and I was shivering with cold, but on the other hand, the roads were completely new for me as this was an unknown territory for me, so feeling cold was at the back of my mind and watching out on the road was always my priority. We crossed beautiful places like Lonavala, Khandala and with the rising sun at the back of a train of hills, the scenery looked beautiful which made us stop at multiple places for pictures. It was an eventful day, starting with 3 of us entering the Mumbai-Pune Expressway by mistake and ended up paying up fine to the cops, to having lip smacking vada pavs for breakfast to sudden increase in the traffic, especially of the tucks and trollers which kept on testing our patience all throughout the highway in Gujarat to getting stuck at the infamous Golden Bridge in Bharuch for 2 hours and last but not the least, falling prey on big potholes on SH 3 near Ahmedabad and losing my taillight. By the time we reached Gandhinagar, it was 10:30 pm and dead tired. Eshwari was waiting for us at the hotel and when enquired about whereabouts of Sunil, we came to know even he had issues with his bike near Mumbai and he could not proceed further as well. That was a moderate blow to our itinerary, but more importantly, we needed some rest.\nRise and Shine Day 3. We got the rest what we wanted, and I found a mechanic to fix my bike's taillight. So, after having breakfast from the hotel, we headed towards Sabarmati Ashram and Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad, after which we headed towards Radhanpur. The initial plan of visiting Patan was dropped because of the delay of Sunil's arrival and instead, we decided to approach our next destination, the Little Rann of Kutch. Blissful tarmac all throughout, this is what we expected and heard about Gujarat and everyone of us were happy to ride on them. The more we approached Radhanpur, we noticed a change in the landscapes. We were no more surrounded by lush green fields, rather now we were able to see barren lands welcoming us from time to time, a notable decrease in vegetation. We crossed Radhanpur and headed towards Santalpur where we decided to bunk for the night. Constant touch with Sunil made us aware of him approaching Radhanpur for the night, so he can catch up with us the next day.\nIt was ought to be an exciting day, Day 4 it was. With the help of google location, Sunil met up with us at the guest house we stayed overnight and after sumptuous gujarati breakfast, all 5 of us headed towards Little Rann of Kutch. We approached a village after taking diversion from the NH and the moment we entered the village, there was chaos and obvious interest about us, where we coming from and all those stuff. It was like the entire village has come to greet us. Some older folks asked us where do we intend to go to which I asked about the little rann, they guided us to the right direction. We were already off the tarmac and the path was full with sand and we slowly made our way to the rann. And within few metres, we entered the little rann of kutch. A vast, barren land, with no trees, no water, hot and you could see the horizon all around you. It was an amazing feeling the moment I stepped into the rann. People started parking the bikes and start photo shoot, while I took some time to let the feeling settle down and finally pulled out my camera. Spending a good 1 hour at the little rann of kutch, we headed our way back to the guest house, it was time to check out and head towards Great Rann of Kutch! When we crossed the village of Lodrani, the Sun was getting ready to start its plunge towards the horizon and I started doubting whether we would be able to make it to Dholavira on time. Less I knew that I would encounter something magical on the way that would make us drop the plan of going to Dholavira and would make our day special. We got the first view of white rann few kms after we crossed Lodrani. So beautiful, magical feeling it was with cold rays from Sun over the horizon that we were spellbound with it and ended up stopping. No words can express that feeling and I was already having goose bumps seeing the beauty of nature. It took me quite some time to settle down, and believe that I am here, finally. We were so \"awwed\" by this place that we decided to stay there till the sun set. Mesmerized by the beauty of nature, we slowly started off from the place. We decided to drop the plan of visiting Dholavira because it was already dark and instead we headed towards Samkhiyali where we bunked for the night.\nWe started our Day 5 riding to Bhuj, our base for the next 2 days. It took little time for us to look for a decent accommodation and once we got freshened up, we headed for Kalo Dungar after lunch. We already had the permits prepared on our way though, which was a simple procedure. Kalo Dungar is the highest peak in the entire Kutch region and you get a spectacular view of the white rann from the top. We parked our bikes at one side and started walking towards the view point. Strong wind was gushing on our faces all along. The moment I saw the view of the rann, i seemed to me at the first moment if I am actually dreaming, or is it real! Ashish walked up to me at that very moment and said: \"Can you believe we came this far?\". I could not answer, it was the same feeling even I was having and what I wanted at that point of time was to simply enjoy the view. We continued from Kalo Dungar towards India Bridge in some moment's time. Road has been excellent all throughout the leg of the day and not even a single pothole was to be seen anywhere. We approached India Bridge around 4 pm, took some shots except the bridge (Photography of the India Bridge is prohibited by law), where Sunil went over to the jawans for some chat and in few moments, we made our way back, this time towards the White Rann. We did not want to try Dhordo which was already populated due to Rann Utsav and instead headed towards Jamkundaliya, where there was a BSF check post at the entry of the rann. A Bengali and a Kannada jawan stopped us from entering this restricted area and after few conversations and request, they did let us in the rann. The moment we left the check post, the tarmac vanished and red soiled road started. After few meters even that disappeared and we ended up in a dusty and sandy road. We held our breaths and in no time, we entered the white rann! We could indeed see lot of slush on both sides of the truck-tracks and although, it de motivated us a bit, because we expected a plain surface, but after few meters, all the slush disappeared and we were surrounding by white rann. Anywhere you see, we would see only the horizon with some hills at a distance. This is what we wished for! Everyone started yelling with joy, and roared their bikes on the plain surface of rann! Eshwari, who was on the thunderbird, was so excited that she pushed the accelerator hard and kept the throttle going, and we sped past few Kms. Amazing experience I must say, maybe this is the same experience which people gather at the Salt flats, Bonneville! Eventually she came to a halt trembling with sheer excitement! It was the moment where you feel that you riding all the way to Gujarat from Bangalore is success, all the tiredness vanishes the moment you are here. This was one of my best days yet, less would I be able to forget about the experience. We returned back to Bhuj for the night.\nDay 6 started off as a gloomy day, with Eshwari returning back to Bangalore. We had our bikes serviced at Bhuj and headed towards our next set of destinations, the Lakhpat and Narayan Sarovar. When we approached Lakhpat we could see desert all around us, on both sides of the road and a fort, standing tall in the middle of it. A road made of sand went through the fort with lot of diversions and I took one of them and started going towards one of the walls of the fort. I could see few faces peeping from few houses, eager to ask me about my whereabouts, but I ignored them and continued. After exploring some other lanes in the fort, I headed back to the fort entrance, continuing towards Narayan Sarovar. I must say that the place looked superbly beautiful and I experienced one of the best sunsets of my life here. There was a temple right at the edge of the sea (Koteshwar temple) and it was being maintained by the army. There was a checkpost right at the end of the pier and civilians are normally not allowed to go beyond that point. So, we parked our bikes at the very spot from where we could see the sunset. After good 2 hours spent at that very place, it was time for us to finally leave towards Bhuj.\nDestinations to be covered for Day 7 was Mandvi, before we head towards the another crown of Gujarat, The Gir. Main attractions of the day were the Wind Farm beach, dotted with windmills along the beach and the ship building yard. Both places were worth visiting and it was a delight for us to be there, after which we headed towards Morbi to shelter for the night.\nDay 8 seemed excited as he headed towards Junagadh, the gateway to Gir. We were welcomed by family of our friend who had made arrangements for our stay for the night in Gir at The Wilds Villa resort. The resort did not have any fencing and when inquired, we came to know that the day before, two lions had come over to that very place. Take that! And we were excited. The setup was splendid though with bonfire setup around 3 \"charpai\" where we lied down the moment we completed our dinner.\nWe were all excited to start the Day 9 early with the Gir Safari. However, due to lot of crowd at the ticket counter, we could not manage tickets for the early morning 6:30am one, but got the tickets for the 9:00am safari. As the Gypsy cruised through the jungle trail, we sighted deers, peacocks, langurs and a solitary Asiatic lion. It was not what we expected, but the guide told us that it need sheer amount of luck to sight lions in Gir and most of the safaris go back without even sighting a lion, to which we felt better. We left Gir and headed towards Vadodara, and honestly speaking each none of us were excited anymore, we did not want to leave this exciting and vibrant state and 10 days in this state was simply not sufficient, we felt that we needed at least 10 more days to explore more.\nDay 10 and we headed towards Pune where we were supposed to take shelter for the night. It was a boring ride all through to Bangalore on Day 11 when we finally reached home, exhausted and with a feeling \"We did It\".", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T18:04:56Z", "url": "http://blog.wickedride.in/2015/03/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "\u201cDo you really think you\u2019re perfect?\u201d The preacher asked.\nSome people act like they\u2019re perfect. Or our faulty memory thinks our loved ones are or were perfect.\nI recently read a facebook post by a friend who was told by a fellow Christian that he rarely sinned. He opined that he was not a sinner, but a saint. Actually, as my friend observed we can be both sinners and saints at the same time. Saints can and do sin.\nAs Christians we are not perfect, but we are pardoned. We\u2019re not sinless, but we\u2019re sanctified. We\u2019re not faultless, but we\u2019re forgiven. We learn that our failures don\u2019t have to be final or fatal.\nI might be well to remember that some of God\u2019s greatest heroes failed. Some miserably.\nYet, they didn\u2019t quit. They didn\u2019t allow failure to define them, discourage them or defeat them. Their failures were forgiven. And they pressed on toward the prize. That\u2019s what we must do.\nWe must be willing to admit our failures. Confess our shortcomings. And repent of our sins. We are a work in progress. Ever striving to be conformed to Christ instead of our culture (Rom. 8:29; 12:1-2).\nThe late and legendary basketball coach John Wooden reminds us, \u201cFailure isn\u2019t fatal, but failure to change might be.\u201d Or as the great British statesman, Winston Churchill observed, \u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d The Christian life is about change. Growth. And persistence.\nLike the apostle Peter, we can begin again. We can put together the broken pieces. Refocus our eyes on Jesus. And even with our past flaws be restored to faithful service. Let us pray as David did: \u201cRestore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit\u201d (Ps 51:12).\nThere is hope. There is help. There is healing.\nThere is a forgiving and gracious God.\nKen, thanks for this. I\u2019m sure I needed it more than anyone else this morning\u2026.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T22:09:37Z", "url": "https://thepreachersword.com/2018/12/04/how-to-recover-from-failure/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

The complexities of healthcare access and financing were clearly shown in a moving life experience of a 13-year old Nigerian orphan named Praise Sunday during a church service on Sunday 12th February 2017 at The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations (SCOAN), Lagos, Nigeria.\nIn an armed robbery on May 8th 2016, Praise Sunday tragically lost his mother and sister. During this ordeal, the young boy, whose father passed away several years earlier, sustained life-threatening injuries to his throat.\nPraise and his extended family members sought medical assistance across Nigeria, depleting their financial means as he underwent seven surgeries. Left with a tracheostomy tube in his throat which enabled him to breathe, he was completely unable to talk and communicated only through writing. In September 2016, they sought aid at The SCOAN, a religious institution known for its extensive charitable endeavours. The General Overseer, T.B. Joshua, through the humanitarian arm of his faith-based organization, financed a delicate and complex health procedure carried out in Life Vincent Pallotti Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa.\nSpecialists, Dr Martin Vanlierde and Professor Mark De Groot, undertook the corrective surgery to restore Praise's ability to both breathe and speak normally again. The procedure was successful and his speedy recovery exceeded expectations. The total cost of Praise's travelling expenses, welfare and medical bills was US$50,000 - all financed by T.B. Joshua's faith-based organisation.\nDuring a live broadcast of his story on Emmanuel TV, T.B. Joshua addressed the congregation, encouraging faith leaders and medical doctors to work together to address the societal conundrum, related to healthcare access today. He said: \"If God's servants and doctors work together, there will be no limit to what they can achieve. The medicine doctors use comes from nature and our God is the God of nature.\"\nThe SCOAN has previously financed other medical trips, including a Nigerian policeman who received more than $25,000 to be flown to India for a complicated medical procedure to restore his damaged urinary system after he was shot by gunmen during duty hours.\nWith their collaborative effort, faith-based organisations, such as The SCOAN, which helped turn a young boy's ordeal into an inspiring story, can largely enhance healthcare access and its financing.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T04:01:22Z", "url": "https://www.perssupport.nl/persbericht/117373/faith-and-healthcare-t-b-joshua-finances-a-young-boy-s-throat-surgery", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "What does it mean if my variable rate loan is tied to LIBOR?\nLIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is one benchmark, or index, to which the interest rate on an adjustable (variable) rate loan may be tied. (The \"prime rate\" is another frequently used benchmark.) Any adjustable rate loan or other financial product tied to a benchmark will follow that benchmark\u2019s movements up and down.\nFor example, if the margin (the percentage added to the benchmark rate) on your adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is 1.25% and the LIBOR is 2.5%, your interest rate would be 3.75% (1.25% + 2.50% = 3.75%). In this scenario, if the LIBOR increased a quarter percent, to 2.75%, your new rate would be 4.00% (1.25% + 2.75% = 4.00%). That could be a significant increase on a larger loan, resulting in many thousands of dollars extra interest paid over the life of the loan. Likewise, a lower LIBOR would save you money on interest payments.\nIf you have a fixed rate loan, the LIBOR does not affect you. If you have an adjustable rate loan, your loan documents, and possibly even your monthly loan statement, will tell you if your rate is tied to the LIBOR. If you can\u2019t find the information there, you can call your loan servicer and ask.\nIn the \"LIBOR scandal\" of mid-2012, accusations were made that LIBOR had been manipulated by the banks that determine the benchmark's rate, allegedly since the early '90s, to either make money or to make their bank and the banking system as a whole appear stronger. Because in that particular instance the interest rates had been manipulated downward, average borrowers with LIBOR mortgages, student loans and other forms of credit most likely benefited from the manipulation. However, some consumer and institutional investors may have experienced lower returns on their money.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T14:33:50Z", "url": "https://www.consumer-action.org/helpdesk/articles/libor_variable_rate_loan", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

I was not told that a position was being held for me, so I assumed that there was no job for me.

I was put forward as a candidate for our carrier-grade Wi-Fi unit.

My role will involve up to 50% of my time traveling to customer sites for testing, demos, proof of concepts, technical support and even some training.\nIn the interviews, and re-emphasized by the HR prime, everyone wanted to make sure I was ok with the travel demands. I spoke with Rosa and had an honest appraisal of my desires, and agreed that I would welcome the travel.\nWith that, I was offered the job and I accepted.\nToday is my first day. It is a different office building than the rest of the Ottawa teams. But I already know many people from Ericsson (and even one from Nortel).\nI have spent the day going through the training program again.

{"text": "(HOST) As the season for summer blockbuster movies about super heroes and rings of power approaches, commentator Willem Lange is feeling nostalgic for other mighty champions of yesteryear.\nearly western United States. Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a greater champion of justice. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. From out of the past come the thundering hoof beats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!\"\nHow many times I must have heard those lines, and how impressive they must have been, to be remembered 70 years later?\nmeans stupid in Spanish? What did kemo sabe mean? \u2013 boss, or pal, or champion of justice, or paleface idiot?\nWhen I was little, there was no radio in our house; our parents were deaf. Our grandparents had a big table-model Philco in their parlor. Just as kids nowadays tease for an iPhone, I kept asking for a radio until I got it. A tiny, dark-brown Bakelite-cased Arvin, it sat on the sideboard in our dining room.\nEvery weekday, from 4:45 till 6:00 in the afternoon, I pulled my long-legged chair up to the sideboard, turned on the radio, and gazed at the dial. Many of you must remember \"watching the radio\" and memorizing the numbers of the AM dial, from 520 to 1610 kilohertz. I could tell from the glances I got from my parents as I sat there \u2013 sitting still for longer than at any other time in my life \u2013 that they suspected I was listening to something inappropriate and possibly sinful.\nAt 4:45 a voice crackled over a simulated radio transmission: \"CX4 to control tower. CX4 to control tower. Standing by\u2026\" The answer was immediate: \"Control tower to CX4. Wind southeast, ceiling 1200. All clear.\"\n\"This is Hop Harrigan, coming in!\" So it went: five 15-minute episodes, featuring Jack Armstrong, Captain Midnight; Terry and the Pirates, and finally Tom Mix.\nEvenings, there were half-hour shows \u2013 The Green Hornet; The Shadow, in real life Lamont Cranston, \"wealthy young man-about-town\" who once in the Orient had learned to \"cloud men\u2019s minds so they cannot see him.\"\nEverything we imagined was the product of our separate minds\u2019 eyes. When the Lone Ranger walked across the board platform of a railroad station, each of us constructed a different scene. It was like the famous \"driveway moments\" on Public Radio; you could do nothing else demanding thought while you were into an on-air drama. Listening to archived recordings now reveals it to have been pretty simplistic drivel. Still, wasn\u2019t it glorious!\n(TAG) You can find more commentaries by Willem Lange at VPR-dot-net.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T20:03:59Z", "url": "https://vprarchive.vpr.net/commentary-series/lange-old-radio-days/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "So you want a college degree.\nIn the USA, about the only acceptable answer is \u201cChaaa, to get a bitchin\u2019 new Camaro, hombre!\u201d If you are a parent and already have a bitchin\u2019 Camaro, you want your children to go to college so they, too, can afford their own bitchin\u2019 Camaros. Education is just that important! More education, more Camaros.\nDo you think I\u2019m cynical? Do you think I consider my countrymen to be that crass and \u2014 heaven forfend \u2014 stupid?\nWell, yes I am. And yes, yes I do.\nI\u2019ve based my conclusions on a lifetime of observations of what Americans truly value. It isn\u2019t education, really. We don\u2019t care what kind of low-brow, thick-fingered troglodyte dullard you resemble as long as you have good credit and faithfully participate in consumerism. A college education has traditionally been the best path to full citizenship, where you extract the maximum compensation from a corporation in order to pay for dumb stuff that\u2019s supposed to make you happy and obviously better than others.\nSo really, I support free college for everyone. I\u2019d like college degrees to be so common that they no longer represent any potential income advantage at all. I\u2019d like to see the market flooded with not only liberal-arts majors, but also engineers, doctors, scientists \u2014 everything. At that point, we\u2019ll all be living with mom until we\u2019re 40 while working at Starbucks, and this whole spurious correlation of degree with income will be a distant memory. We\u2019ll get to study whatever we want, and to get back to actually valuing education over GM\u2019s answer to the Ford Mustang.\nYou with me on this? I hope so.\nAnyway, when politicians on stage talk about making college more available or even free, some people in their audiences get excited. The people who get excited are people who haven\u2019t yet gone to college, or parents of people who haven\u2019t yet gone. Then, there are those who get resentful. These are the people still making college loan payments.\nIn the minds of the people who get excited there floats one specific image. It\u2019s not an image of long nights spent inhaling the wisdom buried in books, nor hunched over a laptop writing the one research paper to end all research papers. It\u2019s not an image of long conversations on campus with other seekers, when all come to some new mutual understanding of a truth revealed. It\u2019s not an image of a lifetime spent as an enlightened citizen armed with the knowledge and cognitive tools to make good choices in one\u2019s community and to truly participate in democracy.\nNo. The image is of a yellow Camaro. With stripes. Just like Bumblebee from Transformers.\nSo perhaps it\u2019s only just that college not be free after all. It\u2019s not really about education, see. It\u2019s more like a business. Put in your 4-6 years and your $100K-$250K and if you\u2019ve played your cards right, you have income for life. But the only way this can work is if there is some entrance fee. Gotta keep it exclusive in some way. There aren\u2019t enough Camaros to go around.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T18:05:01Z", "url": "http://billlabrie.com/free-college-not-so-fast/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Just took a \u201cTrophy of a Lifetime\u201d What\u2019s Next?\nYou have just harvested a trophy of a lifetime maybe it will even make the Boone and Crocket or Pope and Young record books, now what? This experience may not be encountered again for many years for most hunters, so you need to be made aware of the questions a taxidermist will ask you and what you need to Mounted Whitetail Deerask them before contacting a taxidermist. You also know that you will have the animal mounted by a reputable taxidermist. Selecting a taxidermist can be almost as challenging as harvesting your new trophy.\nWhat Room will Display the Mounted Animal?\nWhere are you going to hang your new trophy mount? The room in which the mount will hang is a contributing factor on the pose you will select for the mount. There are so many poses available! If your ceilings are around 8\u2032 high or a basement den, the ceilings are not likely to be vaulted. How tall are the antlers? A full upright taxidermy pose might require the mount to hang low on the wall. There are three basic form poses \u2013 upright, semi-sneak, and full sneak. With an upright form, the neck is in a vertical position almost parallel to the wall. The semi sneak form has the neck and head down at approximate 40 degree angle off the wall. The full sneak pose has the neck at almost 85 degrees from the wall. For a low ceiling, a semi sneak or full sneak may be the better choice for your new trophy mount.\nTime to Interview The Taxidermist!\nWhere can I see some of your work? You need to look at their work very close. Look at the eyes, is it a natural look or does it look like the animal is bug eyed? Feel the back of the head between the antlers and slide your hand down the back of the neck. Do you feel the Stitches they used to sew the hide together? Has the hide shrunk? You will not notice this with true tanned hides.\nFound your Taxidermist \u201dEnjoy\u201d your Trophy!\nThe return time of your trophy mount is not as important as the above questions if you feel you have found the right taxidermist to do the mount for you. It should still be around 1 year, but 1 1/2 years is not uncommon! The Last this is the cost of the mount. How much is it worth to you? If you think you have found the right person to mount the animal the actual cost should not impact your decision. After all you get what you pay for!!\nBe Prepared buy a Quality Knife!\nYour knife is your best friend when you are in the outdoors and trying to survive. The survival knife is a tool that can be used in so many ways; it is the most invaluable tool you may possess. There are literally hundreds of different knives to choose from but you should be choosing one before you leave for the outdoors.\nBuy a Survival Knife that fits YOU!\nSize: You want your knife to be small enough to carry but large enough to be used to cut branches from trees, butcher meat and even for digging.\nSharpness: Your survival knife should be sharp at all times especially when you first purchase it, if it isn\u2019t sharp then, then it never will be.\nBalance: Your knife should have a good balance to it, meaning the blade and handle will complement each other. When you swing the knife, the weight if the blade should be doing a lot of the work. Try a few knives and you will notice how they differ in balance and pick the one that best suits you.\nGood Handle: The handle of the outdoor knife should be comfortable to use and preferably made of wood as this means it won\u2019t slip as much.\nIf possible try and get a knife that is fixed blade. This means that the blade of the knife doesn\u2019t fold in. A fixed blade knife is more reliable and safer to use as some folding knives don\u2019t lock well or can slip and cause injury. Always make sure your knife has a good sheath, leather is the best kind, and that it is sheathed when not in use.\nA Good \u201cSharpening Stone\u201d is a Must!\nThe proper care and maintenance of your knife is extremely important and should be a daily ritual when it is in use. Sharpening the blade is essential and the best way to do this is to purchase a sharpening stone. Diamond sharpeners and other type of sharpeners are good but none of these do as good a job as a sharpening stone in the hands of someone who knows how to use one. Your knife\u2019s blade should be sharpened to a point that is not too steep and is still thick enough not to chip.\nTo properly use a sharpening stone, it is best to dampen it first and then move the blade over the stone in a circular motion on angled so that you are removing the burrs and chips from the cutting edge, you will feel it when you get that perfect angle. When Sharpening the blade it must be simultaneously flipped to get the best cutting edge possible. A sharpened blade should have no burrs and the angle of the cutting edge should be constant.\nYour knife is your best friend when in a survival situation. Choosing the right Survival knife and maintain it by keeping it very sharp knife sharpener are lessons that should be learned before heading to the great outdoors for some Outdoor Survival fun.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T14:36:17Z", "url": "http://tntoutdoorexplosion.com/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

States such as Kazakhstan, Armenia, Georgia, Latvia, Ukraine and others sought to stand on their own and ponder their future. And they are making strides in their own humble way.\nIn South Sudan the 30 year political marriage was fought along national and religious lines. Those in the north are Arab and Islamic while those in the south, the new state, are African and Christian. Keeping them together proved to be a recipe for disaster.\nOne of the worthy sons of the African soil, former President Thabo Mvuyelwa Mbeki, was the main \u201cmidwife\u201d in the delivery room of this new born baby. We owe much to this African despite some having tried to downplay is effort to the extent of boasting about clipping is wings so that he could not deliver on the assignment. There is no doubt that Mbeki is wont to live his African dream and has to be supported as much as he has to be commended for a job well done.\nIndependence should of course not be treated like a Christmas party. Just like a funeral or a wedding, on the day of the occasion there are so many people that those involved hardly have anywhere to sleep of move but soon after the guests have left, the celebration over, the hosts are left to their destitution again. In independence the nation has to be fed, infrastructure has to be provided, governance has to be in place and above all peace is expected to reign. In South Sudan that is not the case as there are issues to sort out such as borders, their armies are still facing off against each other. The oil-rich province is the main bone of contention.\nThe call by Baleka Mbete, the national chairperson of the African National Congress, has to be supported. That country needs help and expertise to get it going. If South Africa is to lend a hand, we hope a South Africans of goodwill will be engaged.\nIt should not be a matter of only those in the majority party who are deployed there. We support Mbete\u2019s call that all those involved in whatever sector of business, be it manufacturing, mining, agriculture and technology should not be shy to establish themselves in that new country.\nLet us pray much the strength of Mbeki for his fortitude and the work that still lies ahead such as finding solutions to the serious outstanding issues. We hope the South African government will rise above their myopic and jaundiced judgment by making resources available to him as the success he achieves falls on the government to bask in.\nPresident Jacob Zuma should, as he promised on the occasion of the celebration of the South Sudanese independence, ensure that the infant state will be assisted to stand on its own feet lest the international communities make us a laughing stork.\nWe cross our fingers and hope this nation will grow to take its rightful place among other nations of the world.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T18:21:14Z", "url": "http://www.ucdp.org.za/jit_default_1174.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Scott Balcerek directed this new documentary about an unlikely musical partnership between Sterling \u2018Satan\u2019 Magee, a southern-born guitarist and Adam Gussow, a white, younger, Ivy League educated New York suburbanite harmonica player. It traces how Magee, after stints with such greats as Ray Charles, James Brown, King Curtis, got tired of seeing how black artists got exploited and took to the streets of Harlem to play strictly for the people. A chance encounter with Gussow, a grad school drop out and part-time street performer turned into a 12 year collaboration that took from the streets of New York to stages all over the world, a cover story in Living Blues magazine and an appearance in the U2 concert film and soundtrack Rattle & Hum. The doc also covers Gussow\u2019s efforts to reconnect with Magee, who, after suffering a nervous breakdown, stopped performing and all but disappeared, as well as their dramatic return in 2005. Though music plays a formative role , the love and mutual respect they have for each other is what really fuels the film. A doc that will move and inspire.

{"text": "Edith Grossman\u2019s translations recreate Spanish literature for English-language readers.\nEn espa\u00f1ol | Thanks to Edith Grossman\u2019s translations, the works of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Mayra Montero, Miguel de Cervantes, and others are more accessible to English-language readers. Her latest labor of love is The Golden Age: Poems of the Spanish Renaissance (August 2006).\nQ: What led you to work on contemporary texts?\nA: My first reading of Pablo Neruda\u2019s poetry.\nQ: Why return to your roots, the late 15th-17th centuries?\nA: Translating Don Quixote in 2003 was serendipitous. Once I recovered from my shock at the request, I realized how exciting it would be. Once back in the mindset of the Golden Age\u2026I thought it would be wonderful for people to get excited about [Renaissance] poetry.\nQ: How did you choose the works in this anthology?\nA: I chose poems I like very much by poets I like very much.\nQ: Can these poems have popular appeal?\nA: Poetry doesn\u2019t make for bestsellers, but I think these poems can appeal to readers because they are brilliant and beautiful poems.\nQ: How can Spanish Renaissance literature help us understand Latin American culture?\nA: The more a person reads great literature, the more that person understands the world. The human condition is similar enough throughout time to be open to the insight gained from literature.\nQ: How does an author\u2019s use of language affect the way you translate?\nA: If a writer is using an elaborate, baroque style\u2026or a very clean, spare style, I do my best to write that kind of English. I\u2019m trying to allow the reader in English to experience the text in a way that\u2019s comparable to the way the Spanish-language reader experiences it.\nQ: When you\u2019re working on contemporary literature, how collaborative is your approach to translation? Does the author have a role in the process?\nA: The author collaborates as much as he or she wants. Some authors are not interested in seeing the translation until it\u2019s published, and even then I\u2019m not sure if they look at it. Others like to see the translation before I submit it to the publisher. I\u2019m always glad to do that because they, of course, have an insight that\u2019s denied to everyone else in the world because it\u2019s their book. Normally I don\u2019t speak to the author about the translation until the very end, when there are always a handful of terms and words that require an explanation from the author.\nQ: Which authors whose works are only available in Spanish would you most like to see translated into English?\nA: There is a wonderful Spanish author named Carlos Rojas. I think one or two of his novels may have been translated into English, but not widely distributed. He is one of the most interesting novelists I\u2019ve read in any language. He\u2019s a remarkably talented, intelligent, gifted writer, and I think he\u2019s a great territory waiting to be discovered in English.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T18:01:50Z", "url": "https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/books/info-2006/translator_edith_grossman.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "The BMW 328 was the most successful sports car of the 1930\u2019s racing scene. At the time when powerful supercharged \u201cKompressor\u201d machines ruled the racing roost, the BMW 328 Roadster \u2013 weighing just 780 kilograms and developing a modest 80 horsepower in series production form \u2013 was a genuine sensation. The success of the BMW 328 lay in the sum of its parts: rigorously applied lightweight design, ideal weight distribution, aerodynamic lines, the perfect engine and a meticulously tuned chassis delivering flawless roadholding. All of which allowed it to underpin a fresh understanding of what a car could be, one which saw the engine\u2019s output teaming up with the optimum interplay of all the car\u2019s component parts \u2013 and complemented by maximum efficiency \u2013 to achieve success. These qualities enabled the BMW 328 to embody the values that still underpin the BMW brand today: dynamics, aesthetic appeal and a high degree of innovation.\nBMW 328 made its debut at the race track in June 14th, 1936. 34 runners were listed in the sports car category of the International Eifel Race. Seven of these were entered in the 2-litre class, and five were BMWs. Four were \u201cTyp 319/1\u201d cars, the other Ernst Jakob Henne\u2019s snow-white Roadster. The car stood out from the crowd, its body boasting far more flowing forms, a curved front end with a pair of slim, kidney-shaped air intakes similar to those of the BMW 326 presented at the Berlin Motor Show that spring, headlights integrated into the front wings, a low, sloping windscreen and a bulbous rear end. Out of sight, yet most certainly not out of mind after the car\u2019s lap times in practice, was the new engine lurking beneath the bonnet. The sound rumbling to the surface through the bonnet\u2019s two leather securing belts indicated the presence of a six-cylinder unit producing maybe 80 or even 90 horsepower.\nHenne\u2019s dream race and the premiere of the BMW 328 have gone down in N\u00fcrburgring folklore. But that wasn\u2019t the end of the story: the victory of the new sports car, whose internal designation \u201cBaumuster 328\u201d did not appear in any of the gushing race reports, marked the start of a legend.\nAnd so the BMW 328 had taken its maiden victory in its debut outing at the N\u00fcrburgring. The win was to be followed by more than 200 others over a lifespan that lasted into the 1950s. It was a run of success unparalleled by any other model in its class; few other cars have left such an enduring impression on the company\u2019s motor sport history as the BMW 328 with its 2.0-litre straight-six engine.\nAfter the triumph at the N\u00fcrburgring BMW set about conquering race tracks far and wide with a trio of BMW 328 prototypes. The universally positive reaction to the maiden victory of the new BMW sports car at the N\u00fcrburgring had sparked high expectations. There were some initial problems under sustained loads in the French Grand Prix at the high-speed Montlh\u00e9ry circuit, but the flow of fastest laps and victories soon resumed. As early as August that year British BMW im-porter H. J. Aldington swept to glory in the Schlei\u00dfheimer Dreiecksrennen race at the wheel of a BMW 328. And it was Aldington who urged the BMW top brass to enter another race outside Germany. A triumvirate of prototypes in green Frazer-Nash-BMW livery lined up for the Tourist Trophy in Ireland \u2013 and promptly sealed a clean sweep of the top three places.\nSince its maiden outing in the 1936 Eifel Race, the BMW 328 had quickly established an iron grip over Europe\u2019s race tracks. For the engineers in Munich, however, this was no reason to take their foot off the gas. Instead, they worked flat out on increasing the car\u2019s original output of 80 hp. Rival manufacturers had already boosted their engines to something around 110 hp, but a significant rise above that level was not expected. There was certainly little scope to further reduce the weight of what was already a lightweight car in standard production form. At that stage, reducing drag seemed like the only way to increase its speed. The curvaceous form of the 328, with its prominent front wings, may have been a masterstroke of engineering and design, but it was less than ideal aerodynamically. And so the BMW engineers set about designing a totally new body based on the latest knowledge from aerodynamics research. The Roadster was followed by a Touring Coupe and Kamm Coupe racing cars.\nThe BMW 328 continued to enjoy success in international competition into the 1950s. This makes it one of the most successful racing cars in BMW\u2019s long history in motorsport. Car races were far from a regular event in post-war Germany, but when they did happen, a handful of BMW 328 always featured prominently in the starting field. Many drivers carried out modifications to the aerodynamics and engine of their cars, and some even employed their own teams of mechanics. Indeed, independent drivers were now enriching the racing scene as designers, creating racing machines brimming with imagination and improvisation. Into the 1950s, more than 10 years after its introduction, the BMW 328 and its offspring from various body manufacturers were still dominating the 2-litre class.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T06:14:05Z", "url": "https://www.speeddoctor.net/2011/bmw-328-in-motorsport/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Do You Need a Master\u2019s in Education Degree To Qualify for Tenure?\nIf you are currently an educator or you are mapping out the route that you will take to become one, you may want to know if you need a Master in Education degree to qualify for tenure. To work as a full-time, tenure-track educator, you must meet certain requirements and prove that you are skilled and passionate about your role. Tenure offers you great protection in your career but every state and educational system has their own path that you must take. Read on, and find out when a master\u2019s is and is not required.\nWhat is a Tenure and Why is it So Important?\nTenure is technically defined as the right to due process so that high schools, colleges and other educational institutions cannot legally fire a teacher or professor without providing evidence that they are not competent or they have been inappropriate, according to the National Education Association. Since evidence must be provided and there is an entire process that school officials must follow, only about 2% of professors on the tenure-track lose their job annually.\nTo get your tenure, you must complete a probationary period and show that you are professional and competent in your role. While a professor is on probation, it is okay for the seniors in charge of hiring to fire the professor without cause at any time and go with a new faculty contract. The senior professors in charge of evaluation will work with administrators and new non-tenured faculty to evaluate their research capabilities and how they service the classroom to decide if they are deserving of tenure. If there are not recommended for tenure, the professor will lose their job and probation starts over when they begin under a new teaching contract.\nHow Long Does it Take to Become a Tenured Educator?\nOnly about one-third of college professors are tenured faculty, and this is a major cause for concern in the field. If you are hired on the tenure-track in a college setting, it typically will take about three years at a junior college and seven years at a four-year college to be granted tenure. If you are working in a high school, middle school or primary school, everything is based on the state law that applies to public schools.\nSome states have five-year requirements and others have 10-year requirements where all public school teachers are considered \u2018on probation\u2019. The average tenure-track duration in the United States is about seven years when you average the laws across the country.\nYou might assume that getting a graduate degree is the number one way for getting through probation, but that is not always the case. A master\u2019s degree in education will help you strengthen your knowledge on curriculum development, instruction, administration or counseling, but it is not centered around teaching specifically. It is more focused on the educational system than educating your students like a Master\u2019s of Arts in Teaching.\nOne drawback of having your master\u2019s before you are tenured is that it tempts the school to let go of you and secure a contract with a young, Bachelor\u2019s degree holding teacher who will cost less. If you wait until after you are tenured, the school cannot let you go because you decided to advance your education level.\nIf you would like to research types of M.Ed. programs that you can take and schools that offer them, it is time to seek out accredited programs. Once you know that you do not need a Master in Education degree to qualify for tenure, start focusing on teaching first and then focus on graduate programs.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T10:28:15Z", "url": "http://www.masters-degree-in-education.org/faq/do-you-need-a-masters-in-education-degree-to-qualify-for-tenure/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

This is due to the increasing availability of drones and their capabilities of travelling large distances and taking high resolution photographs and videos. From a criminological perspective, drones are an ideal method of smuggling, physically removing the operator from the act. It is for this reason that drones are also being utilised as deadly weapons in conflict areas. The need for forensic research to successfully analyse captured drones is rising. The challenges that drones present include the need to interpret flight data and tackling the multi-platform nature of drone systems. This paper reports the extraction and interpretation of important artefacts found in the recorded flight logs on both the internal memory of the UAV and the controlling application, as well as analysis of media, logs and other important files for identifying artefacts.

{"text": "Where you\u2019re from: I live in a place called Regensburg, one of the most beautiful towns in Bavaria (if I do say so myself)! The city is both old and new: its history goes all the way back to the 9th century and it was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006 for its uniquely well-preserved medieval Old Town. At the same time, the universities make it feel very young! It\u2019s a great place to have grown up.\nWhere and what you\u2019re studying: I am in the final stages of gaining my Bachelor\u2019s degree in political science and British Studies, having studied in Regensburg and Hong Kong.\nWhat is one project or activity you enjoyed at the Embassy?\nBeing an intern in the economics department at the embassy, the tariffs on steel and aluminium introduced by the United States during my time in DC had a great impact on my work: it was fascinating watching the political process at such proximity! I also really appreciated the department itself because it covers such a wide range of topics. For example, I was able to gain insights into farming and agricultural exports, the implications of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the US, but also the challenges of migration and developmental work by visiting various events around the city and aiding colleagues in their research.\nWhat do you think is one of Germany\u2019s main foreign policy challenges and what should Germany do about it?\nI can only echo what my fellow interns have mentioned in this section: finding and preserving unity \u2013 both domestically and within the EU \u2013, strengthening the transatlantic relationship and tackling the rise of populism around the world are issues that must be taken seriously. Likewise, making sure the art of diplomacy and skilled conversation is not lost in a world where a Tweet travels faster than actions.\nWhat are some cultural impressions you gained of the United States?\nI love how open and communicative people are in the US compared to Germany. Every conversation here starts with a \u201cHow are you?\u201d \u2013 be it a random person on the street or your Uber driver. If you ask cashiers in Germany about their well-being I can guarantee all you will get are strange looks.\nWhat has been your biggest surprise with regard to living in Washington?\nI have never been to a place that is more political than DC! This city lives and breathes politics, be it all the government agencies and organizations that are based here, the think tanks and the events they host, or everyday life in general. When you meet somebody here, chances are they work on the Hill, for the World Bank or an NGO. As a student of political science, the atmosphere in this place is a dream!\nWhat do you miss about Germany?\nApart from my family, friends and my dog I\u2019d have to say living in a small country! It\u2019s a weird thing to miss, I know. One of the joys of living in Europe is having so many different cultures, languages and traditions in such proximity. A four-hour drive is not considered a quick excursion as it is in the US! One thing I definitely don\u2019t miss, however, is not being able to do your shopping on a Sunday or after 8 pm. That\u2019s one convenience I have come to appreciate a lot and that will be sorely missed when it\u2019s time for me to return home.\nWhat has been your biggest lesson learnt during your internship?\nBe prepared for lots and lots of small talk! DC is the capital of networking. I have lost count of the amount of business cards people have given me during the two short months I have been here. Having a few easy topics of conversation on-hand makes life a lot easier!\nWhat has been your biggest challenge living here?\nDealing with all the single-use plastic. It is nearly impossible to avoid when doing the weekly shop and often it is utterly superfluous! It should not be possible to buy individually plastic-wrapped potatoes or pre-peeled eggs and oranges in plastic containers, yet these things are readily available at my local grocery store. I am glad, however, that DC has introduced a 5-cent plastic bag fee; it\u2019s definitely a step in the right direction.\nWhere do you plan to go or what do you plan to do after your internship?\nSadly, even the most fun internships must end someday\u2026 I will be returning home to Regensburg and will be greeted by an exam and term papers before finally finishing by Bachelor\u2019s thesis.

{"text": "Delicate & Whimsical Accessories with a Touch of the Sea's Beauty.\nStrings of Pearlescent Pastels Paired with Silver, Gold or Sparkles.\nStyle: Elegant, Graceful & \"Pearl Kissed\"\nToday you can find trendy jewelry to suit any style, bold, colorful, sparkly, even nerdy. But pieces that are beautifully understated in their elegance can be more of a challenge to come across. Perhaps because it's easy to overdo, but timelessness takes balance and the right materials like those favored by Ellen vanHully-Bronson of Pearl Kissed Jewelry. Most of Ellen's collections are centered around one of Mother Nature's most delicate and classic \"gems\" - the fresh water pearl. Her necklaces, bracelets and earrings are all handmade and one-of-a-kind, much like each naturally derived pearl. Her designs are meant to convey an air of elegance and romance, from her simpler strings of silver and the occasional pearl bead or crystal to the more intricate signature necklace with woven \"branches\" that sit gracefully along your neckline. Ellen's pieces make wonderful gifts for moms, daughters, sisters, wives and more. A Pearl Kissed necklace can enhance any outfit, from the more casual to an evening dress. They are that charming and versatile. While Ellen has a handful of self-designed collections, she is happy to discuss custom requests for a piece that's as special as its future wearer. That makes her work very well suited for bridal parties to match the romance you want on your special day! I love how creativity runs in Ellen's family, with this business originally started as a mother - daughter duo. Her daughter then continued to follow her passions to metalwork, but still offers input on design and marketing to help drive success.

{"text": "The Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has charged newly inducted land surveyors by the Surveyors Council of Nigeria to exhibit a high sense of professionalism in the discharge of their duties.\nFashola, who gave the charge at the 2018 induction ceremony for 267 new surveyors by SURCON, which held recently in Abuja, welcomed and congratulated them for making it as members of the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors.\nRepresented by the Minister of State II for Power, Works and Housing, Suleiman Hassan, Fashola urged the inductees to strictly abide by the standards of the profession they had chosen to pursue.\nHe said, \u201cI urge you, as you collect your certificates today, to go and practice professionally, knowing that this government, more than ever before, believes so much in the contribution of professionals so that it can bring about the desired infrastructural development.\n\u201cThe Federal Government has invested seriously in infrastructure. In the real sector alone, we have made the commitment of about N2.7tn. Commitments have been made in sectors like agriculture, mining and roads, among others.\nEarlier in his address, the President of SURCON, Joseph Agbenla, noted that with the 267 newly inducted members, the number of registered surveyors in the country had increased to 3,627.\nHe urged the inductees to uphold the ethics of the profession and stressed that anyone found wanting in the course of practice would have his or her certificate, which remains a property of SURCON, withdrawn.\n\u201cI am highly confident that you will always remember that the seal and the certificate you are all having today belong to the Surveyors Council of Nigeria and may be recalled by the council if your professional conduct contradicts the rules, regulations and ethics of the surveying profession,\u201d Agbenla said.\nThe Surveyor-General of the Federation, Ebisintei Awudu, advised the inductees to keep enhancing their capacity and ensure that their practice add more value to the profession.\nHe said surveyors should strive to improve their skills in order to adequately understand how to use the tools provided by the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation.\nAwudu stated, \u201cBy the constitution of Nigeria, the OSGOF is principally mandated to do cadastral, geological and several other types of surveys. So try and improve your capacity on these aspects.\nDespite the poor performance of the real estate industry and the lull in the property market in recent times, stakeholders have expressed optimism of a full recovery this year.\nThe Statistician-General of the Federation and Chief Executive Officer, National Bureau of Statistics, Dr. Yemi Kale, said although the real estate industry, which contributed 6.79 per cent to real Gross Domestic Product, dropped to 4.12 per cent in the third quarter of 2017, with interest rates currently steady within the lower double-digits and monetary policy keeping a keen eye on inflation trends and minimising inflationary pressure, stakeholders in real estate sector should expect a recovery.\nKale and others spoke at the Real Estate Outlook 2018 Conference convened by AlphaCrux Limited with the theme, \u2018The aftermath of recession: Where do we go from here\u2019.\nThe statistician-general, who was represented at the event by his Technical Adviser, Lola Talabi-Oni, said the Nigerian economy, despite being susceptible to internal shocks such as insecurity, and external shocks from fluctuating global oil prices, among others, would, according to the World Bank forecast, experience modest growth in 2018.\nHe stated, \u201cThe strong momentum of the global economy is expected to continue into 2018 with a forecasted global GDP growth of 3.9 per cent by the IMF. Here in Africa, the Sub-Saharan region is not left out of the global economic recovery as the IMF forecasts a growth of 3.3 per cent and 3.9 per cent within the region for 2018 and 2019, respectively.\nKale said the dip in real estate\u2019s contribution to the GDP, from 6.79 per cent to 4.12 per cent in the third quarter of 2017, came as a surprise but noted that the industry performed better during that same quarter than it did in the same period the year before.\n\u201cThe continued disinflation within the economy should therefore be good news to stakeholders within the real estate sector,\u201d he added.\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Northcourt Real Estate, Tayo Odunsi, said real estate, as part of the larger economy, could not be said to be in growth, but was rather still recovering from the economic woes of the previous quarters.\nOdunsi stated that industry players needed to conceptualise innovative concepts necessary to deepen it and fast-track growth.\nHe noted that the key considerations that could shape the property market this year were the declining vacancy rate across cities and the office market shifting towards co-working space due to its flexibility as well as investors preferring smaller retail malls.\n\u201cWith millennials accounting for 70 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s population, developers are forced to come up with innovative developments like students\u2019 housing and other affordable schemes as young people now have preference for smaller apartments rather than investors building sprawling apartments with no occupants,\u201d he said.\nThe Managing Director, Uraga Real Estate Limited, Dr Gbadamosi Yakubu, stated that government across levels should start thinking of collaborating with the industry players to bring about the desired change.\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s plan towards affordability is key and it must start from land allocation to ease access to land,\u201d he said.\nA chartered surveyor and valuer and President, Nigerian-British Chamber of Commerce, Akin Olawore, stated that there was a need for a change of attitude towards homeownership in the country in terms of funding.\n\u201cAs Nigerians\u2019 attitude continues to change towards house ownership, we have to seek innovative and ingenious ways of funding rather than rely on government\u2019s spending, especially now that young people dominate the population,\u201d he said.\nThe Director of Operations, Andela, Anthonio Pinhiero, who spoke on the role of technology in solving housing challenges in the country, stated that stakeholders could deploy technology to drive decision-making process in the property market.\n\u201cSince technology has come to stay, it will continue to disrupt the market from the demand end to the supply end, making it a lot easier for consumers to participate within the property market space,\u201d he added.\nThe Managing Director, Alphacrux, Mr. Tobi Adama, noted that the impact of the last recession as well as a successful first edition of the conference had made it necessary to bring stakeholders together to discuss trends and issues in the industry.\n\u201cThe recession had an impact we were not quite ready for but we got out of it as swiftly as we got in; and now, the way we deal with the aftermath is the crucial thing on our hands,\u201d he said.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-20T22:31:16Z", "url": "https://housingnews.org.ng/category/latest-housing-news/page/90/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

This time in your life can be exciting and overwhelming all at once. It\u2019s important to take good care of yourself during your pregnancy and regularly visit all of your healthcare practitioners. Believe it or not, it\u2019s especially important to visit your dentist in Weatherford throughout your pregnancy. Here are the reasons why.\nBecause of the many hormone changes that take place throughout pregnancy, you are more susceptible to periodontal disease, or gum disease during this time. This may not seem like too big a deal, however periodontal disease can lead to tooth, tissue, and bone loss if it\u2019s not properly managed. A condition known as pregnancy gingivitis can occur, and this is actually the first stage of gum disease.\nIf you notice that your gums are red and swollen, or bleed when you brush your dentist may recommend extra cleaning appointments during your pregnancy to help you control the gingivitis. Excellent home care, with daily brushing and flossing is also crucial during this time. If you suffer from morning sickness and vomiting, your dentist can recommend a mouth rinse to help protect your teeth from harmful stomach acids.\nAs you know, your nutrition is very important to you and your baby during pregnancy, did you know however, that your nutrition could affect your baby\u2019s developing teeth? It\u2019s true! Your baby\u2019s teeth will begin to develop around the third to sixth month of your pregnancy and you need lots of vitamin A, C, and D as well as protein and calcium to help your child\u2019s teeth develop properly. You will need to begin oral care for your child as well as soon as their first teeth erupt.\nLet your dentist know that you\u2019re pregnant and exactly what trimester you\u2019re in. your dentist may want to wait on taking x-rays or performing dental treatment until you\u2019re further along in your pregnancy.\nIf you experience dental pain or an emergency contact your dentist right away. There are a lot of things that can be done for dental pain during your pregnancy even if you don\u2019t have treatment done immediately. Remember, the earlier you contact us if you\u2019re experiencing dental pain, the faster we can diagnose your situation and get you feeling comfortable again.\nDr. Deborah Romack and Dr. Garrett Mulkey are your premiere family dentists in Aledo, TX. At Cosmetic & Family Dentistry our team is here to support you through your pregnancy and beyond. We welcome patients of all ages to our practice and we look forward to helping you welcome your little one and serving their dental needs as well when the time comes!\nby: tntadmin at April 1, 2016 .\nComments Off on Why is it Important to See a Dentist in Weatherford While You\u2019re Pregnant?", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T14:08:22Z", "url": "https://www.weatherfordfamilydentist.com/blog/why-is-it-important-see-dentist-in-weatherford-while-youre-pregnant/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Finding a high quality photographer for your family portrait, wedding or other special events can be daunting, to say the least. A professional photographer with local insider Lynn Haven knowledge can give you more than just an experienced person on the end of the camera, but someone who knows the best local places to shoot and can give your photos a more authentic local feel.\nOur portfolio of work is available upon request? So, depending on what kind of photographs you need, we can offer a great studio in Lynn Haven or we can photograph outdoors in or around the city if you prefer\u2026or both, if you prefer. The object is to capture and convey your unique appeal, no matter where we take the photographs. So please reach out to us and we\u2019d be more than happy to provide you with as much information as you need, as well as offering testimonials, so you can decide if we\u2019re the professional photographer service that you would like to carry out your photography work here in Lynn Haven. We look forward to speaking to you soon!\nWith our significantly growing technical world we live in it\u2019s becoming more regular that we come across people who are debating whether they need to employ a professional photographer. Why not simply take them yourself? Or better yet, have a good friend or family member with a good camera take the photos? Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoy the fact many people have access to technology that can help them photograph their day to day lives; but, when it comes to important events, milestones, business headshots, personal shoots, and your wedding, it is important that you employ a professional! There is a lot more that goes into expert photography than having great equipment \u2026 So today, I am sharing with you the TOP SIX REASONS why you ought to think about employing an expert photographer.\n1) Consistent Results \u2013 In my opinion, I think 2 key components of an expert golfer are consistency and versatility. For example, an excellent golfer that plays the regional course twice a week every week, might have the ability to par the course regularly, but that golfer might not be that consistent when having to adapt to an entirely new course and especially a difficult course. but an expert golfer can not only shoot par and way much better in many cases regularly, but they can also adapt to a brand-new course. This is similar to the way an expert photographer works. An expert photographer can be consistent in various scenarios by adapting to the surrounds based upon knowledge. This consistency, adaptability and knowledge are all things that produce quality results from the professional photographer.\n2) Equipment \u2013 Some pros might not agree with me on this, but ask them exactly what they shoot with. You will likely discover that it\u2019s not the most recent low-end consumer DSLR. It\u2019s true that equipment alone does not magically make someone professional photographer. So just to clarify, if someone goes to the camera shop in the morning and spends thousands of dollars, that doesn\u2019t mean she or he is instantly professional. Nevertheless, for those genuinely doing photography as a career, there is typically a significant investment that comes with that career choice. One camera bag might have countless dollars worth of financial investment inside it. You wouldn\u2019t use a professional in other fields that don\u2019t have the right equipment to do the job, so don\u2019t use a photographer who bought a camera, a kit lens and a flash on Saturday and magically Monday morning they are a pro. In the BIG brand name photography world, it\u2019s most likely these photographers will not be going after that business. but small business owner beware, make certain the photographer is equipped to carry out the task and provide exceptional quality.\n3) It\u2019s Your Brand \u2013 Your brand is very important and professional photography is a simple way to make your brand name stand out. It\u2019s true that in the digital age that you or your friend armed with a good camera can get some shots that may be just sufficient for the Internet and look excellent. Nevertheless, with a little financial investment for a true professional photographer, your brand name might go from average to great. Perception is everything. Invest in professional photographer and not someone who just takes good pictures that may just be good enough.\n4) You Get What You Pay For \u2013 OK, you don\u2019t always get exactly what you pay for and in some cases high price is not as good as cheap. Nevertheless, when you are working with a real skilled professional photographer and are really comparing apples to apples, it\u2019s likely that the cheapest photographer out there will not deliver equivalent outcomes. Although the inexpensive photographer could be a philanthropist and be fantastic, it\u2019s likely that too cheap will just yield good outcomes and not excellent ones. A buddy of mine sent me some examples of a professional photographer\u2019s work just recently together with what the photographer desired for the images, I was surprised at the results and the price. Why did my buddy not go with me? He knows that I am not the cheapest option for his requirements and just uses me for his bigger budget jobs. FYI, I am not crazy high price. There are services that professional photographer will offer that are an excellent fit for small businesses.\n5) Professional Editing \u2013 In the consumer market, it\u2019s not unusual for a brand-new photographer to shoot a session and burn a huge number of images to a disc and they are done. A real professional cares more about their work and credibility than to just turn over a disc of the images. Real professional photographers edit their work even if it\u2019s just a fast run through of Adobe Lightroom. However, some images need large amounts of attention which could take a number of minutes to an hour plus just to appropriately modify one image. Ask if the photographer you are considering edits their work. This is one easy way for the photographer to save you some money and them time but likely provide good results vs. great.\n6) Because He or She Is Professional \u2013 A true professional photographer will act in professional manner in the way they do business. There is something to be said in any business about professionalism. A plumber may not be looked at like an attorney, but the plumber should still treat you with respect, as well as respecting your residence by not walking on your carpet in muddy shoes and provide services in a manner that leaves you feeling 100% satisfied! A professional photographer, especially in the world of business, ought to not only provide great photography services but make you feel happy by his/her mindset.\nOur lives on this earth are short-lived, but photographs are timeless! Leave a piece of you with those you love in still images. Give them something to remember you by, to keep, to value. I hope that after reading this you will think about hiring a professional photographer for all your photography needs. carry out some research! Find a photographer who\u2019s style you like, and take some time to connect with them. Finding and selecting the correct photographer will leave you with incredible memories and beautiful photographs to enjoy for a life time.\nLynn Haven is a city in Bay County, Florida, United States, north of Panama City.

{"text": "Perhaps you make a good point there bizaro. My past experience in following FFH's investments has made me gun shy of doing that. These guys are in a different game and this could be a sound idea.\n1) Lundin is a much larger company (by market cap) than Yamana. They have more financial resources to fund the $250 million expansion projects at Chapada (throughout increase and Sucupira pit pushback).\n2) Lundin is a copper-focused company. Chapada is primarily a copper mine with significant gold credits. Lundin spends a lot of money aggressively exploring for copper at its properties. The Yamana copper reserves and resource growth will likely ramp up under Lundin's exploration team.\nThis is more or less the entire argument, if you ask me. Just can take a LOOOOONG time to play out given how long cycles last and how long it takes to get a mine from idea to production.\nBHP makes a strategic investment in Midland, way above current market price. C$5.9 million raised at 1.70 a share.\nBHP gets right of first offer on Mythril. If the drilling hits BHP wants the project because it is potentially a very large copper deposit (based upon the IP surveys).\nLundin conference call emphasizes that they have no capital constraints compared to Yamana. They plan to bring copper production forward in an aggressive manner. I expect the gold-only Suruca deposit to be shelved, while Chapada expansion timeline will be accelerated. Yamana had been slowplaying the major expansion spending to try to keep a cash flow positive profile for a few years.\nI can imagine the conservatives putting political pressure on the utilities to delay the coal power plant conversions a few years to save thousands of coal mine or coal power plant related jobs. Phaseout is inevitable but the exact timing is still up in the air, especially for the Genesee plants.\nWolfden Resources cutting timber for forest management has been kicking out revenue to Altius. Altius gets 20% of the sales receipts from timber sales. Altius received C$92,232 in timber revenue in 2018, and has received C$66,299 so far in 2019. See Wolfden\u2019s most recent MD&A. I believe these sales receipts become part of Altius\u2019s project generation revenue.\nThese regular sales are separate from what will eventually be a total sale of the Mt. Pickett timber rights (for at least US$5 million).\nBecause the total sale of timber rights didn\u2019t happen by November 2018 Altius can now, at any time, demand the return of what it paid for the Mt. Pickett royalty, C$7.663 million, in cash or shares of Wolfden.\nWolfden was a speculative royalty deal but Altius built some excellent protections into the deal.\nStrong Q1 performance and raised guidance. Potash is performing very well.\nAltius should be in striking range for C$90 million total revenue in 2019 (royalty and project generation revenue). This preliminary Q1 royalty number doesn\u2019t include ~C$300K from Voisey\u2019s Bay and PG revenue (timber sales etc). LIF must keep paying out and Chapada should have a big second half of the year with the improved recovery circuits installed this quarter. Maybe a couple hundred thousand extra revenue from Excelsior in Q4.\n90 million would be quite a reach. I will stick with 80 million for the year. Lundin buying Chapada, UCP win, highest quarter royalty revenue record, raised guidance and Altius barely moves. I think CapitalCities comment about the market not caring sums it up nicely.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T20:41:48Z", "url": "http://www.cornerofberkshireandfairfax.ca/forum/investment-ideas/als-to-altius-minerals/7140/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "Between Pride of the Clouds and Thunderclap Wyvern, I'd try and go all-in on the flying theme! Favorable Winds , Warden of Evos Isle and Esper Stormblade would all be useful additions to that end.\nThe decklist looks cool, some suggestions. If you are going to run Delver of Secrets Flip you are gonna need a lot more spells and scrying so that it can be flipped more consistantly (Also run 4 of Delver, and 4 Pteramander. Cut out Mistcloaked Herald). That also works well with Pteramander so you can adapt it a bit easier. The one thing that you REALLY should run is Remand , it is a great tempo play, and you also draw another card. Spell Pierce is great. Serum Visions for the scrying. A great budget option for blue is Nimble Obstructionist , since it is a flying threat with flash AND can counter any activated or triggerd ability you do not control. Depending on your budget you really cannot go wrong with Snapcaster Mage , since you can reuse any spell. Vendilion Clique is great for tempo, another threat in the air and lets you take an important card from your opponents hand it is great against combo decks. I would take out Favorable Winds since it is a bit slow and Pteramander , Tempest Djinn and Delver of Secrets Flip are great finishers, seems a bit redundant. Not so sure about the Unstable Mutation but i do se the appeal of it. These are just some suggestions and it kinda depends on what direction you want to take it in, your budget and if you want it to be competative. Hope this helps in any way.\n-2 summary judgment +2 Favorable Winds +1 though for running W/U without a Tbag in it.\nGood start. To pump your fliers use Favorable Winds . I would replace Curiosity for Curious Obsession if your budget permits. And maybe Jace's Phantasm as a cheap solution for graveyard decks.

{"text": "Today\u2019s workplace is not the same as it has been in other times. Working after retirement from need and/or desire has made retiree employment a game changer, benefiting employers with talented and mature help as well as retirees with more exciting jobs. Retirees are sought after by an increasing number of companies, and many retirees are finding life-affirming work to help them live life as they want to live it in retirement.\nWhen companies need someone skilled but without a strict schedule requirement for short-term projects, retirees save the day. Oftentimes, they already know the job well enough to require little to no training, and their flexible schedule makes a big difference. Companies sometimes retain the contact information of their employees when they retire so they can invite them to return as needed for reliable work. If there\u2019s not enough of past employees to fit their need, they\u2019ll also seek out new retirees skilled in the industry for the same purpose.\nMany companies are also embracing seniors and retirees for more regular part-time work because they\u2019ve seen that there is a wealth of untapped talent here.\nSome companies, such as PKF O\u2019Connor Davies, are deliberately campaigning for new senior and retiree talent.\nRetirement is an ideal time to pursue a job that suits your interests: hostess at a restaurant, for instance; work with kids in a daycare; or get a job as a receptionist.\nCoolWorks: check it out for yourself!

{"text": "So yesterday I had my first session of skin peeling with Dr Mohamed Gharib, a professional Dermatologist at Kaya Skin Clinic (Marina Branch). My consultation which was around a week ago, was so informative. Dr Gharib made me feel so comfortable about the whole procedure which is why I went ahead with his recommendation of skin peeling and mesotherapy. At the consultation he asked me what my concerns were regarding my skin to which I explained how due to having to wear make up so often because of my career, my skin sometimes breaks out with mild acne. I also told him how I\u2019m unhappy with the hollowness and darkness around my eye area. Even after having just one consultation, it was so invaluable. Dr Gharib made me understand what\u2019s going on with my skin and why. It all makes so much sense now, meaning I can do as much as I can within my control to help my skin improve. I don\u2019t want to bombard you with too much text so please follow my YouTube channel www.youtube.com/ninaubhi where I will be uploading the final journey of my experience of Skin Peeling and Mesotheraphy once I\u2019ve completed all four sessions. I\u2019ll also be posting on my blog after each session so I can really give you my full experience.\nSESSION ONE I\u2019ve been sick for the last few days and thankfully I felt well enough to go out yesterday afternoon. So luckily I made it for my first session of skin peeling and mesotherapy at the Kaya Skin Clinic. Firstly, the staff at Kaya Skin Clinic are so professional and they made the whole process so much easier and secondly they have a branch in Marina which is so close to me! Skin Peel: So I arrived with zero make up on and settled down in the treatment room. The nurse started by firstly explaining the process and then cleansing my face to remove any residue. Then comes the high frequency Accura machine that is glided across my skin manually by the nurse, continuously for around 10 minutes; this calms any inflammation and reduces the size of spots. She then started the skin detox by extracting any open comedones. Once the skin is cleansed, Dr Gharib applies the skin peel treatment over my face and it\u2019s left on for a few minutes. There\u2019s a slight tingling sensation but nothing too uncomfortable. The skin peel treatment is removed by spraying cold water onto the face and pressing it off with a thick towel/gauze followed by some ice over the skin to cool it down. After this my skin felt totally normal and after an hour or so a little tight. I\u2019ve been told my skin may feel dry and tight which it has but it\u2019s not peeling like you assume it would be by the sound of the name. Mesotherapy: The nurse applied numbing cream to my under eyes and eyelids. After leaving it on for 20 minutes Dr Gharib then removed the cream and started injecting vitamins into the skin around the eyes. It didn\u2019t hurt at all, thankfully due to the numbing cream.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a relaxing and soothing facial type experience then this isn\u2019t it. But it\u2019s also not uncomfortable. It\u2019s a treatment to help clear up your skin and I love the fact I already feel it working. It\u2019s only been a day and I\u2019m looking forward to my next session. Each session of the skin peel needs to be 15 days apart and the mesotherapy needs to be every week.\nTo book a consultation with Dr Gharib contact Kaya Skin Clinic on +971 4 4508438.\nMesotherapy is getting great results, it hurts a little in you don\u2019t use a proper anesthetic but no one can argue with the results.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T00:55:04Z", "url": "https://ninaubhi.com/skin-peel-mesotherapy-session-1-kaya-skin-clinic/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

They say that, but they do not believe it\" (p. 50).\nKarl Idsvoog's journal article, \"TV sitting on stories to improve ratings,\" claims that \"the decision on when (or if) to run a piece is no longer determined just by asking is the report concise, clear, and well produced; is it fair, thorough and accurate?

{"text": "San Diego, CA \u2013 When last we saw the Chevy Blazer, it was 2005. Mariah Carey was topping the charts. George W. Bush was starting his second term as U.S. president. Hamid Karzai was the new leader of the \u201cliberated\u201d Afghanistan.\nAnd the Blazer? Well, the SUV built on the frame of a S-10 pickup was ready to retire.\nNow, after a 14-year break, Chevrolet has brought back a mid-sized crossover SUV under the name Blazer. But, other than the name, you\u2019d be hard pressed to connect the new SUV with the rough-and-ready truck from yesteryear.\nBlazer is five-passenger, two-row crossover that fits between the compact Equinox and three-row Traverse.\nIt is attractive \u2013 much better looking \u2013 than the original, and displays far superior road manners. Its smooth and quiet ride is a credit to unibody construction, instead of the old body-on-frame. It\u2019s also more fuel-efficient, thanks to stop/start technology, cylinder deactivation in the V6 and a smooth-shifting nine-speed automatic that always seems to know the right gear.\nIts frisky RS trim level is the hot rod of the family. It has the boldest look, with a blacked-out front end and black up-sized 21-inch wheels (from standard 18-inch). It looks especially good on a bright red body colour. Its engine growl is just loud enough to let you know the optional 3.6-litre V6 means business, cranking out a respectable 305 hp and 269 lb.-ft. of torque.\nThe Premier trim level is more dignified, with generous chrome treatment on the outside and quality accented leather interior treatment. Automatic heated steering wheel and heated/ventilated front seats tie in with the automatic climate control system. The windows can be opened remotely to let cabin heat out as you approach the car.\nAll models have HID headlamps mounted low and LED daytime running lights.\nCargo space is an impressive 1,818 litres with the rear seated folded. A rail-based system allows the space to be configured and blocked off as needed to secure items, and the rails store neatly in front of the spare tire when not needed.\nThere are some nifty touches to this vehicle \u2013 like a hands-free power liftgate with a light that shines a Chevy emblem on the ground to show you where to swing your foot. Inside, the rear seat slides forward to allow more cargo space and tilts back to allow extra headroom \u2013 unnecessary, since a six-footer can easily fit with the seat upright.\nChevrolet\u2019s updated Infotainment 3 system comes with 8.0-inch touchscreen, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. There are up to six USB ports \u2013 even the new USB type-C standard \u2013 wireless phone charging, and a subscription-based 4G LTE WiFi hot spot. Active noise cancelling is standard on all trim levels. The rearview camera \u201chitch view\u201d makes hooking up to a trailer a one-person job.\nChevy started with the platform found on the XT5 and Acadia models, but it moved the wheels 44 millimetres further out to gain a squatter, planted feel, said Larry Mihalko, Chevy\u2019s vehicle performance manager.\nThe sporty RS also has high rate suspension springs, heavy stabilizer bars, sport-turned dampers and oversized shock absorbers. Although a relatively tall vehicle, the clever engineers have made this SUV feel very sportscar-like.\nIts frisky RS trim level is the hot rod of the family. It has the boldest look, with a blacked-out front end and black up-sized 21-inch wheels (from standard 18-inch).\nThe active yaw control system inputs traction data 100 times per second and adjusts power to each wheel. In hard cornering, it sends up to 80 per cent of the power to the outside rear wheel to push the SUV in the right direction.\nDrivers can also switch to front-wheel drive to cut fuel consumption under highway conditions. Fuel economy ranges around 9 litres/100 km in combined city/highway driving. The stock 2.5-litre turbo-charged four-cylinder offers a marginal gain in fuel economy over the six, and delivers 193 hp and 188 lb.-ft. of torque.\nA trip to the hills east of San Diego, Calif., confirms that this is an able highway cruiser, but no off-road bruiser. It comes equipped with street tires and a low front end that would whither at the first sight of a rock.\nEven so, there\u2019s much to like in this revived Blazer. The entry-level basic model starts at just over C$30,000 in Canada, is well-equipped and offers good value. The highest trim levels, however, are more than C$50,000 \u2013 definitely pushing the limits of the category, which includes Mazda CX5, Ford Edge, Nissan Murano, and Toyota Highlander.\nYou don\u2019t have to go high-end to get a fun ride with the Blazer. Whatever configuration you choose, it feels like a sturdy and stable vehicle designed for city and highway driving.\nThe Blazer is available for order across North America now.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T09:55:50Z", "url": "https://tractionlife.com/2019-chevrolet-blazer-first-drive-review/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

His external examiner was Dr Gary Wills from the University of Southampton and the internal was Dr Andr\u00e9s Peratta.\nThe main objective of this work was to develop architecture and carry out the implementation of a fully automated knowledge representation system, capable of rendering textual documents from various unstructured sources, online or offline, into a single web knowledge base where navigation was automatically provided by the system. This navigation was carried out using the principles of natural browsing.\nThe system architecture was developed in two main parts: data preparation and interactive knowledge representation. Novel approaches were introduced in both the data compression and representation parts to overcome difficulties that had prevented the construction of comprehensive full cycle systems in the past.\nThe data preparation employed modern information retrieval techniques, such as search engine elements, and represented the documents corpus as vector space. However, a distinguishing part was the application of the dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the vector space while keeping the relevance calculation features by reducing the dimensionality on initial vector space to intrinsic dimensionality value.\nThe interactive knowledge representation implemented the innovative concept of a \u2018live\u2019 navigational panel powered with evolutionary algorithms. This was achieved through the system of rules divided into two algorithms serving both dormant and active cycles of user-system interaction.\nAs a result of his research, both examiners recommended the award of Doctor of Philosophy.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T19:12:44Z", "url": "https://www.wessex.ac.uk/news/graduation-ceremonies/757-taras-filatov-phd", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

As Obama continues to strengthen sanctions and keep all options on the table to stop Iran, Romney has a top \u201cspecial adviser\u201d who actually lobbied for companies that did business with Iran.\nThat is quite the opposite.\nWorse, this is endemic of a party-wide challenge that the GOP seems to be having with regard to doing the right thing on Iran\u2014whether to side with big business or strengthening Iran sanctions, as evidenced by the fifth party-line House GOP vote to side with former over the latter.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T20:58:50Z", "url": "http://d22all9zt2shnx.cloudfront.net/media/entry/romny071712.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "A new EU Drivers Hours and Tachograph Law has just gone into effect, and it will impact owners of panel vans, 4x4 pickups and sports utility vehicles that use their vehicles for towing for business. The new law indicates that vehicles with a Gross Mass over 3,500kg must be fitted with a tachograph that will record the driver and vehicle\u2019s activities. Gross Mass is calculated as the weight of the vehicle as well as the trailer towed behind it. In order to be in compliance, drivers not only need to have the tachograph, but also obey hours regulations. Unfortunately, not all of the smaller vehicles that now fall under the requirement are able to be fitted with the devices. Both van manufacturers and tachometer manufacturers need to find solutions.\nThis law was not an issue previously, as until recently vehicles Gross Mass was lower than 3,490kg. But as vehicles have improved in their capabilities and are now able to tow caravans, the change was deemed to be necessary.\nPrivate vehicles being used to tow caravans are not impacted by the law, but if you are a business carrying extra equipment or supplies via caravan behind your van, the requirements apply. The fleet industry, which often uses vans to tow caravans, should note that if a tow bar is being attached to a vehicle then the tachometer needs to be installed as well.\nCar manufacturers that have not previously needed to be able to equip these devices onto their vehicles are working to find a fix in order to prevent drivers from being open to prosecution.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T12:22:20Z", "url": "https://www.foraymotorgroup.co.uk/news/article/new-fleet-legislation-impacts-panel-vans", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
{"text": "I recently went on a trip with my youngest daughter to Atlanta, Georgia. I had not been to Georgia before. I used to live in Alabama and Florida (at different times), so I figured it would be mostly the same. What I didn't know was that Atlanta is Gotham City. You may not have known this, and I'm sorry if I'm ruining some fantasy-other-wordliness aspect of Gotham City, but....it's in Georgia.\nOur adventure began when we got the rental car and headed out in the safe hands of GPS (aka evil maniacal devil guide) to our hotel. I don't know when I decided Siri was a reliable source again. She has burned me way too many times in the past for me to have any sane reason to trust her, but here I was, across the country in the middle of a rainy night, trusting my life to the voice in my phone with a desire to kill me.\nHow do I know she wants to kill me? Let's recap. I have gotten lost more times than not when using her. Usually it is because she decides to tell me to take U turns in the middle of freeways or busy roads. Other times it is because she leads me to my destination which actually turns out to be a lonely spot in the middle of nowhere, perfect for murder. This time, it was to the back side of a prison. Yes, just pull into the guarded driveway...don't mind the guns...\"your destination is on the right\"....sure it is. I didn't fall for it.\nI had a feeling that no matter what Siri said, I should probably head towards the taller, better lighted buildings in the distance. By some miracle, we ended up at our hotel. I prefer to believe it was devine guidance. On the way, we discovered we were in Gotham. It wasn't hard to tell, all we had to do was look up. The buildings were somewhat shrouded in fog. Did I mention it was raining? Constantly? The entire weekend? The fog swirled around the tops of the buildings. One building in particular had lights shining off the top, cutting through the fog, just waiting for the Bat signal to be blasted into the sky. It was Gotham. I'm sure of it. If that wasn't enough proof, the sirens that screamed all night were the clincher. I didn't actually SEE Batman, but I'm pretty sure I saw something dark and caped streak past my 9th floor hotel window in the middle of the night.\nThe rest of our trip went fairly well. We went to a Art walk/block party, very much NOT like the art walks here in Arizona. I expected to see cool art that made my mind scream, \"How did they think of that!?\" like what happens at the art walks here. Instead, what my mind was screaming was more of a, \"WHY did they think of that? What is wrong with them!?\" My daughter assured me it was all about the experience, not the product. That had to be the only resoning behind the live music in the \"Mammal Bar\" which turned out to be a very warm, over crowded room (bar), with a group of adult size toddlers playing on xylophones, recorders, and bongos....with no apparent melody in common. My brain hurt and I wanted to curl up with something familiar, like a cactus. It was painful.\nAll in all, I totally enjoyed my trip with my daughter. She is an awesome person. I'd want to be her friend if we weren't related. She's totally cool. She is also blessed/cursed with the same talent as I have. We both see celebrity faces in random people. On this trip we saw young DiCaprio, Ice T's uncle, A white Bruno Mars, and the perfect blend of Bradley Cooper and Will Arnett. I admit to following the latter around with my eyes for quite a while and even snapping a picture. Is that weird? It's not like I'm going to stalk him or google his picture online and find out his name and whether or not that girl with him was his girlfriend or send him bunnies or anything, it was purely for research.\nHave never asked Siri anything but have of course used a GPS well Tim has I have never even tried to punch in an address in one. They are great except when they get you lost or send you down a one way street the wrong way and that has happened a few time to me and Tim.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T18:37:47Z", "url": "http://mormonmommywriters.blogspot.com/2015/09/dopple-gang.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

Our practice has been not just to put forward a simple legal theory, but to sufficiently analyze the situation our client companies are in and provide forward-looking corporate legal services capable of guiding a course of action for the company in question.\nAt our law firm, we are well versed in civil substantive law and the Code of Civil Procedure and endeavor to settle disputes swiftly and appropriately. With lawsuits we develop sophisticated legal arguments based on \"The Requisite Facts Theory\u201d of the Legal Training and Research Institute of Japan and prepare carefully for witness examinations. We are proud of our track record with numerous cases over many years in the area of civil provisional remedies and civil execution, and we have also at times proactively made submissions with respect to court practices. Our advantage of developing appropriate outlooks on the outcome of legal procedures is useful in pre-trial negotiations and ADR (with alternative dispute resolution organizations).\nWe also provide legal services regarding the various types of regulations pertaining to the Personal Information Protection Act and the Act Regarding Use, etc. of Numbers for Identification of Specific Individual in Administrative Procedure (so-called the My Number Act).

Our firm maintains this fundamental awareness whilst also on the other hand providing legal services and practice in risk management in keeping with the detailed regulatory codes.\nIn the area of corporate rehabilitation and bankruptcy law, expertise is now also required not only in conventional applicant's representative and receiver related legal work, but also in M&A related legal work and the associated financial legal work.

In addition to traditional legal services such as consultation work regarding legal issues unique to public organizations and statutory interpretation, and drafting various regulations and contracts, our firm recently has been increasingly providing advice on Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs) that employ a variety of mechanisms and schemes, such as projects utilizing public real estate, comprehensive outsourcing to the private sector, and the Designated Manager System, etc.\nWe provide a broad range of legal services such as building schemes, drafting contracts and corresponding to regulation, etc. in many cases involving general real estate transactions, securitization of real estate and real estate funds, etc.\nWe ensure we grasp an understanding of new and revised laws, mainly in the area of laws and regulations in the finance sector, in a timely manner and work with a variety of industry organizations and research panels regarding how to deal with them. We also cooperate with the building of legal systems as well as on the other hand submit opinions to avoid over-regulation, and proactively engage in policy-related legal work pertaining to lawmaking.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T03:14:17Z", "url": "https://klo.gr.jp/en/practices", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Self Image \u2013 The idea one has of one\u2019s abilities, appearance, and personality.\nMaintaining a positive self-image can be really difficult. I know, personally, I have always struggled with this. I say \u201cself-image\u201d instead of \u201cbody image\u201d because I believe it\u2019s important to love all of yourself. Your style, your taste, your views, your abilities, your personality. There is a word that I feel has maybe fallen on the back burner these days and that word is INDIVIDUAL. You are you, and there is not a single person out there who is exactly like you. That is something to celebrate, not something to shy away from.\nHave you ever let someone else influence how you feel about yourself or how you act?\nFor example, maybe you use to love Japanese food, but now, since your partner hates it, you haven\u2019t actually had Japanese food in a very long time. Or maybe you use to love the color red, but someone once said \u201cRed is so not your color\u201d and now every time you go to put on something red, that voice is in your head and you end up changing your mind\u2026 Now imagine if we let everyone else dictate everything about us. We would all be an absolute mess. It is important for you to really know yourself. Know what you like and dislike and stick to it. This saying is one that I keep in mind and try to live by.\nKnow what you stand for or you will fall for anything.\nI can\u2019t stress how important it is for us to love ourselves and see value in what we have to offer. If we don\u2019t, then how can we expect anyone else to?\nI believe social media certainly plays a role in our mental view of ourselves. How we dress, decorate our home, exercise\u2026 social media can even influence something as simple as how we feel about our cleaning routine. I know this first hand because I have allowed other people on social media to make me feel small or inadequate before. Maybe because they have a perfectly organized kitchen or they vacuum their carpet every day and I don\u2019t.\nLet me repeat \u2013 I ALLOW myself feel to small or inadequate. These other people do not in any way TRY to make me feel this way.\nMaybe I don\u2019t dust my blinds, or wipe down my fridge every single day \u2013 Does that make me a bad mom or wife? NO it doesn\u2019t. Another example from my personal experience is when some moms on social media look so \u201cput together\u201d and flawless in every Instagram photo, whereas I\u2019m almost always wearing leggings and t-shirts that usually have the ever-so-glam spit-up stains on them. And let\u2019s not forget the mom bun hairstyle that seems to be an every day occurrence. Maybe it\u2019s just me, in this phase of life I\u2019m in, but I have definitely allowed the perfect realm of social media to affect how I feel about myself and how I take care of my little family.\nGirl, you have to pick yourself up out of the slump that is comparing yourself to others.\nYou have your own taste, your own style, your own way of doing things. I wonder, if you spent an entire week off of the socials, how would that make you feel? What would change? Like seriously\u2026 would you dress the way you wanted, would you play with your make-up and maybe find a new look that you like? Would you cook or bake something you haven\u2019t had in a while simply because you want to? Would you sit down and read a book? Would you start to fall in love with YOU again?\nTo kind of wrap all of this up, let me leave you with this.\nHaving a positive self image is one of the absolute best things that you can do for yourself. I urge you, if you don\u2019t already, get to know yourself. Who are you deep down in your core? Without influences, without outside voices, WHO ARE YOU? Once you know the answer to this, ask yourself.\nIf you don\u2019t like who you are, what do you need to change in order to like yourself a bit more? Now, GO DO IT.\nBe more thrifty, give to charity, de-clutter your home, REALLY dance like no one\u2019s watching to your favorite song, whatever it takes.\nThank you all for your wonderful comments and for reading my post!\nWriting this post was a process and I\u2019m happy to have discussed a topic you all seem to have enjoyed.

{"text": "Unlike many of his peers, Crane is quick to let down his hair [not literally, of course].\nYou might know Ben Crane best from his YouTube videos, in which he speeds up his pace of play by donning Rollerblades and being towed by a golf cart; raps about barely qualifying for the FedEx Cup playoffs (\"I'm a bubble boy/buh-buh-bubble boy\"); and shares his mental-game secrets, Golf in the Kingdom\u2013style (\"I experience zone. I'm speaking to you from the now, in the middle of the now.\") Crane also croons with his fellow Golf Boys bandmates Rickie Fowler, Hunter Mahan and Bubba Watson (with lyrics by Mat Kearney, the singer-songwriter who, like Crane, hails from Oregon). But the 37-year-old funnyman also has an intense side. You've heard of the 10,000 hours it takes to master a pursuit? Crane has logged 35,000 hours honing his game. (He counted.) If you think that's odd, consider that Crane believes he's no more innately talented at golf than you are. The main reason he chose this career path was because as a kid he could beat his five buddies. The Tour's biggest ham talks about the 100 percent commitment required to excel at both golf and comedy, his infamously slow pace of play, and why he won't let the bad back that knocked him out of the 2013 FedEx Cup playoffs diminish his enthusiasm -- or his sense of humor.\nIn the media center after you won the 2010 Farmers Insurance Open, you broke into an impersonation of your southern-fried, former-college-football-coach agent Tommy Limbaugh. It got quite a laugh, even among the cynical press. Was that when you realized you could bring your act to a wider audience?\nIt's been a slow progression, no pun intended, where things have just worked. The more you show your personality, the more fun everyone else has. I'm watching tennis last night, I'm watching Rafael Nadal play a guy, and it was 6-0 in the first set, and in the second set the guy is just trying to score a point. He finally thought he scored one; they did the shot-spot thing, and it was out by an inch. It was the moment where he should have gone, like, What do I gotta do to score a point against this Nadal guy? But he didn't. Athletes get so stuck in competition sometimes that we just can't let go of it.\nHas your game improved since you've been expressing this lighter side?\nWell, 2010 and 2005 were my best years, but it's been a battle with my body. I have a lot more potential now, and I have a bigger team around me. Instead of no one following me, now I'll have friends who are following me, and sometimes they'll walk up to a random person and say, \"Who are you following?\" In a few cases the person has said, \"Ben Crane. He's my favorite player.\" And my friend will go, \"Why?\" And the kid will say, \"You don't know? You don't know about the videos?\" [Laughs] That is so fun right there.\nYour fans definitely get your sense of humor. When your caddie decided to take a day off on a Wednesday, and you told people to apply on Twitter for the one-day job to replace him, you got interesting responses, like, \"I have a rough tongue like a cat and can clean the grooves of a wedge in seconds. My tics are mostly silent.\"\n[Laughs] That deserves to be written somewhere in this magazine! That is so good. We've opened up the job twice, actually. We did it at the Byron Nelson and at the Travelers. For the Nelson, we found a guy who had played in college. It was his birthday. And for the Travelers, we did it for a cause called Charity: Water, and the guy bid a couple of thousand bucks. He was awesome. We really hit it off.\nDo you think most Tour pros could stand to loosen up?\nI don't think, I know. I mean, I'm very serious between the ropes at times, especially when it's not going well. I can feel like I can't let myself have a good time. But guys need to pick their chin up a little bit and look around. Dude, you're on the PGA Tour! You've probably dreamed about this since you were a kid. It's so fun. I don't care if you just made double; you have the opportunity to look at a kid and throw him a ball and make his day. I try to remember that.\nYou show full comedic commitment in your spoof videos, which you have to do to make them work. Your wardrobe gets laughs, too. Where did the helmet come from? In the video where you offer exercise tips, it's a crucial prop, along with the unitard.\nMy buddy went to Goodwill and found it. I was like, \"What is this thing?\" It's a low-end ski helmet. I never picked up on that until the fifth video. That whole outfit is like five bucks at Good-will. It's awful. It's so tight. It doesn't breathe. It would be great in the Oregon fall, for surfing.\nWho are your favorite comedians? Have you seen Borat?\nI have not seen Borat. Honestly, the stuff that Joel [Stock], my caddie, and I have seen -- he has a great sense of humor and a great memory for funny lines -- would be \"Coming to America,\" \"Spies Like Us,\" \"Caddyshack\" and \"Dumb and Dumber.\"\nRight. Kind of like \"Life of Pi.\" At the end you go, \"Ah, now it makes sense.\"\nUnfortunately, \"Planes.\" It was a big letdown. \"Shrek\" was amazing. \"Cars\" was amazing. \"Planes\" was not. And \"Finding Nemo\" was great.\nYou have three kids, so it's obvious who's picking the movies. What TV shows do you watch?\nYou know, I'm trying to think if I've turned on the TV this year for something other than sports. I watched the Bible documentary. When you have three kids under 6, you have to ask, am I going to space out on the couch for an hour and a half, or am I going to hang out with my kids? When your kids are grown up and out of the house, everyone says, \"It happened so fast. I wish they were back.\"\nMusician Mat Kearney helped with the lyrics on Golf Boys 2.0 and the Bubble Boy video, which poked fun at you for being 125th on the money list at the Barclays. Which video took the longest to make?\nGolf Boys 2.0 was six weeks of talking to the production crew and doing some of the writing with Kearney, and giving feedback and stuff. The shoot only took two days, but afterward, editing and stuff, it was a couple of months. We shot it at Vaquero here in Dallas.\nDid everyone stay at your house?\nThey did, except for Hunter, who lives here. Bubba bought my daughter her first Elmo. He's awesome with kids. And Rickie was on the floor rolling around with them. It was funny; we were driving to the course and one of Kearney's songs came on the radio. I was sitting there thinking, What do you do when you're sitting right next to a guy whose song is on the radio? Do you sing along?\nDo you ever play money games with Ryan Palmer or Todd Hamilton or any of the other pros who live and play at Vaquero?\nI should, but it's really just practice. I like playing in the Phil money game, the Mickelson game on Tuesdays. It's competitive. I've played in that a few times, and you're so ready to play in the tournament after that.\nMickelson loves to get in guys' ears. Give us your best Phil smack-talking story.\nA few months back, Phil and I were playing a match in an off-week, and we were on the 10th green, both about eight feet away for birdie. He said, \"I found the secret to putting.\" And I said, \"Really?\" Well, I make my putt and he misses, and because he's always jabbing me, I say, \"Looks like I had the secret to putting on that one.\" He thinks about it for about 10 seconds and says, \"Yeah, but I had the secret to putting at the British Open.\" [Laughs] Yes, he did.\nYou rapped with Bubba Watson on the 16th tee during the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Were you more nervous for that or the golf?\nI was going to do it anyway. I had the helmet in the bag and everything. And then Bubba and I got paired together. I mean, are you kidding me? It was perfect. And there's a guy who stands up there and says, \"Hey, crowd, be quiet,\" and so we went over and grabbed his microphone. But, yeah, I was nervous.\nRory Sabbatini famously left you in the dust at the 2005 Booz Allen at Congressional. Have you gotten much faster with your pace of play since then?\nRory and I are friends, and I've tried to get better. Last year I talked to Jon Brendle, a Tour official, and they see everything. I said, \"Hey, how am I doing?\" His reaction was very positive. He said, \"Just keep up with the group in front of you.\" I don't want guys to get bummed out when they get paired with me. I didn't even know in high school and college golf that I was slow. No one ever said anything.\nYou beat Rory Mcllroy 8 and 7 in the WGC-Accenture Match Play in 2011, and later that year you made eight birdies in the last 11 holes to force a playoff with Webb Simpson in the McGladrey Classic, which you then won. Were you hotter when you thumped Rory or when you beat Webb?\nWhen I made those eight birdies, I got so hot with the putter. Webb told me he went back and watched the broadcast, like, six months later. He said, \"I got so mad. They were going in from across the green!\" With Rory, I was playing some of the best golf of my life, but my back went out the next morning on the range.\nYou finished the year 139th in driving distance. Was that because of your back?\nMy clubhead speed on the Nation-wide Tour was about 124 miles an hour. If I saw the front lip of a bunker 300 yards out, I wouldn't even think about it -- I'd just fly it. I was so long. I was No. 1 in driving distance for the first five months of the season out there, but then I got injured and stopped working on being fast, and now I'm way down in driving distance. [Laughs] I can't smoke it anymore.\nDid that inspire you to become a better short-game player?\nIt contributed to it. Plus, when you're not feeling well you can at least work on your chipping and putting, which I did. I would swing on a launch monitor and think about how I could get faster. I went from 115 mph to 124 mph in about a year.\nYou've worked with short-game coach James Sieckmann for a few years. How much of your short-game prowess do you owe to him? Why do you two click?\nI was having some trouble with my chipping and pitching, with my contact, especially on Bermuda grass with tight lies. I was like, \"I'm missing something.\" I spoke to Tom Pernice, who said, \"You should go see my guy.\" I said, \"You've got a guy?\" It's been dynamite. I think I'm top 10 in bunker play. He really understands the mental game, too.\nHave you also seen improvement in your wedge play?\nI'm much more confident with that 50-yard shot, the 60-yard shot, just because he's taught me proper technique and how to practice for that shot. The difference between the best player in the world and the guy who finishes 100th on the money list is not much -- maybe one shot a round.\nIt's a fine line out there. \"It's a fine line between clever and stupid.\" Do you know what that's from?\n\"This Is Spinal Tap.\" Have you seen that film?\nYou have to see \"Spinal Tap\"! For a comedy lover, it's an absolute must.\nOkay, it's on my list. I'll write it down.\nYou used to not look at the Tour pairings to see who you were playing with the next day, in case it was someone you grew up idolizing. Do you still not look?\nI still don't look. The Tour sends you your tee time for the next day, but it goes to my caddie's phone, it goes to my wife's phone, but not to my phone. Some guys will spoil the surprise and say, \"Looks like it's you and me tomorrow.\"\nYou learned the game at the age of 5 from your grandfather, right?\nYeah, my grandpa was like my best friend, and if I wanted to hang out with him we were going to play golf. The cool thing was, he had three old guys he played with, and one of his cronies died when I was 8 or 10, so I took his spot. We gambled a lot. We played a dime a hole, and double or nothing on 18, so it was big money. That was when I learned to love the game. That was at Portland Golf Club, which we live a block away from in the summer.\nAre you a member there?\nYeah, they gave me an honorary membership. They have a plaque saying that that's where I learned to play. There's a lot of history there. They had a Ryder Cup in . Hogan played there, and a lot of the greats, so they're like, \"Do you want us to put your plaque up?\" [Laughs] I'm like, \"No, no, in the ground is fine.\" So they put it in the ground next to the putting green.\nYou're a big tennis fan. What else did you play as a kid?\nI'd seen my dad going to work every day [he owned a small media-development firm] and I thought, That looks terrible. I've got to figure out professional sports. I played basketball until 10th grade, but I was vertically challenged and maybe the fourth-best player on my team. Soccer, I was the third-best guy on my team. Baseball, I'm kind of afraid of the ball. Golf, well, I was the best golfer of my five friends, so I decided to go for it. I quit everything else, practiced every day as hard as I could. The pro I worked with growing up used to say, \"I think if I worked a little harder I could've made it.\" I thought, I'll never say that.\nSo you got your 10,000 hours in.\nThirty-five thousand -- I added 'em up.\nSo you should be really good by now, given you've put in more than three times as much as the 10,000 hours that Malcolm Gladwell recommends in his book \"Outliers.\"\nI read \"Bounce\" [by Matthew Syed] and \"Talent is Overrated\" [by Geoff Colvin]. I think Bounce is the best one. He proved that guys like Mozart, Roger Federer -- it has nothing to do with genes; it's about putting in specific, intense hours of practice. Of course, you can't play post for the Houston Rockets if you're my size.\nSo you don't think you have any more innate ability at golf than a bogey golfer?\nNo. I think we all have unique gifts, but just about anyone can train to be just about anything.\nWell, that's both encouraging and discouraging. Four victories on Tour, two Web.com wins -- are you done? You're 37, and you've got a bad back. Is this it?\nNo. I'm planning to do the Steve Stricker thing. I'm planning to go to 47, and I'm planning to have the best decade of my career from 37 to 47. I am so confident that my best golf is in front of me -- and this is the shooter's mentality in basketball -- that I'm thinking of putting money down on myself in Vegas.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-25T14:57:55Z", "url": "https://www.golf.com/tour-and-news/pga-tours-ben-crane-why-pros-need-lighten-and-why-his-best-golf-may-be-ahead-him", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "Today I have a post for you on making lovely homemade bubble wands.\nWe used the new and improved Artterro bubble wand kit, sent to us for review (and which also contains materials and instructions for making some fun garden art!), but if you\u2019re feeling crafty and resourceful you could make bubble wands without a kit.\nIf you\u2019re a craft store junkie (who, me?) with more time than money or just like working things out, then go the DIY route.\nBut even hard-core DIYers like me enjoy a good kit now and again.\nThe Artterro Eco Art Kits are my kind of art kit.\nThey contain beautiful, high quality materials, are accompanied by inspirational idea-filled brochures, and are made and packaged with the Earth in mind. But the real kicker for me is that while they are KITS, they are still wonderfully open-ended. There is no right or wrong way to create bubble wands or garden art or any other art or craft in the Artterro kits (and we\u2019ve tried just about all of their art kits at this point).\nWe were excited to try out Artterro\u2019s bubble wand kit, partly because who doesn\u2019t love a bubble wand?\nAnd an even more sustainable focus.\nAmong other changes, the packaging is now made from 100% recycled cardboard.\nMaia, Daphne, and I got to work on making bubble wands with the kit.\nEach kit has two painted wooden dowels so can officially be used to make 2 bubble wands. However, if you have a few sticks or dowels around, you could easily make several more with the amount of wire and glass beads included.\nMaia and I poked wire through the holes at the tops of the wooden dowels, bent it into our desired bubble wand shapes, then looped it back down and wrapped it around the dowels to secure it.\nMaia made a simple heart-shaped bubble wand (above).\nDaphne and I collaborated to make a flower-shaped bubble wand.\nThe bubble wand kit says it\u2019s for ages 8 and up, but Daphne, at 4, was able to participate at her own level.\nI did the wire bending and cutting on our wand and she did the bead stringing (one of her favorite activities).\nHere\u2019s our finished flower bubble wand.\nThe kit doubles as a garden art kit, with thicker wire and bigger beads and marbles for the garden art.\nBut then decided they were too awesome as silly dress up glasses.\nSo she created a spiral for the garden instead. The beads are meant to be attached by wrapping the thinner wire around them, but Maia had a bit of trouble with that, and decided to use scotch tape instead.\nHave you made homemade bubble wands? Or garden art?\nP.S. Tomorrow I\u2019ll share photos from our afternoon of bubble blowing with our new homemade bubble wands!\nIf you\u2019d like to try out this or other art kits, check out the new and improved arts and crafts kits in the Artterro shop or read on for an Artterro art kit giveaway.\nTo enter the giveaway for a chance to win both Artterro\u2019s Deluxe Bubble Wand Kit as well as their Needle Felting Kit, leave a comment to this post by Friday, April 25th at 11:59 pm EST. After you leave your comment, make sure to tell the Rafflecopter widget that you commented and would like to enter the giveaway! Giveaway open to readers in the US.\nThis Artterro Eco Art Kit was sent to us for free to try out and review, by Artterro, an Artful Parent sponsor. All opinions expressed are my own.\nI love Artterro kits, and the idea of a bubble wand-making kit is too fabulous.\nMy kiddos are obsessed with bubbles and would be over the moon if we made our own bubble wands!\nI have been making bubble wands since I was a little girl I make my own glass beads also. I use vynal covered close line wire .it comes in different shiney colors . Have lots of fun sell lots .I put up a tea cart a bowl of water or bucket on the ground.

{"text": "It goes without saying that you want all of the visitors in your home to be ones that were invited in \u2014 and that includes animals. But when your chimney\u2019s flue isn\u2019t topped with a chimney cap, animals of various kinds will take that as an open invitation to move into your chimney and into your home. And since your chimney isn\u2019t the only vent open to the outdoors, it\u2019s not your only animal concern \u2014 your dryer vent can allow animals to make their way in as well.\nThe most efficient way to prevent animal intruders is to have a chimney cap or animal guard installed by Blue Sky Chimney Sweeps.\nBirds, squirrels, raccoons, bats and even snakes have been known to enter homes through a chimney that doesn\u2019t have a chimney cap or an animal guard protecting it. It makes sense: Your chimney is a tall structure that can offer protection to nesting animals. Unfortunately, although adult birds and animals can often leave your chimney as easily as they came into it, their babies aren\u2019t as capable. If they can\u2019t exit by climbing up, their natural reaction is to try and get down, which brings them into your home, causing considerable damage along the way as they frantically try to escape. If they don\u2019t make it out of your chimney at all, they\u2019ll likely die, causing an array of other problems, including odors and maggot infestations.\nWild animals that come into your home bring annoying noises and unwanted smells, but they routinely bring along bigger concerns, too. They bring highly-flammable nesting materials that block your flue; fleas, lice and other insects; and rabies and other diseases that can put you and your family at risk. Raccoons, in particular, are known for being vicious, and can make their way into your home through your fireplace opening.\nRemoving animals isn\u2019t easy, and with certain animals, it can be particularly complicated. Chimney swifts are federally-protected birds that love to nest in chimneys, and they cannot be forcibly removed. Bats are another protected species. If these animals make their way into your chimney, you\u2019ll have to wait for them to leave on their own. Call Blue Sky Chimney Sweeps if you find that birds or bats are living in your chimney \u2014 after they\u2019ve left, we can clean everything out, check for damages and install a chimney cap to keep you from having problems in the future.\nIf you\u2019ve heard animal noises in your chimney, make sure the chimney is swept and inspected before you use it, and have Blue Sky Chimney Sweeps install a chimney cap to protect your system going forward.\nKeeping animals out is an important part of the chimney cap\u2019s role in your chimney system, but it\u2019s not the only assistance it provides. Chimney caps also work to keep rain and snow from getting into your open flue, and certain chimney caps can even provide other forms of protection and augmentation.\nQuality chimney caps include a mesh screen that works to keep sparks from igniting nearby trees, leaves and brush. Windy weather can cause chimney drafting problems that inhibit your chimney\u2019s proper function and contribute to dispersion of those sparks. Draft-inducing chimney caps can often help correct drafting issues, and in the process, minimize spark problems (Enervex exhaust fans are also great fixes for draft issues). Chimney caps with spark arrestors are essential for homes on wooded properties.\nTake preventative action and \u201cBless Your Hearth\u201d by having Blue Sky Chimney Sweeps install a functional and beautiful chimney cap and animal guard atop your system. Call us or make your appointment online, today!\nThe installation of the right chase cover can add years of life to your prefabricated chimney system.

{"text": "Which got me thinking about other things that have been forced down our throats by the zeitgeist, people, places, and trends that the pop culture puppeteers insist on making relevant. Here are ten items I could truly do without. If you know me, I'm not usually about spreading the hateration, but sometimes we all need a good vent.\n1. Julianne Hough - Thankfully I never saw that Footloose remake. However, I did catch this summer's Rock of Ages, and while I was entertained, this 24-year-old bobblehead came close to spoiling the whole musical enchilada for me. And she's still dating Seacrest? And getting more movie roles? Why, Hollywood, why?\n2. Fifty Shades of Grey - I picked up a copy at the L.A. Times Festival of Books back in April, read one page, and then felt the urge to bring it with me into a bathroom stall after eating a dozen shrimp tacos. The latest literary sensation will eventually become the next movie franchise sensation. Wake me up when it's over.\n3. Ke$ha - The second full-length album from this glitter tramp is scheduled to arrive before the year is over. In related news, I think I just contracted herpes from writing that last sentence.\n4. Adam Sandler - I did not need to see Jack & Jill or That's My Boy to realize that the King of Fart Jokes (and his entire production company) is running on fumes. It would be great if he went into hiding and then returned 20 years later to do a respectable cameo in a Tarantino flick.\n5. Big-budget comic book adaptations - The Avengers should have been the grand finale that hammered the final nail in the genre's coffin. It was one giant, wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am way to lasso up all of our favorite superheroes and send them off in a spectacular farewell. But no, we're getting Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Ant-Man, Iron Man 3, and another Wolverine.\n6. Charlie Sheen - This gimmick is deader than the silent graveyard otherwise known as my love life.\n7. Anything labeled with the Kardashian name - Speaks for itself.\n8. American Idol - Usually, when people are jumping overboard, that means the ship is sinking. This voyage plummeted to the bottom of the ocean a while ago and is now a piece of driftwood floating aimlessly in a pool of muck. How many more interchangeable \"white guys with guitars\" do we need to crown before every light on the stage burns out? Mariah Carey, prepare that life vest.\n9. Movies based on the novels of Nicholas Sparks - Or, what I like to call The Notebook Effect. Forever fooling singletons into thinking they'll meet the love of their life during a war, in a car accident, on a beach, or in a torrential rainstorm. I think I liked these better when they were called Lifetime Movies of the Week.\n10. Kristen Stewart - I'm sure she's a cool chick once you get to know her, but 1.) she ain't fairer than Charlize Theron 2.) I worry that future generations of impressionable actresses will be studying her two methods of \"acting\" which are: Look Like You're Constipated and Look Like You Got Cramps and 3.) the girl needs to enroll in a few classes on public speaking.\nI'll stop there. And to those responsible for the above, I hope you will too.\nAmen to #10. Frankly they're all right on the $$$. With all the forcefeeding happening all the time, this list could easily go on a bit further ~ maybe there will be a sequel?\nI COMPLETELY agree with them all (esp Kristen Stewart, as there are already actresses mimicking her and getting big roles!), except the comic book movies. I can't help it, I love them!", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-18T11:08:15Z", "url": "http://www.thefirstecho.com/2012/08/10-things-pop-culture-should-stop.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
