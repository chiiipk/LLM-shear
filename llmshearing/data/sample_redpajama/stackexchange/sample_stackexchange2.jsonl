Thanks!\n\nA: I think the simplest way of doing it is : \nsudo killall -9 -u wifes_name \n\nA: Using the Terminal, you can kill her loginwindow process and any programs she has open will be closed... but this will cause her to lose any unsaved work she has! In fact, this is the very reason you need to log in as her to log out: When you log in as her, all her programs again have access to the GUI, so they can prompt you to confirm closure, save changes or take other action before logging out.\nIf you're sure that she only has things like a web browser, iTunes, etc open, not Pages, Word, Photoshop, or anything else with documents, then you could try from the terminal:\nkill `ps awwwwux | grep her_short_username | grep loginwindow | grep -v grep | awk \"{ print \\$2 }\"`\n\nOn OSX 10.10.4: (slight edit from last comment): \nexport pn=`ps awwwwux | awk '/her_short_username/ && /loginwind[o]w/ { print $2 }'`\nsudo kill -9 $pn\n\n\nA: You can use the Activity Monitor to log another user out by killing their login process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Activity Monitor\n\n*In the filter at the top-right, type loginwindow\n\n*Click the row with the user's name in the User column\n\n*Click Quit Process, then Force Quit, and type your password.\n\n\nThis is just a nicer(?)

Not to mention it is saved somewhere on my harddrive that I can easily read without the application running, and backup).\n\n*If the text gets long, a scrollbar appears. You can choose how much screen estate to use for your Stickies.\n\n*You can easily set the title of the Stickies.\n\n*You can manage the Stickies, hide ones you don't want to see now, and bring them back later. So in effect it also works as a small notes database, but it is primarily a great scratchpad.\n\n*Being able to hide a Stickies is great because sometimes you may want to keep a Stickies visible while working on something, and you might want to hide others which get in the way.\n\n*Stickies had awesome shortcuts like: bring back all \"hidden\" stickies in view.\n\n*They were not as pretty as OS X Stickies, but you could set transparency and colours freely.\n\n\nIn general I find Mac apps to be superior in usability and looks, but this is one type of app where nearly every attempt I've seen on OS X veers towards \"personal wiki\" (too much), or online synching (don't need), or just plain clunky (dashboard widget).\nI used Stickies on Windows for YEARS. I would totally pay 20 \u20ac or more for that on OS X.\n\nA: I know this is old but Ill add one that I just found in case people are still looking at this. It's called WikityWidgets I have yet to use it because I just downloaded it but does look like it will be pretty good.\n\nA: I'm using SimpleNote on my Mac and iPhone for pretty much all my note-taking. It automatically syncs notes between computers/devices, so might not be for you if you only want local notes. I find it's really convenient for accessing my notes everywhere, though.\nIt doesn't look like big sticky notes, instead you get a list view of your notes with a preview, from which you can open the entire note. I find it really pretty, but it might not be the aestethic you're after.\nEdit: Forgot to mention that I use the DashNote widget on my Macs. There are other options as well, but they mainly come as stand-alone programs.\n\nA: http://junecloud.com/software/dashboard/notefile.html\nJust what you asked for. Its much better than the default stickies.\n\nA: I use Tomboy notes.  It's similar to stickies, but with some nice extra features.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Link notes together simply by typing a previous notes title in your current note\n\n*Recently accessed notes are quickly accessible\n\n*You can 'pin' notes so that they are always quickly accessible\n\n*Create multiple notebooks\n\n\nSearching notes and linking related notes together is really easy.  The only feature I think it's lacking is a way to sync with my iPhone.\n\nA: Check out Secret NotePad. It looks like you can resize it, lock it, and apply various styles to it. It also looks pretty nice.\n\nA: Don't use stickies, especially the widget ones that come with the computer because if you click the checkmark box they disapear and you loose all your information. Unless there is  a majic way of recovering the data. \n\nA: Simple Antnotes (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simple-antnotes/id846599902?mt=12) is a good one.\nPros:\n1. A nice interface with a widget.

{"text": "Q: Can I use multiple gmail-based accounts with the same username (but different domains) with Mail.app & IMAP? A recent mail file corruption has led me to finally putting Eudora to bed.  Since my personal email has been backed by gmail for a few years, and my work email is a Google apps email account, I figured I'd take advantage of server-based storage to not worry about fixing Eudora mail files, but just use IMAP to sync up with the servers in Apple mail and be done with it.\nWell, my personal account and my company account are both the same user name, i.e. username123@gmail.com, and username123@company.com.  (Not real.)  And it seems like this is causing a collision in Mail.app.  On editing the initial mail config setup, I get an error:  \"Invalid Directory:  The account path /Users/.../Library/Mail/IMAP-username123@imap.gmail.com is already being used by the account Company Mail\".  \nI was concerned by this, but it did seem to be busily downloading mail into the \"All Mail\" folder for the new account, so I let it run.  But, yeah, it seems broken.  What should be individual inbox folders for each account show all the same sets of messages.  That's no good.\nA funny thing is that I've had these same two accounts on my iPhone, with IMAP, and it keeps them straight!\nSo, am I doomed to not being able to use Apple Mail in this scenario?\nUpdate: Today, the two inboxes look separate, after a restart of Mail overnight.  However, I still get the same error when I try to change the personal account to send through an alternate server, so I think there is still a problem here.\n\nA: Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mail and delete each of the conflicting accounts. Close Mail.\n\n*Go to ~/Library/Mail/ and make sure any IMAP-username123@imap.gmail.com folder has been deleted. If there is any such folder left, delete it now.\n\n*Open Mail and create one of the accounts and let Mail load your messages. Close Mail.\n\n*Go to ~/Library/Mail/ and verify that a folder called IMAP-username123@imap.gmail.com has been created.\n\n*Open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist. If you have installed Xcode, this file will open with Property List Editor. Otherwise you can download a free trial of PlistEdit Pro to open this file. Using a plain text editor with .plist files is more difficult.\n\n*With the .plist file open, click the disclosure triangle for MailAccounts. Here you will find Item 0, Item 1, etc.\n\n*If you click the disclosure triangle for each of the Item headings, you will find that one of them has the value username123@gmail.com or username123@company.com for the AccountName key, depending on which account you created in step 3.\n\n*Change the value for AccountPath for this Item so that the path will not collide with that of the next account you are to create.\n\n*Save and close the .plist file.\n\n*Open Mail and let it reload your messages. Close Mail.\n\n*Go to ~/Library/Mail/ and verify that a folder with the path value you provided in step 8 has been created. Delete the old folder called IMAP-username123@imap.gmail.com.\n\n*Open Mail and create the remaining account normally and let Mail load your messages.\n\n\nA: You could try setting one up as POP but leave the messages on the server, and the other as IMAP.\n\nA: I have seven Gmail accounts set up on Apple Mail via IMAP, running OS X Mountain Lion.

{"text": "Q: Exporting iTunes smart playlist definitions I have 30 or so smart playlists defined in iTunes on the PC. What I'd like to do is export all of these definitions. To clarify, I don't want to export the songs in each of these playlists, I want to export the definition (e.g. \"Artist contains Foo\").\nI have a lot of conditions defined for each playlist, and would prefer a solution that doesn't involve manually performing the same steps 30 times. For example, if I could export registry settings, this would be the best solution.\n\nA: If you select a smart playlist, then choose File > Library > Export Playlist... and choose the XML file format, you can then use the corresponding Import Playlist... command from another iTunes library to import the smart playlist definition. \nUnfortunately, iTunes only lets you select one playlist at a time, so there's no way to select multiple playlists and export them at the same time. You can do the \"Export Library...\" which does everything, but then you have all sorts of extra stuff you don't want. \nIf you're comfortable hacking around a bit though, you could export the whole library, then use PlistEdit Pro to edit the file and remove all the playlist and track dictionaries that you don't want, leaving just your smart playlists. Then you'd have all the playlist definitions in a single file that you can import into another iTunes library.\n\nA: After rebuilding my SmartLists for the seemingly 100th time, I had to find a better way.  I came up with a solution, but it takes some pre-planning - you have to export your lists as XML before you lose them.  I then remove all song references from the XML file so the file only contains the SmartList parameters.  Then when I need to restore the list (like after an update/upgrade), I simply import the XML file.  Here are the instructions to save copies of your lists:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on your SmartList and choose Export, then be sure to select XML as Save As Filetype.\n\n*Open the .XML file with a text editor and search for <key>Playlists</key>. Set the cursor at the beginning of that line, then use your slide-bar to scroll all the way to the top.  Select all lines from where you started up to the line that has <key>Tracks</key> , then delete those lines. (Deletes the <dict></dict> section under Tracks.)\n\n*Look for the line with <key>Playlist Items</key> .  Skip the next line ( </dict> ), then click at the beginning of the next line.  Scroll to the bottom of the file, then select all lines down to the third line from the bottom ( </array> ).  Remove those lines. (Deletes the Playlist Items <array>)\n\n\nDoing this reduces the XML file size (2k to 3k depending on the complexity of your list), and stores only the parameters of your SmartList, not the actual songs list.  Importing these XML files will rebuild your song list, and this hasn't failed me yet. Remember to include these files with your backups so that you can recover these lists if your hard drive fails.  Also remember to repeat the process if you ever change the parameters of your SmartList.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3537", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}

{"text": "Q: Why does my iPhone 4 get so hot during charging? My iPhone 4 gets hot as the battery is charged. To compound the issue, I think I bought a cheap case that traps heat, which in turn makes the phone even hotter -- you can feel the heat if you hold it in your hand while it is charging. When you stop charging it, the excess heat goes away.\nMy question is: does this damage the hardware? Also, to reduce the heat, I put the phone on the floor (which is cooler) and I found that the device was not as hot as before (previously I had put the phone to charge on a wooden table). I am unsure as to whether my measure helps in elongating the battery life and protecting the electronic components.\n\nA: FYI, iPhone 4 does have heat sensors and if it gets dangerously hot it will show a black screen with a yellow warning sign and shut down. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned and take the measures you have to increase heat dissipation, but batteries warming on charging is quite normal. I wouldn't worry unless the iPhone displays an overheating warning consistently.\n\nA: The charging process heats the device (phone/laptop/or any other battery), make sure that it\u2019s relatively acceptable. If in doubt take it to an Apple Store together with your charger to compare with others. If you live in a very hot place, it might be safer to help dissipate heat by using the floor or any other metal surface. \nIf it gets too hot, the battery will not be happy and will \u201clast less\u201d. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3545", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

Occasionally after rebooting the machine, the disk numbering changes such that the /dev/disk# does not reference the same drive as it did before the reboot.\nExample\n/dev/disk0 -> 64GB SSD drive\n/dev/disk1 -> 640GB Hitachi\n/dev/disk2 -> 160GB WD (BootCamp)\n\nAfter rebooting the mapping might be\n/dev/disk0 -> 160GB WD (BootCamp)\n/dev/disk1 -> 640GB Hitachi\n/dev/disk2 -> 64GB SSD drive\n\nEven more confusing is that the remapping is not consistent. For most stuff this is irrelevant. However I also have Parallels installed to allow access to the BootCamp partition from within OSX. Parallels uses the /dev/disk# path in it's configuration file so, after rebooting OSX I launch Parallels and it tells me that the disk is no longer present.\nIs there a way to tell OSX to always assign a given drive to /dev/disk0?\n\nA: There does not seem to be a way to specify a device for a given drive. Your best bet might be to not auto-mount, then use a LaunchAgent to mount them in the order you want with a pause between each mount, and see if it works that way. This method might get messed up if you have a USB key or something else that auto-mounts available to the system when you boot.\n\nA: One trick I've used to solve your Parallels use case is to have the config file point to a symbolic link file, and then update the symlink to point to the correct device before starting the vm.\nIf you're comfortable writing scripts, you could use a shell script like this to determine the device name and update the symlink based on the volume name:\n BOOTCAMP_DEVICE=`mount | grep BOOTCAMP | cut -f 1 -d ' '`\n ln -f -s $BOOTCAMP_DEVICE path_to_symlink\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3561", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: Keys not registering on the iPhone while typing fast, does it happen to you or just me? I've tried this on all major OS versions of the iPhone, and on an iPhone 3G and 4. It's been around for at least a year.\nI've noticed that when I'm typing really fast (over 70 wpm) on a portrait keyboard, sometimes a key will not register as being touched. I think what's happening behind the scenes is that the fingers are moving so fast that it thinks that it's the same finger that moved from one side of the keyboard to the other in a dragging motion. (Normally when you drag a key, it won't send the first key you were on and will only send the last key you released on.)\nThis only happens when you are typing a word where the letters alternate between the left and right fingers such that both are touching the screen at the same time. One word that it happens on is the word with where the t does not get registered and you end up with wih.\nHere's how it's supposed to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*You press your left thumb down on the t, the popup appears showing that you're going to send a t, a click sound plays. Note: the finger hasn't released the t yet, and the t hasn't been sent yet.\n\n*You press your right thumb down on the h, the t is sent, the popup appears showing that you're going to send an h, the click sound plays.\n\n*If you move your left thumb, around the keyboard, nothing happens since it's considered a dead touch (my terminology). You must release this finger before it will register again. When it is released, nothing happens. Again, this is correct behavior.\n\n*When you release your right thumb on the h, the h is sent.\n\n\nWhat I believe it is registering when the bug happens is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*It detects a tap down on the t, plays a sound, shows the t popup, but doesn't send it yet.\n\n*It detects that the finger has moved to the h, and shows the h popup.\n\n*It detects that your finger was released, and it sends the h key.\n\n\nNotice how in the second scenario the t key was never sent and that it thinks that it's one finger rather than two. Notice, also, that in the first scenario you hear two click sounds and in the second, you only hear one. This is actually the way I know when the bug happens, by listening for missed click sounds.\nAlthough the example I gave with the word with may seem like it's much more likely since the t and h keys are very close by, this is actually not the case, and it frequently happens even with letters that are on opposite sides of the keyboard, such as n and d.\nNote that it never happens when I type slow, since I believe touches are processed much more accurately when they aren't being sent fast. This bug doesn't happen too often (e.g. 1-5% of the time), but it's still annoying.\nI'm wondering if this is a known bug or not. Has anyone else noticed this behavior? Before reporting it to Apple, it would help if I knew if other people have this issue too. \n\nA: I don't know that I would classify this as a bug.  In OS X, Apple has the Key Repeat Rate setting in the Keyboard preference pane which is a similar idea.  Apple currently provides no way to adjust the speed at which key press (more correctly, release) events are registered globally in iOS.\nThe ability to type over 70 wpm on the portrait iPhone keyboard is something most of us are unable to achieve, so it's unlikely it would be addressed by Apple.\n\nA: It used to happen to me all the time. You either have to use less area on your finger to tap the keys, or be more nimble in releasing.\n\nA: I have this issue. I searched for this exact description to see if other people were experiencing this problem.\nUsing iPhone typing test - http://www.iphonetypingtest.com/test.html I got a best score of around 62 wpm. Some of that may be due to failed autocorrect (a gripe for another day).\nI'm fairly sure I lift my thumbs from the screen clearly so I'm not actually dragging my thumb.\nThe biggest issue is when it doesn't register punctuation - a comma, say - and then I \"spacebar\" to get back to the alpha screen and it types numbers!\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3573", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: Is there a good command-line ID3 tool for OS X? Anyone know of a command-line* ID3 tool, with support for ID3v2, that you can get working on Mac OS X with reasonable effort? It should support both reading and writing tags.\n(* I want to be able to call it e.g. from some Python scripts, so a GUI tool won't do.)\nThe id3tool utility is otherwise good, but doesn't support ID3v2 (and thus doesn't play that well with iTunes). I had to compile it from source, but that was pretty straightforward on a Mac with Xcode & developer tools (including, notably, a C compiler). Anyway, I'd especially like something with similar command-line options as id3tool. Here's an example of tagging one file:\nid3tool -t \"Song Title\" -r Artist -a \"Album Name\" -c 2 track-02.mp3\n\n\nA: The python module Mutagen is shipped with the command-line ID3 tool named mid3v2 replacement for id3lib's.\nFrom the usage documentation : \n\nYou can set the value for any ID3v2 frame by using '--' and then a frame ID.\n  For example:\n          mid3v2 --TIT3 \"Monkey!\" file.mp3\n  would set the \"Subtitle/Description\" frame to \"Monkey!\".\n\n\nA: If you have Homebrew installed (highly recommended), you can just do:\nbrew install id3lib\n\nThis installs several id3 command-line tools, including id3tag, id3convert, id3cp and id3info.  No need for python or perl scripting; just use regular shell commands.\nUsage: id3tag [OPTIONS]... [FILES]...\n   -h         --help            Print help and exit\n   -V         --version         Print version and exit\n   -1         --v1tag           Render only the id3v1 tag (default=off)\n   -2         --v2tag           Render only the id3v2 tag (default=off)\n   -aSTRING   --artist=STRING   Set the artist information\n   -ASTRING   --album=STRING    Set the album title information\n   -sSTRING   --song=STRING     Set the title information\n   -cSTRING   --comment=STRING  Set the comment information\n   -CSTRING   --desc=STRING     Set the comment description\n   -ySTRING   --year=STRING     Set the year\n   -tSTRING   --track=STRING    Set the track number\n   -TSTRING   --total=STRING    Set the total number of tracks\n   -gSHORT    --genre=SHORT     Set the genre\n   -w         --warning         Turn on warnings (for debugging) (default=off)\n   -n         --notice          Turn on notices (for debugging) (default=off)\n\n\nA: You may want to try id3v2. It's based on the id3lib that Huyz mentioned, but seems to be a better command line tool than those with id3lib. It easily dumps the ID3V2 tags from iTunes produced MP3s, but not iTunes produced M4A files (as with Apple Lossless).\nIf you need M4A files, another option is ffmpeg. Its ffprobe command line tool prints out metadata in the files and I believe you can write metadata via ffmpeg. It works with both MP3 and M4A files produced by iTunes. ffprobe may not show all metadata; mp4v2 is another good option.\nAll three programs are easily installed via Homebrew. Right now (Jan 2012) ffmpeg requires gcc to compile, so brew install --use-gcc ffmpeg.\n\nA: Having had various 'abort trap' type issues with id3v2 I discovered eyeD3, which is a python module also existing as a command line tool. It seems to be more recently updated than some of the other programs mentioned above.\n\nA: There is always AppleScript. I'm not a big fan of it, but iTunes is scriptable and you can manipulate all the mp3 tags from there. You can invoke Applescript from the command line using osascript.\n\nA: This site: http://dougscripts.com/itunes/\nhas many good command line scripts and tools that layer on top of itunes to do things with your music library.  Some of them may do what you want.  Some of the tools are free and some are licensed.\n\nA: since you're comfortable with cli and Python, I can recommend some Perl modules on CPAN.  MP3::Tag, (as well as MP3::Tag::ID3v1 and ::ID3v2 and ::Utils), MP3::Info, MP3::ID3Lib are all available for reading and manipulating ID3 tags.\nIf you go to search.cpan.org and search for \"MP3\", you'll find a world* of options!\n(* Where \"world\" is a small, limited set of options...)\n\nA: This old thread at Mac OS X Hints looks like it might be a good place for you to start. It's from 2003, so I'm not sure if the tool they're talking about is still being developed. You also may have to compile it yourself.\n\nA: There's an OS X compatible version of the id3lib library available here on GitHub.

However, I have a disc that came with another computer.  Is it possible to install Mac OS X on the first computer using the disc I have? Do I need a serial number for this?\n\nA: The only Mac OS X that does have serial numbers is Server versions 10.6 and earlier. They know are licensed for 10 or unlimited users.\nThe only problem you may run into is that if you are trying to do the reinstall with a system disk rather than a plain old Mac OS disk. \nSay that other computer is a iMac and you are using the system disk from that one (one of those gray disks). The installers do have a little bit of code in them that check machine types, and may not let you install. Or, you may be able to install the OS, but none of the other applications (mainly iLife, etc). \nThis is not to hard to get around, since the main installer is what is checking - if you dig down on the disk, you can find the actual installer, which should work. \n\nA: Mac OS X doesn\u2019t have (nor had in the past) Serial Number or \u201cLegit Purchase\u201d mechanism. You can buy/borrow/lend/steal/copy a copy of Snow Leopard (or any other edition) and install it on any number of Machines.\nTechnically this is possible, however, according to the EULA and all the legal stuff, you can\u2019t; in any case, the operating system doesn\u2019t have any copy-protection mechanism.\nEDIT: Bear in mind that a plain OS X Snow Leopard disk is not the same as a recovery disk. Although a recovery disk contains the OS, it is usually tied to a particular model, so if you try to recover a Macbook Pro with the iMac recovery disk, that might not work. (This has happened to me in the past trying to recover the other way around, a friend\u2019s iMac\u2019s HDD failed and he replaced it but couldn\u2019t find his recovery disk. We tried to use my Macbook Pro\u2019s disk but it wouldn\u2019t work. The same with my Mac Pro. \nGoing to an Apple Store will possibly help in that case. In the end I found my Snow Leopard\u2019s original disk and we used that to install his iMac. \n\nA: There's no serial number to enter when installing Mac OS X.\n\nA: No you don't need a serial number to do a re-install.

Im pretty sure with the latest update for Pages on the iPhone lets you open and modify items on your iDisk. \nQuickOffice for the iPhone may let you edit docs, it says that it can save to your iDisk, so you may be able to open the files there and edit and save back to iDisk. \nThere are quite a few apps that do let you edit text files and save them to a Dropbox account, which (outside of mobile me) is much more popular.

{"text": "Q: Free tool to create a screencast to upload on hosting video platforms I would like to make a small video tutorial of a web application I deployed recently.\nCould you recommend some free programm to record screencast easily, ready to upload to video hosting platforms like youtube?\n\nA: For some reason, it was difficult to find this question, but I'm glad sentinel pointed out the solution I ended up using as well, which is QuickTime Player.\n\nWhat I'd like to add is how to capture system audio as well. This is in Mountain Lion (10.8).\nThere's a free, open-source tool called SoundFlower which creates a virtual input/output audio device. After installation, go into \u2018System Preferences\u2019 -> \u2018Sound\u2019, and from the \u2018Output\u2019 tab select the \u2018SoundFlower (2ch)\u2019 device. (If your application allows it, you may also change the output device just in the application you're recording.)\nNow, in QuickTime Player, open a new screen recording, and click the little down arrow on the right side of the window. From this drop-down menu, also select the \u2018SoundFlower (2ch)\u2019 device. Now record as normal.\n\nThe only problem with this solution is that you won't hear the application's sounds anymore, even though they're now being recorded. But there's a solution for that too: a multi-output that outputs to both your normal output and the virtual SoundFlower device.\nLaunch \u2018Audio MIDI Setup\u2019, either using Spotlight, or look in /Applications/Utilities/. Click the plus-button at the bottom left of the list of audio devices, and select \u2018Create Multi-Output Device\u2019. Now, with the new device selected, check the \u2018Use\u2019 boxes for your normal output device and the SoundFlower device.\nOn the left, expand the \u2018Multi-Output Device\u2019 and make sure there's a small clock icon next to your normal output. If not, right click it and select \u2018Use this subdevice as the master clock\u2019.\nNow you can set this device as your output, either straight from Audio MIDI Setup by right clicking it and selecting \u2018Use this device for sound output\u2019, or by selecting it in \u2018System Preferences\u2019 -> \u2018Sound\u2019 from the \u2018Output\u2019 tab. You'll both hear and record system sound now.\n\nA: This can be accomplished with QuickTime Player in Snow Leopard. From the File menu, select New Screen Recording. When you have finished recording, the video file will be opened for playback and from the Share menu, you can select YouTube....\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3602", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: Is there any known problem of using SIMBL? As the title, is there any known problem of installing SIMBL on my Mac? For example performance degradation, security problem, or anything else.\n\nA: Your question is too generic if anything. SIMBL have been the cause of past problems, specially when Snow Leopard was out; the infamous \u201cblue screen of death\u201d that made Windows very famous, affected OS X for a little bit on some machines that had \u201chacks\u201d like SIMBL (But it was usually caused by APE if I am not mistaken) \nWith that said, it\u2019s possibly \u201cimpossible\u201d to measure if there\u2019s any performance degradation or \u201canything else\u201d.\nI\u2019ve used SIMBL for a few years and I have no idea if I had run into issues that wouldn\u2019t have been caused should I not have it, however, for the most part it performs ok. There are a lot of plugins already written, one of them being the excellent Total Finder by BinaryRage. I\u2019d say that if there\u2019s a problem with SIMBL, it would be most of the times, caused by a bad plugin that is doing \u201cmore than it should\u201d.\nWith that said, I doubt Apple likes it when it\u2019s time to diagnose a problem. ;)\nWhen you create a Plug-in using SIMBL, there are a few recommendations that a lot of developers do not follow and that is what usually causes the problem. Most notably is the Version Checking. You are \u201centitled\u201d to make sure that the version of the application you\u2019re going to \u201chack\u201d, is compatible with whatever you\u2019re going to do. A lot of developers never did this in the past and the results were headaches for everybody.\nSuppose you\u2019re patching Safari 1.0. A software update comes and it\u2019s now Safari 1.1 and your plug-in doesn\u2019t work. You shouldn\u2019t try to patch that version of Safari until you fix your plugin. Failure to perform that check caused innumerable failures and rage wars :)\nYou can try it and if you detect issues, removing SIMBL later is pretty simple.\nBut after a few long years of having it, I can tell you that it\u2019s relatively safe; with that in mind, understand that SIMBL allows other applications to \u201cinject\u201d code into other Cocoa applications. A malicious user could attempt to cause damage though it. \nYou should keep an eye in the SIMBL Bug List to make sure you don\u2019t come across something that affects you and -of course- use known plug-ins and not something that came from \u201cp0rn.com\u201d. ;)\nNow if you\u2019re super worried about all you install and do, then stay away from it. :)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3616", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: Do Macs store a serial number on the disk? About a year ago, I sold my old MacBook Pro. Last week I got a call from the buyer who said that it had been stolen and he didn't have the serial number \u2014\u00a0and did I have it?\nI haven't been able to find it anywhere. It's not registered under my Apple ID (not sure it ever was). It was originally purchased from Amazon, and they don't put serial numbers on their receipts. I'm still looking for the original box.\nOTOH, I do still have a disk image that I made of the drive immediately before I reformatted it, prior to the sale.\nIs the serial number stored anywhere on that disk image?\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Searching my current MBP for my current serial number\nI figured that if I could find a file with the current serial number, the old disk image might have that same file with the old number.\n\n*Searching for old system profiler reports\nSadly, I couldn't find one.\n\n\nAnyone have any other ideas?\n\nA: Apparently the only ways to find out a Mac's serial number (if you don't have the Mac physically present) are:\nWhen you had the Mac, you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Registered it with Apple (check your support profile at apple.com)\n\n*Ran and saved a copy of System Profiler's output\n\n\nWithout the Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have a sales receipt from a retailer that puts the serial number on their receipts\n\n*Purchased it from a retailer that keeps track of serial numbers\n\n*Find the box the Mac came in\n\n\nThankfully, after I posted this question, the buyer was able to find the original box, which gave him the serial number.\nBut the actual answer to the question is: No, Macs do not normally store their serial number in a disk file.\n\nA: The computer\u2019s \u201cSerial Number\u201d is not stored in the software, but the hardware as far as I can remember (because there\u2019s a method in the Cocoa SDK to read it). \nYou can also ask the OS to tell you the Serial Number by going to /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app and executing:\nioreg -l | grep IOPlatformSerialNumber\n\nThis value, is stored in some form of nonvolatile memory on the motherboard, because you can wipe your hard drive completely clean, and the results will always be the same, until you have to change your board.\nAll that said, the vendor should have the serial number of the machine it sold, and Apple will know that the serial number went to X vendor. They have a decent control about that as far as I know. \nSo if you have the receipt from Amazon, then you can try contacting them about the issue. \n\nA: Hold your breath... MACs actually DO store serial number on the hard drive. After finding MAC address from my backup, I proceeded further and found the serial number itself in the same WirelessDiagnostics archive.   \nInside the archive there is a wifi-BPpiyL.log file which should contain the following lines: \n<airportd[30]> _initSystemGlobals: Model name = <your model name>\n<airportd[30]> _initSystemGlobals: Model number = <your model number>\n<airportd[30]> _initSystemGlobals: Serial number = **<your serial number>**\n\nI checked in Apple.com, and that was a valid S/N which showed the legitimate information about my stolen MacBook. Granted I've performed wireless diagnostics in the past and that's where these files came from, but it proves that if you have some kind of a backup, you have the chance in finding your S/N in it. \n\nA: Well, I had my Mac stolen and could not find the Serial No in the backup. The Mac used to be registered in my Apple ID, but is not any more. However, it still is in \"Find My Mac\", where I locked it.\nApple support wouldn't give me the serial number, saying they don't have it. However, when the police asked them which computers were tied to my Apple ID, they gave out the serial numbers.\nSo it seems to me that Apple does still have them, but is more cooperative with law enforcement than customers.\n\nA: I know this is old, but I'm sure lots of people are being redirected here from Google.\nOS X may not have the serial number of it's device stored anywhere, but chances are you can find your MAC address, which, just like the serial number, uniquely identifies your machine. One example where the MAC is being stored in OS X would be wireless_diagnostics-ilTACd.log which is located inside Wireless diagnostics archive (if exists).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3617", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}

Any recommendation, send the iMac back to Apple?\n\nA: I recommend you make sure it\u2019s not a perception issue and that the sound you\u2019re using to test the volume is always the same. \nPerhaps making a short \u201cvideo\u201d with another device of both moments (when it\u2019s high and when it\u2019s not), might help you make sure that this is not a crazy thing on your part. If the camera is left in the same place and the conditions are more or less the same, you should be able to clearly hear both videos and see a volume difference. \nIf you are sure that the volume tends to \u201cgo down\u201d and is not a software issue, then take the machine to Apple as soon as possible, because I\u2019ve never heard of decreasing speaker volumes. :)\n\nA: I've seen the same thing on my MacBook.  Unfortunately it's getting old and certainly out of warranty so it'd probably cost more to repair it than to just buy a new one (which would be faster/thinner, to boot).\nI assume it's a hardware issue, because I can't imagine this being caused by software.  I figure maybe somebody dropped a crumb in the keyboard and it landed in just the right (or wrong) place.\nIf you have a spare bootable hard disk, you could try booting from that.  Otherwise, yeah, have Apple take a look (er, listen) at it.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3631", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: Open iTunes when iPhone is connected on a Mac I remember that during the installation of iTunes (while I was upgrading it on my Mac) it asked if I want to install an application so that iTunes can be opened when my iPhone is connected.

{"text": "Q: What's a good Mac equivalent of WinMerge? WinMerge is an excellent and very powerful file merging tool, but as the name would imply, it's Windows only.  What's a good equivalent on the Mac?\n\nA: A modern, powerful, but paid (currently Mar-2013 $69.99) file merging application for OS X is Kaleidoscope. It handles folders, files, and even images. Ad copy from the page:\n\nCompare text in Blocks, Fluid and Unified layouts in both Two-Way and Three-Way modes. Quickly navigate and search through the most readable diff you've ever seen.\n\n\nA: Araxis Merge (http://www.araxis.com/merge_mac/index.html) is the gold standard in this area and has a similar cost (what is the weight of bits?).  There are Windows and Mac versions, and it is truly excellent if you find yourself spending a lot of time doing multiway diffs and merges (more common in these days of distributed version control systems).\nThe pricing starts (as of Sept 2011) at $129.\n\nA: You can use FileMerge, Apple's diff solution. It's free and it comes with every Mac OS X install.\nThe only downside is that you have to install the Developer Tools. You can find them on your DVD install that came when you bought your Mac (Snow Leopard or earlier). You can also get the developer tools from the App Store if your version of the OS supports that.\nThen, you can find it at /Developer/Applications/Utilities/FileMerge.app\n\nA: I've found the following applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*FileMerge (opendiff)\n\nIt's no longer bundled with Xcode Command Line Tools, you must install Xcode from either the App Store or the Apple Developer Website.\n\n\n*DiffMerge\n\n*Pretty Diff\n\nOpen sourced beautifier and language aware code comparison tool for many languages.\n\n\n*Meld\n\nCan be installed using Homebrew via command: brew install meld\n\n\n*TkDiff\n\nCan be installed using Homebrew via command: brew install tkdiff\n\n\n*TextWrangler\n\n*VisualDiffer\n\nAvailable on the App Store\n\n\n*Kaleidoscope\n\nCommercial with free trial.\n\n\n*Araxis Merge\n\nCommercial with free trial.\n\n\n*KDiff3\n\nNo longer in Homebrew, it has not been developed/updated since 2014.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Comparison of file comparison tools at Wikipedia\nfor the full list.\n\n*What file comparison tool can I use under OS X?\n\n*Portable, free, cross-platform, GUI-based prose-friendly plain-text diff and merge tool?\n\n*Code compare and merge tool for Mac OSX\n\nA: Maybe you will find the app SourceTree interesting: http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ SourceTree is a free Mac client for Git and Mercurial version control systems. Therefor it isn't a general purpose diff or merge tool but it is worth mentioning it.\n\nA: There's an application called SemanticMerge for Mac.\nSemanticMerge, as the name says :-), is a tool able to merge based on code structure instead of blocks of text. It basically means it parses the code first and then merges based on methods, classes and so on, so it is quite refactor friendly since it can match methods/functions even when they've been moved to different locations within the file.\nAt the time of writing this, Semantic supports .NET, C, Java, C++ and JavaScript.\n\nA: Beyond Compare is now in beta for the Mac. It's the best diff/merge program I\u2019ve used on Windows and is definitely worth checking out.\nhttp://www.scootersoftware.com/support.php?zz=kb_mac\n\nA: Perforce, a source control application, has a free * diff and merge tool that is cross platform and works fine on my mac. It's called P4Merge.\nhttp://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools\nIt presents file-diffs very nicely and handles three-way merges like a champ. As a long-time WinMerge user I was very happy with it. Its use of little gem-like icons in a 3-way merge takes some getting used to. One icon is for my change, one for their's, and one for the common ancestor. Once you get that straight it was very helpful.\n* it was free, but may now be subject to Perforce's licensing. Perforce in-general is restricted to a certain number of users and/or files unless you buy it. However, these restrictions only make sense when using their server-side software. These client-only tools can't really be licensed like that. I'll update if I ever hear back from the company on this matter.\n\nA: Agree with the recommendation for FileMerge.app.  You also have the free, cross-platform DiffMerge program, but I like FileMerge better.\n\nA: Stumbled upon this thread today and thought I'd contribute this new cross-platform OSS diff tool that supports file and directory comparision. It is a good alternative to WinMerge for Mac.\nhttp://meldmerge.org/\n\nMeld is a visual diff and merge tool targeted at developers. Meld helps you compare files, directories, and version controlled projects. It provides two- and three-way comparison of both files and directories, and has support for many popular version control systems.\nMeld helps you review code changes and understand patches. It might even help you to figure out what is going on in that merge you keep avoiding.\n\n\nA: I use VisualDiffer.\nIt's not as good as WinMerge, but pretty close and very cheap (only $34.99 at the moment!). It is promising.\nHere's a screenshot.\n\n\nA: I am a Mac user attached to elegance and esthetics as a significant factor in productivity for cognitive reasons. A fully native and elegant Human Interface is for me of paramount importance.\nI tried many contenders (Araxis, P4Merge and many others). I purchased several. I loved Changes for a long while. Now my favorite is Kaleidoscope. It provides 3-way merge, it can compare images in a smart way, it has a slick and elegant interface.\nWhen an application claims to be cross-platform, that rings an alarm bell. More often than not, it means an ugly, non-native interface. Having to cringe when working is not my idea of having fun at work.\n\nA: Meld is a good option..\nsteps to install meld on Mac :\n\n*\n\n*Install MacPorts:\nInstallation information can be found  in : MacPort installation\nBefore installing MacPort, you have to install Xcode and the Xcode Command Line Tools  if your computer doesn't have them.\n\n\n*Open your terminal  and  execute following  commands\ni) Installing rarian :\n\"sudo port install rarian\"\n\nII) Installing meld :\n\"sued port install meld\"\n\n\n*Configure the dbus service to start at boot\nI) sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist\n\nII) launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plistdf\n\n\n*Add LC_ALL variable to  the .bash_profile  file at  your /home  directory\nexport LC_ALL=en_US\n\n\n*Type meld command in the terminal and the application will be launched for you.\ngetting-meld-work-on-mac-os-x\n\nA: Changes - http://connectedflow.com/changes/\n\nA: Seems like there were plans to make WinMerge 3 available for Mac too:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://forums.winmerge.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=231\n\n*https://bitbucket.org/grimmdp/winmerge/issue/4/mac-os-x-use-winmerge-in-menu\n\nI haven't made my choice for Mac. But on Windows I use WinMerge, on Linux Meld (which is also available for Mac), currently using twdiff, I already tried FileMerge.app, and going to try DiffMerge.\nA note about Meld:\n\nMeld does work on OS X and Windows, but there are no all-in-one packages for those systems available at the moment. On OS X, Meld is available from MacPorts or Fink. \n\n\nA: My favorite free solution for merging the contents of files is KDiff3. KDiff3 can do two-way and three-way merges, has a decent GUI and has some pretty powerful features to assist with the merge.\nMy favorite non-free, but inexpensive ($30-ish) solution for merging the contents of files is Beyond Compare 3. Yes, Beyond Compare 3 is only available as a native Windows or Linux app, but I run it in WiNE via the easy to use Wineskin Winery app.\nWhen it comes to merging the content of directories both KDiff3 and Beyond Compare 3 can do it, but IMO KDiff3 is not very usable in this regard. Fortunately Beyond Compare 3 excels at directory merges, even on OS X.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3653", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "76"}}

I assume you want to have a list of \u2019singles\u2019 that are 1-4 stars rated. Why not add that to the conditions?\nNow your \u201cA\" list should be the same as before, but doesn\u2019t mention B at all.\nNow you happen to have a list \u201cB\u201d that has 5 rated songs (the good ones!).\nAnd now you want your less than 5 rated singles (A) of \u201cXX Genre\u201d, and your 5 star ones\u2026\nAs easy as it sounds, in practice it\u2019s more difficult\u2026 because what sounds like \u201cthis and that\u201d is not really like that.\nLet me try to replicate. \nMy \u201cA\u201d playlist is (I\u2019ve used Track = 1 but I\u2019m sure your condition to determine singles is different and I\u2019m taking 0,1,2 and 3 stars)\n\nMy B playlist is easier:\n\nNow I have a C one\u2026 that contains tracks from A that have a \u201cRock\u201d genre:\n\nWe\u2019re getting close!\nNow we need to group B and C into a single D playlist to enjoy the Joy of single Rocks and 5 start songs! \nHere\u2019s our D list:\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. Now two things are important:\n\n\n*\n\n*This song must always be in any playlist or you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\n*If you also want to include the \u201cgenre\u201d in the B playlist (is not clear), then modify B playlist to also have a \u201crock\u201d genre.\n\n\nAhhh the joy of playlists. :)\nEDIT: You specified two pseudo-contradictory things, but here\u2019s the idea:\n\nPlaylist B contains songs in my Library that are rated 5-stars\n\ncannot be intersected with:\n\nall songs for a specific genre in playlist A and B.\n\nIn order to achieve that, you\u2019ll have to modify (or create a B2) list that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Match All of the following rules:\n\n*\u201cRating is *****\u201d\n\n*Genre is \u201cRock\u201d\n\n\nYou can\u2019t modify a previous list from a new.

{"text": "Q: How to share an iTunes library with other user accounts on the same machine? I would like to share the iTunes library my the account of my wife.  \nBut (in importance order):\n\n\n*\n\n*files should not be duplicated\n\n*playlist and rating are user dependent\n\n*podcast are user dependent\n\n\nThen, she will managed her ipod with her account.\n\nA: There's an app called PowerTunes that will keep all of the meta-data for a library synchronized between multiple users on a machine. Playlists, ratings, play counts -- all of that stuff that isn't just the physical files. It'll obviously keep all of the iTunes instances for all users aware of all the current physical files on disk too.\n\nA: I was going to start explaining you what you can (and can\u2019t) do or how hard was this going to be, but a single google query lead me to this excellent thread an Apple forum.\nI\u2019m going to quote the relevant part, but I suggest you read it all because there\u2019s more information there and more \u201cwhy\u201d questions.\nWe assume you have copied all the music to a Central location (be it a machine or a NAS drive or whatever), so somewhere in the network or your harddrive all your music files (library) are accessible to your wife and you (and theoretically both can write to that location, important when adding files). \nIt doesn\u2019t matter if they are in different computers or just accounts.\nWith that in mind: \n\n\n*\n\n*Each future user of the library should launch iTunes with the Option key held down and Create Library. (A blank one). \n\n*With this new iTunes window open, go into iTunes Preferences and UN-check \"Keep iTunes Music folder organised\" and \"Copy files to iTunes Music folder when adding to library\".\n\n*Then, they must add the music to the Library, selecting the tracks from the folder where all the music is stored (the common place mentioned above), which will import all the tracks into this new Library without copying the files again (hence why step #2).\n\n*From this point they can create their own playlists and stuff and they can even check the things they unchecked in step #2, in case they decide to add new tracks (see drawback), you\u2019ll want to have them in the central location. \nFrom this point they both have a Library.XML (stores playlists, tracks location, etc.) and that library.xml points to the physical mp3/4 on the \u201ccommon location\u201d (tracks are not duplicated as you requested).\nDRAWBACK (and the fact that there\u2019s no better solution):\nIf either user of the library adds new music, regardless of the \u201ckeep music organized\u201d and \u201ccopy files\u201d checkboxes, the other user(s) are not going to see the changes. The reason being that they are modifying their local copy of the library \u201cxml\u201d (which is where all the playlist and stuff is stored). \nIf USER1 adds 1 track, USER2 will have to find the track in the library and manually add it to his/her own library. \nAs you can see, iTunes was not really designed for multiuser.\nGo ahead and read the post, it will give you more pros/cons and maybe other ideas. \nEDIT: one way to know \u201cwhat is new\u201d in the library folder (where the music is actually stored) would be to create a smart folder that shows files added in the last \u201cxx\u201d days (for example). :)\n\nA: You should make ~/Music/iTunes/ a symlink to a shared location accessible to all users of the computer.\n\nA: The best way is to sign in to iTunes match on both accounts.

{"text": "Q: Is there a way to fix these scratches on my MacBook Pro's screen? I have the Mid-2010 13\" MacBook Pro. Sadly, the Keyboard Keys have caused some scratches in the screen, which is annoying as hell. (Yes, I know, I should use the white buffer sheet that came with it)\nIs there a way to fix these scratches? Or so I need a really expensive replacement screen cover?\n \n\nA: I'm surprised no else one has said it yet:\nThis is a nearly brand-new MacBook Pro still covered by warranty.\nThere is absolutely no reason that your keyboard keys should damage the display like that.  This is a design flaw that has existed in their laptops at least as far back as the PowerBook G4.  The keys should not touch the screen when the lid is closed under any circumstances, but they invariably do.\nI have to clean my screen every few days to get rid of the keyboard imprints, but luckily have taken no damage to the screen (probably only because I use the awesome Moshi keyboard cover, which also saved my MBP from a hot tea disaster).\nTake it to Apple and make them fix it under warranty!\n\nA: If it\u2019s only the glass and you don\u2019t want apple to do it for you (and charge you accordingly) you can do it yourself. Get one of these (make sure it\u2019s the right model for your macbook) and start unscrewing stuff :)\nRemember that Apple does not sell these parts and therefore these are \u201ccopies\u201d of it. According to every vendor \u201cthey are the same, they look the same, you won\u2019t notice the difference\u201d. But\u2026 they are vendors. I don\u2019t have experience with these things. \nThis Google Query may bring other results. It\u2019s not impossible (I have opened a Macbook Pro Unibody) but it requires patience and the right tools. Check iFixIt for pictures of stripped Macbooks and possibly guides on how to \u201copen them\u201d. More specifically, check this area, where it explains how to change the front display glass.\nBear in mind that doing any of this will break your warranty. Unless you pay Apple to do it (and charge you accordingly).\nI\u2019d first go to an Apple Store and \u201cask\u201d what are the options, they may be \u201ccool\u201d and give you a hand.\n\nA: This might sound crazy, but I've fixed nasty scratches in CDs and DVDs with plain toothpaste. Not minty-gel-crystal-whitening-all-in-one toothpaste, just plain, humble, white chalk, flouride toothpaste (some do still exist in the major chain stores). Just a small amount buffed in with a cotton wash cloth did the trick. Maybe that would work here?\n\nA: I had a scratch on my 27\" Mac monitor. It is a glass screen and unfortunately the scratch was right in the middle and very distracting.\nI too was very leery about putting toothpaste on my precious screen, but after googling around I was not getting any better answers so I decided to give it a try.\nI took a little bit of toothpaste. It was not the \"simple\" kind of toothpaste mentioned above but one of the ones with all the other stuff added. I suspect the kind of toothpaste does not matter.\nI used a piece of white computer paper to rub the toothpaste on the scratch. One YouTube video that I saw said paper worked better than tissue so I went with that. And the verdict? It works! If I look very closely I can still see the scratch but it is way better now. \nIt took me about of 5-10 minutes of rubbing. I went pretty slow because I was paranoid that I was going to screw up my screen, but there do not seem to be any ill effects.\nI strongly recommend you give this a try. Note that this will only work with glass screens.\n\nA: This happened to me on two other notebooks. Fixing this is a pain and it's costly. Tried buffing, but it was not exactly successful. Replacing the screen was traumatic for me and expensive. I suppose that's why it was traumatic...\nAlthough this might be considered a shameless plug, I created a product to prevent this stuff. Just launched it on IndieGoGo: igg.me/at/scudo\nIt's made from authentic Ultrasuede and called Scudo. The SRP is only $15, and just $10 during the campaign. This is about the only kind of thing that will prevent this from happening.\nI hope this helps in the future.

{"text": "Q: What are the specific restrictions on downgrading an iPod Touch to previous iOS versions? We want to test our iOS app on a few devices (iPhone 3G and 4 - or equivalent iPod Touch), but we also need to ensure it will run on the major releases of iOS, maybe 3.0.x, 3.1.x, 4.0.x, etc - I'm a little rusty on the version numbers and who got free upgrades to what.\nI've read Is there a way to downgrade a 2nd gen iPod touch from iOS 4 back to 3.1.3? but I'm still unclear whether or not we can just buy a single iPod Touch and downgrade and upgrade as necessary, or if we'd have to buy an iPod Touch per iOS version we want to test.\nSo, what are the specific restrictions placed on downgrading? Can we just get our devices into DFU mode and apply whatever version we want? I don't want to end up buying a lot of devices if we only need one each.\nWe don't need any phone-only hardware such as the microphone or sending SMSs, so that's not a factor.\nCheers!\n\nA: (I'm not certain of this answer -- it's a somewhat educated hunch, based on using iPods for 10 years and Apple products for 25, and looking at wikipedia.  If anyone knows from actual experience, use that answer instead.)\nIn general, I would guess that you can downgrade an iPod to the version of the OS that it was released with, but not earlier.  So, for example, an iPod Touch 2g could probably be downgraded to iPhone OS 2.1, but not 1.1 (which wouldn't really matter since there was no App Store in 1.x!).  Each iPod Touch gen-N ships with the N.1 release of iOS, about a month after the corresponding iPhone ships with the N.0 release.\nAn iPod Touch 2g should run all versions of iOS for the iPod Touch that have an App Store, though it doesn't support all the features of iOS 4.  The hardware differences between iPod models might be a bigger issue for testing, e.g., older iPods don't have a built-in microphone.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3705", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

Currently I'm opening those volumes as a Login Item under System Preferences > Accounts.\nThis works, but it unfortunately also pops up each volume in a new Finder window on boot up. Checking the hide on the items only hides the processes, not the resulting Finder window from those processes. A solution that avoids those Finder popups would be great.\nI'd like to avoid any 3rd party apps to accomplish this too.\n\nA: I found this script from http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050215082247458, but I'll reproduce it below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up Script Editor and paste in: \n\n\n\n    set sfiles to \"afp://user:pass@host/volume\"  \n    tell application \"Finder\"  \n        mount volume sfiles   \n    end tell\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace sfiles with the appropriate details of your AFP volume.\n\n*Add appropriate other lines for the other servers you have, both above and inside the tell\n\n*Save this script somewhere safe and add it to the login item pane (instead of the Volumes you have there now)\n\n\nA: TL;DR\nUse AppleScript, but do not specify the user name or password.\n\nBackground\nIn my case, none of the suggestions that I found online worked perfectly.\nI had several AFP volumes that I wanted to mount automatically. Following the advice given here and elsewhere, the obvious solution seemed to be an AppleScript file with something along these lines:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    try\n        mount volume \"afp://user@server/a\"\n        mount volume \"afp://user@server/b\"\n        mount volume \"afp://user@server/c\"\n    end try\nend tell\n\nNow, this almost works. From the perspective of Finder, it looks as if all volumes are correctly mounted. However, if you use the terminal, you can see the problem. The following has happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*The volumes are mounted on directories /Volumes/a, /Volumes/b-1, and /Volumes/c-1.\n\n*There are empty directories /Volumes/b and /Volumes/c.\nWhether you care about it depends on your intended use, but I needed a solution in which the file system paths are more predictable.\nAfter spending a lot of time playing with all variants of this, it seems that the crucial thing is the following: If you specify the user name and you have already mounted some volumes from the same AFP server, things go wrong.\nHence the following solution.\n\nSolution\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that everything works correctly when you use Finder: you can mount volumes by clicking on the share, and you do not need to enter any passwords. If Finder asks for a user name and password, tell it to remember the password.\n\n*Create an AppleScript application as follows. Open AppleScript Editor. Write a piece of code like this:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    try\n        mount volume \"afp://server/a\"\n        mount volume \"afp://server/b\"\n        mount volume \"afp://server/c\"\n    end try\nend tell\n\nHere \"server\" is the host name of the server (if Finder displays the server name \"x\", you can try to use the host name \"x.local\"). Replace \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" with the names of the volumes that you want to mount. Make sure you do not try to specify any user names or passwords. Compile and save it, using the file format \"Application\" (you will get the file name extension \".app\" automatically).\n\n*Test it by running the application that you just created. Most likely it asks for the user name and password; enter them and again tell it to remember the password.\n\n*Unmount (using Finder), and try it again. It should just work, without asking anything. The paths should be correct (no -1 suffixes).\n\n*Add the application to your login items (System Preferences; Users & Groups).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3741", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

It is on a network drive.

I opened the .aplibrary package, and simply removed it.\nOn restarting Aperture, everything seems to still work fine, though the thumbnails do load slightly slower.\nThis reduces the .aplibrary to 1.49 GB, which is at least smaller then the actual library files, but is still absurdly large.\nWhat the heck is going on? \n\nA: Given your 12,000 images are 2.61 GB in total, they're about 228 kB each \u2014\u00a0is this right? and is this typical of your entire 280 GB of photos?\nBy default, Aperture makes previews and thumbnails to speed things up, based on the assumption that your images are quite large (e.g. 2+ MB) and loading + displaying them will take a long time.\nFor low resolution cameras, Aperture wastes quite a bit of space (relatively speaking)... but you can improve it somewhat...\nDisable/shrink previews\nIf this size is typical of your entire library, you should probably disable the automatic creation of previews since they'll be pretty redundant for 228 kB images:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Aperture Preferences, go to the Previews tab and uncheck the box for automatic generation of previews for new projects\n\n*In the library, click on Photos (at least in 3.x, in older versions you may need to make a search for all photos?), select all, click \"Delete Preview\".\n\n\nIf you really want previews, but want them lower quality/size, then change the settings in Preferences and then make sure you select all photos, right click and \"Update Preview\". You might need to delete them first if it says they're already up to date.\nNot much you can do about thumbnails\nAccording to this apple article, Aperture thumbnails are 1024x768 resolution JPGs, and I know of no way of disabling their creation. For low resolution images, this is obviously pretty silly/redundant, since the speed-up will be minimal. Other than complaining to Apple (that \"fixed size thumbnails even for low resolution images is stupid\"), I'm not sure what you can do here. :(\nI have a library of 34,000 photos which has produced 22 GB of thumbnails, an average of 680 kB per thumbnail. For your 12,000 photos 4.9 GB of thumbnails its about 430 kB per thumbnail. This overhead doesn't really bother me, because my 12 megapixel JPG images are 2-5 MB each (and RAWs are more like 20 MB), but for a library of smaller (say 2 to 5 megapixel) images, the thumbnails aren't that much smaller than the masters...\nJust a warning, that according to posts like this one, Aperture will slowly regenerate your thumbnails, so while you can delete them to save space, they'll slowly come back.\nIf you've only tried with your smaller photos from an older camera, and your newer one has bigger files, then you'll see a big improvement in the amount of space \"wasted\" in thumbnails once you put the larger photos in. 280 GB of 288 kB photos seems unlikely (1.3 million photos?!) so I'm guessing you've got some much larger images in there... in which case it might be okay in the long run...\nShould be easy enough to calculate the Aperture thumbnail waste from the total number of images multiplied by about 500 kB per thumb.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3743", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}

{"text": "Q: Can I use iPhoneBrowser to upload a directory structure to Office Connect? I want to use my iPod touch to view and edit word documents.  I've found a free app (Office Connect) that seems to allow this.  However, the way that this app wants you to upload files is to connect to an IP address and upload files one at a time.  I have a while directory structure for my files that I want to maintain, and I have too many files to upload them one at a time.\nI've come across another app called iPhoneBrowser, which appears to fill this gap.  However, I can't fathom the directory structure of my iPod.  For example, the OfficeConnect app comes with a sample document called \"QuickOffice.doc\", but I can't find this in iPhoneBrowser.\nAm I missing something here - can I use iPhoneBrowser for this, or if not, is there another app that does what I want?\n\nA: My suggestion would be to get DataViz's Documents To Go. It provides the capability of editing Word documents on your iOS device and the 'premium' version interfaces with Dropbox (or similar services) to synchronize the changes to and from your PC. I haven't personally used their iOS version, but I did use their Palm version several years ago and it worked quite well.\n\nMicrosoft Word Editing\nView, edit and create Microsoft Word documents on the go and experience the freedom of being able to review and update any of the Word documents you rely upon; anytime, anywhere. Advanced viewing and editing features include touch navigation, cut/copy/paste, bulleted and numbered lists, fonts, embedded pictures, tables, word count, password-protected files and the ability to edit in landscape view.\nOnline/Cloud Documents Support\n('Documents To Go Premium' only)\n  Download, view and edit your files from your Google Docs, Box.net, Dropbox, MobileMe iDisk or SugarSync account directly in Docs To Go. Any changes you make can be saved and synchronized back to the online account so that you'll always have the most up-to-date version. You can even create new files in Docs To Go and upload them immediately to your account.\n\n\nA: The paid version of quick office (quick office connect mobile suite I think it's called) allows you to add various online storage services: google docs, dropbox, box.net and mobile me. You upload/sync your files on your computer to one of these services then add your account to quick office and you will be able to access and write to the files on the service you added. \nQuickoffice also has local storage where you can download files to from one of the services. This is useful if you know you'll want to access a big file when your not on wifi. You can download it while on wifi and then access it later offline. \nAnd vice versa you can create a document locally when and the upload it to a service later.  \nEach iPhone app has it's own sandbox which it can modify and read. It can't see or modify any other apps sandbox. So iPhone browser will only see files you added using iPhone browser. iOS 4 now has a documents facilty where if an app can read a word document such as quickoffice it registers that it cam do that and if an app can list files such as the official dropbox app you can open a document in the dropbox app and it will show a Hutton which you can press to open the document in quick office. \nQuickoffice also has the ability to openema attachments.

Is it possible to set up an iPhone 4 to send/receive FaceTime calls with my email address instead of my phone number?\n\nA: On the iPhone itself, you are unable to add \"e-mail address aliases\" like in the OSX App. The only method of having people call your iPhone is by giving them your phone number.\nAs far as the iPhone making facetime calls, the only easy way I've seen to do it is to already have their Facetime address in your Address Book, or use Safari.\nOpen Safari on your iPhone, go to the URL bar, type: <facetime://their@email.addr>, then tap the \"Facetime\" acknowledgement button afterwards.\n\nA: I'm not following why everyone else is saying this can't be done.

{"text": "Q: Are there any limits of re-downloading applications from appstore? I've got an application on my iPhone which was free when I installed it and now it became paid application. One day I accidentally deleted it from device and then was able to download it from Appstore for free (as I \"had the previous version\" of that app). \nSo now I just wonder are there limits for that (number of devices I can do that on, any time limits etc)? \nEdit: The only thing that I managed to find so far is the following paragraph in iTunes Store \"Terms and Conditions\":\n\nSolely as an accommodation to you,\n  some Products may be redownloaded for\n  use in accordance with the Usage\n  Rules. Not all Products are eligible\n  for this accommodation or may be\n  available at any given time.

Also, once you have that app, you have it even if the price changes, goes from free to paid or vice versa. \nOne thing that I have seen happen in the app store, is developers releasing a whole new version of their app, and naming it differently,  launching it differently. A perfect example of it is Tweetie. When they went to version 2, he re-released it as a new app (Tweetie 2), therefore making anyone who wanted to get the new one to have to pay (even if they paid for the first). Then, that app was converted to free and changed to Twitter for iPhone, but if you bought Tweetie 2, you just got an update that changed it. \n\nA: \n\"Not all Products are eligible for\n  this accommodation.\"\n\nI really think this is just them covering themselves for unforeseen circumstances, but the truth is you should never have to worry about getting charged again for the same exact app (free updates included). The only real risk is if the app gets pulled or the dev removes it. I have personally re-downloaded hundreds of apps, so you can trust me.\nIn contrast, downloading music from iTunes is not the same.

{"text": "Q: Taking care of the hard drive in my MacBook? Is it bad for my MacBook if I simply close the lid and pack it up? Will this impact the hard drive?\nWhat about using it in a moving vehicle, like a car?\n\nA: Assuming your computer has a magnetic drive (and not a SSD), when you close the lid, it will take a few seconds for the computer to write some things to the hard-drive; even if it looks fast, it really takes a few secs of \u201cbackground activity\u201d. It could be 1 sec, but it\u2019s there. \nSo as a general rule, it\u2019s always good to gently close the lid (hitting the lid with the keyboard can cause damage to the screen and the hard-drive if it\u2019s too strong), and give the computer a couple of seconds to process the sleep state. Once you\u2019re sure that the box is sleeping, you can pack it up and carry it, always remembering that the Hard-Drive is a mechanical device and as such, it\u2019s very fragile (compared to other pieces). This doesn\u2019t mean that you have to treat your box as if it were Murano glass, but mechanical drives and hits are not friends. With that said, I\u2019ve seen laptops fall from 1 meter (tables) to the floor and work for years without a hard drive failure, and on the other hand, small hits against a table (by raising the laptop 1 cm and letting it fall onto a table) rendered hard drives inoperative. \nSo as you can see the drives tend to be more fragile than not, even when you can never be sure. \nI remember about 10 years ago, we were on vacations and for some reason, one of the guys found a box of Sugus candies and we started a fight. Note: They hit really hard and I have pictures of a candy tatooed in my back in red. All in all, one of these candies bounced and hit a guy\u2019s laptop while he was creating a playlist in WinAmp (yeah, we were that old). The computer crashed (Windows XP) and the hard drive never worked again.\nThe candy story was just a way to illustrate that you can never be sure about hard drives.\nRegarding a car: unless you\u2019re going to go to the Camel Trophy, there shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Remember, vibrations and hits may hurt your hard drive, keep it as quiet as possible. \nthey guy whose laptop broke still hates us.\nI have an old macbook that I carry everywhere, on and off and I drop in bed, I move it, I put things on top of it (books, etc). and it still works\u2026\n\nA: All MacBooks (including Pros and Airs) have a Sudden Motion Sensor, which parks the hard drive heads when it senses that the laptop is falling or that there's excessive vibration.

{"text": "Q: Options for itunes-filled disk? I haven't bought any TV shows on iTunes, but my boss has -- many. His MacBook Pro's 250GB disk is more than half filled with TV shows (mostly sitcoms for entertainment during travel). Most of the rest of the disk is filled with other stuff.\nI see a couple options for clearing up some space currently occupied with TV shows:\n\n\n*\n\n*buy a bigger disk (go to Apple store\nand have them swap out the 250GB\nmodel with the 500GB model)\n\n*move some of the tv shows to an external disk and help him restore when needed\n\n*backup itunes library and then just nuke\n\n\nI've looked around on apple's site and on some other pages about backing up iTunes and it doesn't seem like #2 is easy to do from within iTunes. The full iTunes backup (#3) is more straightforward, but I think a full initial backup will take a couple dozen DVDs. \nThe hurdle for buying a new disk is the cost plus the downtime while the Apple store is performing the installation and copy.\nAre there other, better options that I've missed? Has anybody done any of my suggested options?\n\nA: Regarding option number 1, the Apple Stores do not do hard drive upgrades.  You will need to take it to an authorized 3rd party or if it is a recent model MacBook Pro i would recommend just doing it yourself.  It is fairly easy and iFixit has a step by step guide on their site http://www.ifixit.com/Browse/Mac.  A 500gb hard drive should be relatively inexpensive on newegg.com or amazon.com, and i would also recommend going with a 7200rpm.  \nI upgraded my late 2009 13\" MacBook Pro to a 320gb 7200rpm Western Digital drive from newegg and have been pretty happy with the performance.\nFor option number 2, all you have to do is drag the tv show out of itunes and on to another drive.  Once it is transfered you can delete it from itunes.  Keep in mind that you probably want to keep a back up of the drive you transfer the shows to or else if that drive fails you have lost the content.\n\nA: \n2.\u00a0move some of the tv shows to an external disk and help him restore when needed\n\nIf your boss has another Mac or PC running iTunes, he can set up Home Sharing and move content back and forth from his MacBook as needed. This option is appealing because it's contained within iTunes and doesn't involve manually copying files and deleting/re-adding them to the iTunes library.\n\nA: Do not use DVDs as backup, short or long term. You are much better off using some kind of arrayed disk solution (like a Drobo or something on the network).\nBackup (regularly, to an external hard drive) and buy a bigger disk. Which will be more expensive: having a new hard drive installed or simply losing all of that content?\nFinally, put in place a sensible policy on what (I assume is) company hardware is to be used for. When my IT group sees so much has 1 MB of non-work files they go nuclear.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3800", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

I recently replaced the logic board on my Mac, now I have this \"fan constantly on at 6000RPM all the time\" issue.\nSo I did an Apple hardware test using the installation disk that came with my Mac and got this cryptic error:\n4SNS/1/40000000:Th2H-128.000\nAfter some googleing I came across this:\nTh2H Right Fin Stack Proximity Temp\nAnd my question(s), what part does the Right Fin Stack Proximity Temp refer to?\nIs the error given by the Apple Hardware Test considered 100% accurately?\n\nA: This is a guess but I would assume it's referring to the Temperature sensor next to the heat sink exhaust for the right fan.  That would definitely account for your fan running at max... if the sensor is not reporting the temperature, the logic board would likely turn the fan on full blast in order to keep the processor from overheating or even setting the computer aflame.\nYou might have just forgot to plug the temp sensor in, or left it loose, or it became loose during your board replacement.  Or it could have failed...\nTry using a temperature monitoring app like Temperature Monitor and see if it gives you any more info.\n\nA: The best solution is to use the app Macs Fan Control (Free), and setting it to control the fans using the GPU (or whatever sensor usually shows the highest temperature) instead of the malfunctioning sensor.\nDuring start, the fans will run high, but when Macs Fan Control kicks in, the fans runs exactly how you want them run.\nDownload from http://www.crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3807", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I print a booklet from a pdf file? I have a pdf document, and I want to print it as a booklet, i.e. two pages of the document on each side of a sheet of paper and so that (when printed) the entire thing can just be folded in the middle to create a small booklet.\nHow can I do this easily?\n\nA: \"Booklet printing\" is called imposition in the terminology of the professional printing business.\nCheap Impostor\nis a utility for doing exactly what you want. It costs US $35, and has a free trial with some features disabled. It is affordable for casual use, but also good enough for professional imposition.\n\nA: Open the PDF in preview, go to the print dialog and you'll find some (hopefully) helpful settings\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I say hopefully as I've not done exactly what you're after...\nClick the little down arrow next to the printer name to expand the print dialog if its not already larger. In the bottom half of the dialog window, there's a drop-down menu where you can select a few relevant options:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Layout (in the drop-down menu), Pages per Sheet (you can set this to 2 to have a left and right side on each page)\n\n*Also in Layout, Two-Sided (you can choose the paper edge over which the binding would occur \u2014\u00a0not sure how this works for folding in the middle though...\n\n*The drop-down also has a section called Booklet Printing, which has various options that will be of interest to you, mostly the first checkbox to enable booklet printing :)\n\n\nNow I've not done it myself, and I don't know if it'll work for folding the pages in the middle (it looks like its intended for binding the pages along one edge) but that's probably the place to start looking.\nIf it doesn't work as is, then you may need to manually rearrange the pages (which you can do in Preview) to be in the right order so that simple double sided printing with short-edge binding puts the pages in the right places, though this may be quite difficult if there's a lot of pages...\nGood luck...\n\nA: You can use the free python script here. Just add it to your PDF Services folder in your user Library (create the folder if it doesn't exist). It will then appear in the PDF button of your print menu. \nIt's set for A3 sheets, but there are options to change the sheet size (and other things) in the script.\n\nA: For a free and universal alternative you can use the pdfbook script, part of the pdfjam collection which is usually included in LaTeX distributions (notably MacTeX). It's simple to use from the command line:\npdfbook mypdf.pdf\n\nIf the above doesn't work, then /Library/TeX/texbin isn't in your PATH (or /usr/texbin for older versions of MacTeX). The best course of action is to ensure PATH is correctly set (lots of command line programs will fail if the PATH variable isn't correct and pdfbook is one of them); this isn't trivial under OS X if you want a consistent behavior between applications launched from the dock and applications run from a terminal so you definitely should search a complete solution to this specific problem. As dirty work-around, you can run export PATH=\"$PATH:/Library/TeX/texbin:/usr/texbin\" every time before you use pdfbook (including in the service below).\nIf you don't want to use the command line, you can create a service easily.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator (on Yosemite it's in Applications/Others)\n\n*Create a new document and select \"Service\".\n\n*On top of the right frame, for \"Service receives selected\" choose \"PDF files\".\n\n*Search \"Run Shell Script\" from the bar on the top of the left frame and double-click it. Select to \"Pass input\" as \"arguments\" in the newly created window.\n\n*Enter a simple script running pdfbook, for instance pdfbook \"$@\".\n\n*Save it as \"Create booklet\" (for instance).\n\n*In Finder, select a PDF file, then in the menu go to Services/Create booklet.\n\n\nMy complete script also creates a temporary file and opens the resulting PDF:\nTMPF=`mktemp -t bookletXXXX`\nmv \"$TMPF\" \"$TMPF.pdf\"\npdfbook -o \"$TMPF.pdf\" \"$@\"\nopen \"$TMPF.pdf\"\n\nThe most obvious problem is the several GB download and installation of a LaTeX distribution if all you want is the pdfbook script.\n\nA: You can use the Create Booklet utility1 which adds an option to \u201cprint\u201d, from Preview or any other app, to generate a second pdf file with the pages arranged appropriately to print and bind as a booklet. When printing the resulting pdf booklet, remember to select \u201cTwo-Sided: Short-Edge binding\u201d in the \u201cLayout\u201d options of the print dialog.\n1. No longer free, $9.99 on the App Store as of 09/2015.\n\nA: My solution is to install Macintosh version of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, available from https://get.adobe.com/reader/, and use it to open the PDF file. When printing from Adobe Reader, there is several options in page sizing and handling :\n\n\n*\n\n*Poster\n\n*Multiple\n\n*Booklet\n\n\nChoose Booklet and you're good to go.\n\nSee https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/print-booklets-acrobat-reader.html for more detail. The advantage of this solution that the same solution also works in the Windows world.\n\nA: There is a nice App in the AppStore called booklet for about $ 1.00:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/booklet/id1375737884?l=en&mt=12\nIt has a couple of options and does exactly what you want. \n\nA: This capability has been added to the native preview app within macOS Catalina - no need to download anything else.\nIn the print dialog, click \"Show Details\" (if you haven't already), then change the selector from \"Preview\" to \"Layout\". You should now see a setting for \"Two-Sided\" and you can select \"Booklet\". I also like to select a thin border to see that proper printed pages.

{"text": "Q: iTunes on iMac plays media on Linux server via SMB. What's with the slow imports, changes and stalls? I posted this on SuperUser, but it's probably more appropriate here.\nI have an unRAID server (If you're unfamiliar with unRAID, you can check it out at lime-technology.com) which is a Linux based server. I'm getting terrible performance with iTunes on my iMac. The music playback is fine. But if I import a song file or change any metadata, it has problems. This isn't new, I've read many, many posts complaining about this and other problems concerning SMB shares and file systems. But I think I may be onto something and would like some advice.\nThis is what I've found so far. Snow Leopard, OS 10.6.x, has a problem with SMB and/or any file system other than HFS+. HFS+ is the common files system for OS X.\nThere are hundreds of posts on the web complaining about temporary freezes, slowdowns, sometimes crashes on the Mac using SMB shares and other file systems. I have yet to see Apple acknowledge that there is a problem, but there are a few suggestions out there that seem to have helped people. I'll be trying out some of these this week and post the results here.\nFrom my own observations, specifically with iTunes, I've noticed some strange behavior. Here's my setup. I have an iMac running 10.6.4 (the latest update), the latest iTunes 10. The iTunes app is located on the local internal HD, I have my iTunes library files and all my media on disk 1 of my unRAID server. I'm hard wired to the server via a gigabit router. I have iTunes set to keep the media organized and copy the media files to the server.\nWhen importing a song file into iTunes, the file initially seems to copy at a good rate, the file appears in it's proper place and you can see the size increasing as it copies. Then it stalls for a while, then the name changes to a long hex number for a few seconds and then reverts back to its' normal state. The process can take 30-40 seconds, even with a small song file. I looked at the console and I got the following error message:\n\n11/8/10 12:24:28 AM /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes[2820] Possible unresolved transaction race -103/(Master Music Library/John Lennon/Rock 'N' Roll,(null))\n\nThe same thing happens when I make a change in the metadata. It takes a LONG time to update the file.  For example, I added onto the name of an album and for each song it changed I got:\n\n11/8/10 12:37:36 AM /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes[2820] Possible unresolved transaction race -103/(Master Music Library/John Lennon/Signature Box Set 5 - Walls And Bridges,(null))\n\nThis happens for each file imported or changed even within iTunes.  It doesn't seem to matter if the source file is on the Mac (for import from, let's say) or the server (for metadata changes, let's say)\nI followed the first path in the error message: /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes[2820].\nIn the /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/ folder I find the following files:\n\niTunes\nlibgnsdk_musicid.1.7.1.dylib\nlibgnsdk_sdkmanager.1.7.1.dylib\nlibgnsdk_submit.1.7.1.dylib\n\nwhere iTunes is a Unix Executable File.\nI did some more research and have found some posts about file systems other than HFS+ having trouble with app packages. I believe that all OS X apps are actually packages, like folders, but appearing as a single file. Other file systems don't seem to know what to do with these. There was some talk of \"flattening\" these app packages, but I haven't gone forward with that yet because I'm not sure I understand it enough yet.\nI've also noticed that in the getinfo box under sharing & permissions I usually get \"You can read and write\", but with apps I get \"You have custom access\". This was something i had noticed before and thought it was a problem on the server, but I didn't realize it until now, I'm getting the custom access on every app. So I think that's probably normal.\nI'm wondering if I'm having a permissions problem with the iTunes Unix Executable File. Right now the permissions are set as follows:\n\nsystem: Read & Write\nadmin: Read & Write\neveryone: Read only\n\nMaybe it's trying to write to that file or another one and doesn't have the right permissions since the song file is now on the server and that's causing the stalls? I'm over my head here. Anyone have any ideas?\n\nA: A few places you could consider some testing to find the problem...\nNetwork\n\n\n*\n\n*What physical (network) hardware connects the unRAID server and the Mac?\n\n*How long are any cables?\n\n*Are your network cables old/damaged/kinked at all?\n\n*Are you using a wireless network?\n\n*What's the ping time between the unRAID server and the mac?\n\n*Can you run a long term ping between (ideally with large packet sizes) and see how the response time varies and whether there's any packets lost?\n\n\nIt sounds like it might be a case of high latency or packet loss in the file system access causing issues. If so, then an unreliable network might be a simple thing to fix... but we'll need a bit more info from you about your setup to know if this is the issue.\nHigh ping times (more than a couple of milliseconds) will really slow down access to lots of files (which iTunes will be doing when syncing for example). Packet loss will be even worse, as it might mean a stall for well over a second while attempting to access a file.\nSMB Software\n\n\n*\n\n*Are you able to test a similar setup using a Windows or Mac machine instead of the unRAID server (perhaps with reduced total library size)?\n\n*Are you able to compile your own version of samba on your Mac (ideally the same version that your unRAID server uses) and mount using that instead of the built-in samba client? (this one I have no idea how to do, but I'm fairly sure would be possible for an experienced UNIX sysadmin/hacker).\n\n\nBy swapping out the unRAID samba server or the built-in OS X SMB client entirely, you may find that it performs equally badly or \"just works\"... There's every chance that the unRAID server and Mac OS X 10.6.x just don't talk SMB very well together, in which case testing it with a different SMB client/server combination may show improved performance.\nIt's hard to assign fault if that turns out to be the case, because it could be either the client or server end that are technically not doing the right thing, but it's at least something to test... you might be able to permanently change the server or client SMB software on one machine to solve the problem...\niTunes Software\n\n\n*\n\n*Can you test this out on an old version of iTunes? (would require rebuilding the library for that version of course)\n\n\nIf you have access to a machine with an older version of iTunes, you could see if it performs any better... perhaps its just that iTunes can't handle the network-induced lag (which may be at its maximum performance based on your network & SMB server-client setup).\n\nHopefully you have access to some other computer(s) and/or network hardware to do some of these tests, which should shed light on the underlying cause. Even if its a bug at the high level (with iTunes or unRAID or OS X), it may be something you can mitigate by providing a better (faster? more reliable?) network connection between the two computers. In any case, that should give you somewhere to start, and some more information for us to help...\n\nA: There\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand, if you have iTunes on a Mac (OS X 10.6), what does the fact that iTunes is a Package (like mostly every other Cocoa/Mac Application) has to do with the library problems? \niTunes is stored in /Applications, and as such it requires custom permissions so every user on the computer can have the proper access to it. Basically the \u201csystem\u201d is the only one with read/write permission. Other applications may have other permissions, but as long as you have read, there shouldn\u2019t be problems with that. \nI\u2019m not 100% sure about issues with iTunes storing a library in a smb share but there could be issues, not because Apple has (or has not) problems with SMB shares (the code is the same for linux/mac or any other samba client), but because samba (and the Microsoft protocol in general) is really not very good. iTunes may be having problems updating the metadata for the files (when it imports them) and that could be causing problems. \nYou don\u2019t seem to mention what file system is your raid using, because SMB is not a filesystem but a sharing protocol. \n\nA: I've a similar setup, running my iTunes Library over a Lacie Network Space (1Tb).\nI got the same problem, after upgrading to iTunes 10. Seems like that the new versione makes an heavy use of advanced HFS+ properties.\nI solved the issue mounting the drive in AppleTalk mode (AFP). This resolved the slow speed problem, bumping up iTunes and the system.\nBe sure to avoid SMB mounting, since iTunes (and possibly other applications) cannot handle correctly resources.\ncheers\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3850", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

I've tried the normal soft reset, but this doesn't seem to have done anything. Any suggestions?\n\nA: I've had issues with an iPod nano showing most songs with incorrect durations, though in my case they were shown as much longer than the song actually was.\nMy guess is it was caused by encoding the MP3s in a program not called \"iTunes\".  They played great everywhere, but the song length never looked right in iTunes on my Mac, either.  I guess Apple's MP3/ID3 decoder is stricter than my encoder was.\nIf you were using some other program to encode them, you could try re-encoding them in iTunes.\n\nA: Well, if your iTunes library is ok, then you might want to remove all the music from the iPod, re-sync (to make sure it is empty) and then sync again, that ought to copy the music over.\nIf this fails to fix it, then you might want to hard-reset the ipod as something could be bad to the point where a simple resync is not fixing it. \nPlease bear in mind that a reset will erase all the information on the device. You don\u2019t mention if you have WIndows or Mac, but in any case, the process ought to be similar. \nSince the access to the underlying OS of the iPod is limited (by Apple\u2019s design), all you can do is try to erase and sync again. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3851", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: Can I use iPhone earbuds as a microphone on my MacBook? The only microphone I have is the one built-in to my iPhone earbuds. I want to try some line-in stuff, so I plugged the headphones into the microphone port. I then went to System Preferences/Sound/Input and selected Line In. It doesn't appear that this is working as a microphone. Should it?\n\nA: On late 2008 MacBooks and on, iPhone earbuds will function as headphones and a mic if plugged into the headphone port.\n\nA: This depends - do you have separate jacks for headphones & microphone or just one jack? If you have two jacks you'll have to get a splitter for it to work properly.\n\n\nA: In short, the microphone won't work as a microphone the way you're trying it, but the earbuds will.\nLonger answer...\nIn order to use the microphone from your iPhone headphones, they must be plugged into the headphones socket. You can see in the images below that the MacBook Pro \"Sound\" preference pane recognises that they have a microphone and switches the \"Built-in Microphone\" to the headphones one when they're in the headphones socket.\nIf you plug the iPhone headphones into the Mic/Line-in socket, it seems to be only set up for a standard stereo 3.5mm jack, and so will use the earbuds (both of them) as microphones \u2014\u00a0a stereo microphone effectively (though they're not great at picking up sound or well matched to the hardware as microphones, so will require lots of amplification).\nSound preference pane without the headphones plugged in the headphones socket:\n\nSound preference pane with the headphones plugged in the headphones socket:\n\nPlugging the iPhone headphones into the Mic/Line-in socket shows no change (i.e. looks like the top image) and having tested it, only the earbuds seem to produce any response in the computer (i.e. they're connected but the microphone isn't).\n\nA: You can use the microphone on the iPhone earphones (as well as the volume and music forward/next on newer machines). But I think the reason its not working for you is by selecting Line In. What if you keep it as microphone?\n\nA: Apple supports using an \"iPhone\" headset on Macs that display External Microphone in the Built-in Audio section of System Profiler (Also called System Information on newer versions of the OS). \n\nAny computer that displays \"External microphone\" in the System Profiler will work with the Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic.  To confirm that External microphone is in your System Profiler, choose About This Mac from the Apple (\uf8ff) menu and then click More Info.  Select Audio (Built In) under the Hardware section.\n\nThe operation is plug-n-play, the computer will automatically detect the microphone and earphones when you plug in the headset.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3855", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "16"}}

When you sync, it should copy purchased items from your iPod to your Mac. \nIf you have time, back up your iPod: Connect it to iTunes, then right-click (or control-click) and select Back Up.

{"text": "Q: Can I connect more than one external monitor to the late 2010 MacBook Air? I am thinking about buying the new MacBook Air as a primary desktop replacement.  One of the things I have on my desktop which I like is two large monitors.  Does anyone know whether the new MacBook Air can be used to drive more than one external monitor?  Note that I don't want to use the LCD panel on the laptop as one monitor and attach another monitor.  I really am looking for two monitors.  \nCan anyone suggest a trick for doing this native or a third-party device I might be able to purchase which would let me connect two monitors to the third-party device but make them look like a single monitor MacBook Air?  [Dori below makes the good point that this may not be great solution because ideally I would want one monitor with a menu bar on the bottom and another monitor which is functional but no menubar.]\nAny help appreciated.  Thanks.\n\nA: Sidecar is a nice product for windows and they have a Mac version, but seems outdated (and in fact I found the Mac version via Google, not through their product page). You might want to contact them in case they have something not shown there.\nIn any case, the graphic card (and CPU power) in the MBAir will have a \u201chard\u201d time driving \u201ctwo large monitors\u201d. \nIf you still want to try, this guy over here is using not two, but three displays (plus the macbook\u2019s display) for a total of four. He has a Macbook Pro tho.\nHe basically tried the Matrox solution and didn\u2019t like it for various reasons he outlines in the post, so he tried the Diamond BVU195 USB-DVI adapter (he brought two).\nGo ahead and read his post, he posts his impressions, problems and even links where to buy the things and their prices. You will surely need a couple of USB Hubs for that.\nUPDATE: New products are now available for Mac as Matrox Introduces New Mac-Friendly DualHead2Go DP and TripleHead2Go DP Multi-Monitor Adapters.\n\nA: Adding one external display is easy. The interesting part is adding more than just the one external display.\nI recommend the USB 2.0 to DVI Display Adapter from MonoPrice. It supports DVI, VGA, and HDMI, and costs just under $50.\nAnother option is the Diamond BVU195 that @Martin mentioned (list: $90). \nTwo other options are the IOGEAR GUC2020DW6 - USB 2.0 External DVI Video Card and the Diamond BVUMD3 HD USB Display Adapter. They're both around $100 and support DVI and VGA. The latter also includes a 3 port USB hub which I think is a nice addition.\n\nA: A sidestepping \u2013and way cheaper\u2013 solution is to use ScreenRecycler. For just two screens connect one directly to the computer and then use any really old hardware you have lying around (old mac mini are perfect, but a PC or an old laptop will work equally well) to connect the second one. Then follow the instructions on how to use screen recycler.\nThe networked screen will be slower than the directly connected one, slower than USB adaptors. Use the \"quick one\" for games and video and the slow one to park your email/twitter/IM windows.\nFor the people interested in this who have computers with Firewire ports note that you can use the firewire connection to create a dedicated network with the dumb screen driver. This could improve display performance.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3894", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "14"}}
{"text": "Q: How to change the language of the App Store to be able to see accurate star ratings? I have an iTunes account with an Italian billing address; because of this Apple assumes that I want the app store in Italian which is not the case.\nPart of the UI is in Italian (other parts are in English, go figure), the app descriptions and their reviews are in Italian, even the \"Top apps\" are the top apps in Italy instead of worldwide.\nThe biggest problem of all is that there is no way to see the ratings for apps without logging out first. This is a big inconvenience as almost all applications show up as having \"no ratings\" (as only local ratings and reviews are shown, which are very few and almost non existent).\nThis of course severely hinders my capability of knowing whether an app is good or not. Even the most popular apps have either 0 ratings or less than 5.\nAs an example, YNAB which currently has 1574 ratings when viewed from the English store shows up as \"No Ratings\" while I am logged in.\nIs there any way to change the language to English, and see worldwide ratings without having to log out first?\nEDIT: 6 years later, there appears to be still no solution.\nEDIT 2: 10 years later, I just went to the US and opened a Wells Fargo account, and changed the credit card to that.

All the pages with occurrences of \"C++\" will then be presented first.\n\nA: You could just open the PDF in Safari.

Preview used to behave this way, but somewhere around OS X 10.5, Apple tried to make it smarter, e.g., looking for pages that contain some or all of the words you type, instead of treating your words as a phrase. This new behavior in Preview is much less useful to me, but I don't know any way to turn it off. You can partly get around it by putting quotes around phrases, but I haven't found any way to get Preview to search for symbols, e.g., \"C++\".\n\nA: Use Google Chrome's built-in pdf renderer.

{"text": "Q: How well does VirtualBox perform when compared to VMWare Fusion for Linux guests? I'm looking to do some Linux development, which includes some live testing of my application. I need pretty decent performance, but maybe not pedal to the metal performance, at least not for testing. However, I don't want a VM that is going to drag me down, or use more of my Mac's resources than needed. How well does VirtualBox perform on Snow Leopard?\n\nA: Having extensively used VMware Fusion (all the versions from 1 beta till 3.1), Parallels (from their first public release till 5.x -haven\u2019t yet upgraded to 6) and a lot of VirtualBox versions (Although I stopped using it six months ago), I can say that for Windows both Parallels and VMware ran circles around VirtualBox in terms of features, compatibility and speed. \nI used to compile .NET code inside those Windows and the speed of VMware and Parallels was superior (I went ahead and clocked different timings).\nVirtualBox\u2019s advantage was (and still is) price. For a lot of stuff VirtualBox is enough, but it\u2019s still (as far as I understand) slower than its two (only) competitors. \nThe advantage you have is that VirtualBox is free, so you can start trying it now, and both VMware and Parallels offer trial versions you can try. If you\u2019re serious about finding the best virtualization solution for your scenario, I suggest you take the appropriate time to test all three options yourself. \nI\u2019m personally using Parallels 5 these months, because it worked better than VMware 3.1 for my Visual Studio C# very big solution. However, I\u2019ve used VMware and skipped Parallels 3 and 4 because they were more unstable and slow (for me). \nI didn\u2019t want to upgrade to Parallels 6 because they annoy me with their $49 upgrade price that you have to pay every year. \n\nA: I cannot compare to VMWare, but VirtualBox and Linux work just fine on my laptop. I run computationally expensive code on the Linux VM. It only has 1 CPU whereas the laptop is Core 2 Duo. The laptop has 8GB RAM and the VM gets 2 of those.\nOne slight performance improvement is to boot the VM headlessly, then ssh in, if your application isn't a GUI.\n\nA: I run Ubuntu Desktop 10.10 as a guest in VirtualBox Mac, and can say that it runs about as fast as when I ran it in Fusion. It is definitely slower that in Fusion for things that open a lot of files (such as recompiling the kernel), but in the same range for normal desktop Linux use, at least in my case.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3922", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}

Should I just go with Leopard instead of Snow Leopard?\n\nA: Check to make sure you have enough RAM, Snow Leopard requires 1GB of RAM.  Snow Leopard does not require a 64-bit processor.\n\nA: What install DVD are you using?  If it's one that shipped with a Mac (as opposed one sold separately), it's probably locked to only install on the specific model it was included with.\n\nA: This error is very confusing. Time by time I face this problem because I mostly forget this \nsolution. I recenlty had this issue with an old iMac G4. It ended up the following way.\nAfter partitioning the volume, you have to click Erase and change the partition type from \nDOS to Mac OSX journaled. I hope this will help everybody there because no one in most of \nthe solutions forums point to these steps. This solution might also work for newer Mac computers.\n\nA: It may also be because your old drive is not partitioned in the correct way. You might have to reformat the DRIVE with the GUID option ticked. The GUID option will appear in Disk Utility ONLY when you choose to reformat the internal drive. \nAsk (or google) if you need more info about this.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3952", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}
{"text": "Q: iPad VGA output for the iPod app? I'm trying to get an iPad to play a video playlist through the VGA output cable. The only way I know of to play a video playlist is through the iPod app. The problem, is that the iPod  app doesn't output the video through the VGA cable. \nIs there any way to get it to output correctly? Or is there another way to play the video playlist?\n\nA: I would just look in the app store for a video playback app that supports VGA output. Lots of them do now.\nYou don't need to jailbreak your phone.\nHere is an app called \"StreamToMe\" that supports playback of your videos over 3G and Wi-Fi and has VGA output.\nStreamToMe: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/streamtome/id325327899?mt=8#\n\nA: The App developer needs to add that API to there App. So as of now if you want to output the video through VGA you will need to jail break you iPod or find an app that supports video out through the dock connector.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3954", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}
{"text": "Q: Is it possible to save http-hosted MP3 files directly onto an iPad? Is there a way to save an MP3 from a web server directly onto an iPad?  I can stream it through the browser, but there is no obvious \"save\" capability.  \nWould it make a difference if the MP3 were an email attachment?\n\nA: As fas as I know there is no way to save an MP3 file directly from the web. What you can do is jailbreak your iPad and then try saving it. \n\nA: Here's a roundabout way of doing it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Drobox account and install the Drobox app on your Mac and\niPhone.\n\n*Use http://urldroplet.com/ to save the mp3 to your Drobox account.\n\n*Open Drobox on your iPhone, you can star it so it's downloaded and kept for offline access. \n\n\nA: You could save it into an app, such as AirSharing, then use iTunes to save the file to your computer, then put it into the Music Library like normal.\nThere is unfortunately no direct way to get a file contained somewhere on the Web, or even in an app, into the music library/video library, without first using iTunes.\nSame goes for having it e-mailed to you. You can always access the e-mail and re-stream the MP3, but note the emphasis on that. Continually Stream the MP3.\nYou must use iTunes to get it into your library without any other significant process, such as Jailbreak as noted by Chirag.\n\nA: GoodReader is what you're looking for. Copy the URL into it or use the built in browser to find the file you want then download it.\n\nA: It is possible, by jailbreaking the iPad and then installing a tweak called Safari Download Manager. This will allow you to save any file from Safari to your iPad.\n\nA: My favorite is Documents by Readdle. It has a builtin browser.\nYou can simply browse your desired webpage and download different kinds of files like mp3, pdf and others into your iPad directly and enjoy playing or reading them in the same application.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3955", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "26"}}

{"text": "Q: Why is my mid-2010 MacBook Pro experiencing a blank blue screen and crashing? I've had this happen a couple of times so far, not sure what's happening. I think it's related to having an external monitor connected to the notebook.\nMy regular workflow is to have the MBP log out in the morning so TimeMachine will back up my FileVaulted home directory. I disconnect everything (USB hub, external monitor, power) and tell the MBP to sleep, then close the lid.\nI use the system during the day and when I get home reconnect the USB and external display.\nTwice in a few weeks I have had the display on the external LCD go white and the built-in display go completely blue, no kernel panic, no displayed errors, nothing. I am forced to power it off by holding the power button and then boot it back up.\nLast night it did it to me. It had my email/web browser open and I sat down, touched the mouse, and the displays just jumped to solid white and the built-in to solid blue.\nThe last time I remember this happening I had Spaces enabled, and thinking there was an issue with the external monitor connected with Spaces enabled (I think the crash happened after the MBP went to sleep overnight, connected to power, and I woke it in the morning to have it go kerplooey) I disabled Spaces and it seemed to be more stable, as I didn't remember it happening for quite awhile.\nI opened the window server logs for the time of the crash and only found this (reboot was near 7:15 PM):\n\nNov 11 16:58:16 [919] kCGErrorFailure: CGXDisableUpdate: UI updates were forcibly disabled by application \"SystemUIServer\" for over 1 second.

{"text": "Q: How can I disable the 2nd hard drive in my 27\" iMac? I have an 2010 27\" iMac with an SSD and a regular hard drive. Now that I've been using the machine for some time and have not come close to filling the SSD, I'd like to disable the spinning hard drive completely. Why? It makes a loud humming sound when it runs, and I don't use it for anything. Anything I can do short of taking apart this monster and ripping it out?\nUPDATE: As of 3-Apr-2012 and OS X 10.7.3, the solution below works. Some programs occasionally spin up the drive, but it only hums for about 5 minutes then goes back to sleep.\n\nA: I don't know if it'll work, but try going into the Energy Saver section of System Preferences and select \"Put hard disk(s) to sleep whenever possible\". Then go into Disk Utility and unmount the hard drive. With no way to access the drive, I would assume Mac OS X would put the drive to sleep.\nThis is a temporary solution though, and it won't persist across reboots (Mac OS X automatically mounts all available drives at boot). If you're really not using the drive and don't have any data on there that you want, my suggestion would be to go into Disk Utility, repartition the drive, and for the format select \"Free Space\". Once done, Mac OS X will be unable to mount the drive and should put it to sleep.\n\nA: The best solution is go to Apple service and ask them to remove the drive. I am also not happy with this issue, and I have a Hitachi 2 TB HDD which has a loud humming at idle. Which HDD model do you have, just curious? I was thinking about installing a quieter HDD, but there are some hardware compatibility problems and iMacs are problematic to open. It's sad Apple does not care about the HDD hum. \nBTW it's actually easy to use an Apple script or a simple Cocoa app to unmount the drive on startup - which should use a shell script below\ndiskutil unmountDrive \"drivename\"\n\nYou can also reduce the time before sleep to 1 min from default 10 mins via Terminal command:\nsudo pmset -a disksleep 1\n\nBut that does not solve the problem completely. Also some apps are accessing the drive even when unmounted, Parallels background agent does that for some reason. \n\nA: I'd also recommend you try to use my util to auto disable your second drive on booting OS with an opportunity to enable it in one command whenever after.

When I hover over the empty spots, I can see the names of the apps and launch them normally. \nAnd here's one of the app switcher (it was kind of challenging to take this with cmd-shift-3, btw):\n\nI don't remember doing anything special to make OS X lose the icons.\nAt first I thought it was some temporary glitch, but logging out & back in didn't help, and neither did rebooting the machine. \nUpgrade from 10.6.4 to 10.6.5 didn't improve the situation either. Anyone have ideas how I could fix this?\n\nA: If restarting and all that doesn't help, here's how i fixed mine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open finder.\n\n*Go to /Applications.\n\n*Drag the offending application to the desktop to create a shortcut.\n\n*Shortcut should have the proper icon.\n\n*Right click shortcut and click on Get info.\n\n*Click on the icon on the top left of the info view. Example:\n\n\n*When icon is selected (blue highlight), hit Cmd+C to copy it. Example:\n\n\n*Delete shortcut (not necessary).\n\n*Go back to /Applications in finder.\n\n*Right click on the offending application.\n\n*Click Get info.\n\n*Notice the place where the icon should be Top left.\n\n*Click on that location to highlight it.\n\n*Press Cmd+V\n\n\nYou should now see your icon again.\nTip: This method can also be used to change any icon to something else and customise your Mac !\n\nA: For me, the problem was with Terminal.app. It was an app I had set to \"Keep in dock\".  What happened was the icon for Terminal.app started displaying on the dock and in the Cmd-Tab panel as the default icon:\n\nWhat I had to do to get the original icon back was, while the app was opened, right click on the dock icon and select \"Options -> Keep in Dock\" and remove the checkmark, then I followed the same procedure selecting \"Keep in Dock\" again to get the checkmark back.\n\nAfter that, I got the familiar Terminal icon back.\n\nA: Strange. I've had this problem for a while, but now immediately after I asked about it publicly, it seems to fix itself. Re-launching the apps brought the icons back. \nWell, I guess this is because I hadn't logged out or rebooted before this for a long time. Logout and/or reboot + relauching each app (once or twice?) was most likely what fixed this.\nThanks and sorry.\nEdit: Maybe I was too hasty. One of the icons, that of Spotify, is still missing, no matter how many times I try to relaunch the app. \nEdit 2: I got Spotify icon back too, by removing the app from Dock and then adding it back. Now everything on the Dock looks okay again.\n\nA: You have self answered your question real fast, however, for the record, these are the steps you need to perform in case it reappears:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logoff/Logon. Reboot if necessary. If it doesn\u2019t fix it, continue.\n\n*Make a backup, trash the Dock DB and Preferences (*)\n\n*Kill the Dock (open Terminal: /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and execute: killall Dock\n\n\nThe above statement (killall Dock) is case sensitive so make sure you put Dock with the \u2018D\u2019 in uppercase. \nwarning: Thrashing the above files, will reset your dock and you will likely lose the icons you have (which you will have to happily re-drag and re-arrange), so take a screenshot before all that ;)\nAs a final solution, try an utility like Cocktail (not free) or any of the free alternatives like Onyx and clear your caches, rebuild your locate dbs, etc. It\u2019s not bad to do that from time to time, especially if you don\u2019t leave your computer on everynight where it can perform all the maintenance. \n(*) Located in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist and com.apple.dock.db\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3981", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

{"text": "Q: Is Mac Pro Airport Extreme simultaneous dual-band? Can the Airport Extreme in a Mac Pro be used to create a network that is simultaneously dual-band such as the Airport Extreme base station?\nThe Mac Pro is a 5,1 with the AirPort Extreme  (0x14E4, 0x8E) card in it using the \nBroadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (5.10.131.36.1) firmware.\n\nA: I\u2019m 90% (I leave that 10% just in case) ;), that the Wi-Fi card that ships with a Mac Pro\u2019s is not capable of sharing the ethernet connection (that connects to Internet) over the Wi-Fi in dual band mode. The reason for this is that the very same Airport Express is not able to do that (and it\u2019s a dedicated piece of hardware). You can infer that from two things: \n\n\n*\n\n*It\u2019s not mentioned in Apple\u2019s website that the Airport Express (or Mac Pro) have simultaneous dual band, which would be required for what you want. \n\n*It is mentioned that (and I quote): \u201cSpeed and range will be less if an 802.11a/b/g product joins the network\u201d. That means, that although they can use either 2.4Ghz or 5.0Ghz, they cannot use both at the same time, and when a slower 2.4 device (using a/b/g) joins, the antenna must switch to that speed, because they only have one antenna. \nThe Airport Base Station (Airport Extreme), on the other hand, mentions that in the very front page: \u201cAirPort Extreme operates in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands simultaneously and offers even better performance and range.\u201d. Seeing is believing ;)\nSo the answer to your question is: No, the Airport Extreme card on a Mac Pro (or any other Wi-Fi Mac Computer for the matter) as of November 2010, is not capable of using a Wi-Fi connection in simultaneous dual-band; not for sharing, not as a client either.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3984", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: How does the volume control work on my iPod touch? OK, I'm going to sound like an idiot for asking this, but...\nHow's the volume control work on an iPod Touch (iOS 4)?  I always seem to surprise myself when I discover that the volume is up when I assume it's down, or vice versa.\nI've owned (pre-iOS) iPod, and they were easy: there's one volume setting.  For the iPod Touch, having a speaker, running \"OS X\", and using the Mac OS X semi-transparent gray volume icon overlay, I figured it'd be just like my Mac.  That is, two separate volume settings, one for the speaker and one for the headphones, and it uses the correct one depending on whether there's something plugged in.\nAfter a while, I found that it doesn't work this way.  I can't figure out quite how it works, though.  One thought was that maybe the volume control is per-app, but that doesn't seem to always be true, either.  Or is it per-app and per-headphones/speaker?\nAnother aspect that confuses me: when setting the volume, sometimes I get the Mac-style gray icon overlay, and sometimes it uses a round slider in the app itself.  It doesn't seem to be just the app: sometimes the YouTube app shows the gray overlay, even when its own slider is visible!  Is this visual distinction supposed to be useful to me?  It seems like it might be, but I haven't figured out the pattern yet.\nCan anyone explain to me how this is supposed to work?  Or is there any official documentation on how the volume controls work?\nI'm so confused...\nEDIT: Example: I go to Flashcards, set the volume to 0%.  Go to home screen, set volume=50% (up from 25%).  Go to Youtube, set volume=25%.  Start playing a video, it shows volume=0% now (why?), so I turn it up to 25%.  Exit, go back to Flashcards, volume here is now 25% (why?).  (This is all with no headphones plugged in -- I'd like to understand the simple case before I even try to figure out how headphone volume works!)\nIt's obviously not simply a per-app setting: I've never set the volume in Flashcards to be anything other than 0%, yet it keeps getting turned up, in this case to the volume I set in Youtube.  But the Youtube volume isn't a global setting, either, since I set the volume on the home screen, and Youtube showed me 2 different volume settings (depending on whether a video was playing), and neither of them used that setting.\nMy next theory was that there's a \"shared app volume\" setting that was used by Flashcards and Youtube-but-only-when-not-playing-video (but not by the home screen, which is silly, since the home screen doesn't have any sound).  So I tried setting the volume in Youtube-not-playing-video and going back to Flashcards ... nope, in this direction the Flashcards volume stays the same.\nMy latest theory is that Youtube-not-playing-video can set the shared-app-volume, and Youtube-playing-video will read the shared-app-volume, and Flashcards will both set and read this volume.  (And Youtube itself has 2 volume settings, neither of which is the same as the one I set on the home screen, so I always have to just set the Youtube volume twice.  And double this if I decide to plug in headphones.)\nThis is the simplest theory I've found to explain most of what I'm seeing, but it seems completely insane.  If anybody has a way to explain this that doesn't involve epicycles, I'd love to hear it.\n\nA: You\u2019re technically right. There are two settings, one for the speaker, one for the headphones. Both volumes are independent; if you have volume low on speaker and connect a headphone, you\u2019re going to get the headphone volume, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to adjust until you disconnect it. \nNow, applications can alter the device\u2019s volume, but they can also have their own independent volume level. For example a game might have a volume setting and if you put it all the way down, the ipod\u2019s volume (alarms, music, etc.) is not altered. As far as I can remember (should check the latest iOS SDK) that is possible. \nApplications can of course mute themselves without altering the device\u2019s settings. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4010", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

Querying the last modified time would help a lot in security.\nEDIT:  Simply for reference.  \n mdutil -pEsa -i (on|off) volume ...\n    Utility to manage Spotlight indexes.\n    -p      Publish metadata.\n    -i (on|off) Turn indexing on or off.\n    -E      Erase and rebuild index.\n    -s      Print indexing status.\n    -a      Apply command to all volumes.\n    -v      Display verbose information.\nNOTE: Run as owner for network homes, otherwise run as root.\n\nEDIT:  Upon further investigation, the tool I wanted was radmind\n\nA: From a great deal of research, and looking around, I have some data on this issue:\nBy default, spotlight will not index certain folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*/System   \n\n*/usr\n\n*hidden files or directories.   \n\n*Other user files.\n\n\nTo add a file path to spotlight you can run \nmdimport -r /path  \n\nman mdimport \n\nhas the information on that.  \nNow, since I am aiming for a poor mans IDS out of all this stuff, this desire being driven by the knowledge that Spotlight indexes my drive all  the time, which is what would happen anyway with other host based IDS there were some  considerations and other tools to involve.\nConsiderations:\nSpotlight will only show you what your user should see \nThat's what the documentation says. I can  see stuff I installed as root, but I can't see my other user.  However,I can see /usr /usr/libexec and the /System tree.  That'll do.\nHidden files and folders do not show up in the search \nThis will be good when the RIAA remotely scans your drives for music without proper credentials ( Trust your feelings you know this to be true. ) but is not the greatest news in this case.\nTo conclude, there is a lot of stuff to do to use this tool effectively.  The secret is that Apple signs everything digitally. \nman codesign\n\nwill tell you about \ncodesign -v file\n\nwhich should return nothing if the file is unmodified.  Note that this is not a checksum but a digital certificate from Apple, so only big money will allow this to be faked.\nI of course meant to say that it will be quite secure, and easily detectable if a binary program is changed.  \nWon't stop everything, but it will allow me to periodically bark \n\"Did anything just change?\" , run a spotlight search on the \"kMDItemKind\" attribute , pipe it through codesign -v and see if something did change, or search on modification time or whatever.\nTo address the userland statement above, I can check to see I have the same spotlight ( I have copied codesign to my recovery media. ) intact spotlight means that I can trust it to do it's ordinary tasks. Using the mdimport -r /path is indeed a better idea, since that will exit if run as root.  \nCertainly there is a question of security here, but as mentioned above, spotlight indexes a bunch of things, and shows you what you should see.  Your little sister will not be able to find your collection of late 1990 artistic nudes, nor will you be able to find her secrets, but root should be able to see everything.  There is a straightforward system of authorizations in OS X that govern which right a program can have, but since this is virtually unknown to most, they simply type in a password when a box comes up to authenticate something they have downloaded, and it installs as root.  A certain search engines software does exactly this.  Hell, the system is actually more secure than before, I ran the old python importer, and it failed, because it asked for my admin password and tried to run mdimport -r as root!  I had to run it myself.\n(Oh it's very nice with the python files, lovely really) \nHope this helps somebody else.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4042", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}
{"text": "Q: Where are the good docs? I have been reading the OSX security pdf from the apple site, it describes how to ensure Snow Leopard can be brought up to the Common Compliance standard.\nEntirely different than the diffident documentation available from  the \"help\" system. \nI love it. What I don't love however, is the degree to which I had become complacent, treating the laptop as a secured place with a great UI to do my work.  I found out today, for example, that Spotlight seems to not index /System, which is lunacy, that is the most important place to keep an eye on files!\nWhere is detailed documentation like this pdf available for the core system?  \nEDIT:  Am I asking on the wrong site of the increasingly fragmented stack empire?  There is no tag for 'documentation', or 'howto'?\nEDIT:  Found them.  Developer tools, \ncom.apple.adc.documentation.AppleSnowLeopard.CoreReference.docset\nThat's the goodstuff.  How to master the system, not just play with it.\n\nA: I believe that you\u2019re not asking in the wrong place, you\u2019re really not asking a question. What you define like \u201cThe Good Docs\u201d is completely subjective. The guide you linked clearly says: \n\nImportant: This document is intended for use by security\n  professionals in sensitive\n  environments. Implementing the\n  techniques and settings found in this\n  document impacts system functionality\n  and may not be appropriate for every\n  user or environment.\nIf you\u2019re using this guide, you\n  should be an experienced Mac OS X\n  user, be familiar with the Mac OS X\n  user interface, and have experience\n  using the Terminal application\u2019s\n  command-line interface. You should\n  also be familiar with basic networking\n  concepts. Some instructions in this\n  guide are complex, and use could cause\n  serious effects on the computer and\n  its security. These instructions\n  should only be used by experienced Mac\n  OS X users, and should be followed by\n  thorough testing.\n\nSo clearly these \u201cgood\u201d documents are not that good for everybody. In any case,\nSpotlight doesn\u2019t index /System because that could be a security problem on its own (it would need permissions to do that, a set of permissions that you don\u2019t want to give to a userland daemon running all the time, with access to a UI). Why would a regular user want to keep an index of /System remains a mystery to me, it only has things that are for the System and not for the user to find and manipulate. \nYou can, however, use the terminal to touch that if that\u2019s what you want, but no user should ever attempt to land in /System, it can only break so many things\u2026\nWhere did you get the idea that \n\n\n*\n\n*/System is the most important place to keep an eye on files ?\n\n*Spotlight is a tool to keep an eye on files?\n\n\nThe place to keep an eye on files is in your very own /Users/YourFolder, because that\u2019s all the access you should have (to write that is).\nSpotlight is an indexing/searching tool, not a tool to monitor files that may seem suspicious in reserved system places. \nAll in all, if you still want those docs, I\u2019m sure that most of them will be available in the developer\u2019s area of Apple\u2019s website.  (developer.apple.com). You can create a free account and start from there. \nOn the other hand, if you are a \u201csecurity professional\u201d then you are using the wrong tools for your job. Spotlight is ok as it is, if anything, you might want to restrict it. I\u2019m sure that if you make spotlight run as root it will eventually index that, but of all the possible ideas that come to my mind, that is probably one of the worst security ideas ever conceived. There\u2019s a reason why root user is disabled by default, there\u2019s a reason for sudo and there\u2019s a reason for normal accounts.

{"text": "Q: Why is my MacBook Pro constantly losing the wifi connection with my WRT150N router? My Macbook is constantly losing its wifi connection. Sometimes it has trouble connecting, other times it connects, but I obtain a server not found error. It seems to work reasonably well at work, but it can't obtain a connection at home even when I am extremely close to the router. Until recently, I used to only have wifi connection problems occasionally. My android phone seems to be able to connect to wifi without problem.\n\nA: If you are certain that your Wi-Fi connection works fine when you are somewhere else, there might be signal or compatibility problems between your router and your Macbook Pro. Contrary to popular belief, wi-fi connections are not a voodoo thing, and they just involve radio waves, just like a cellphone and any other wireless device. \nReasons for a Wi-Fi connection being lost could be quite a lot, but usually interference and signal noise are the two primary factors. Where some devices are able to \u201cmaintain\u201d the connection (despite the possible errors), others simply fail and drop it more often. \nWi-Fi is designed to continue working despite \u201csmall interruptions\u201d (albeit with a decrease in performance due to \u2018retries\u2019), but sometimes this is not possible and connections get dropped. \nSometimes the problem relies in the encryption. When the network is not open and it\u2019s traffic is encrypted, this \u201coverhead\u201d causes more drops than the usual.\nPossible solutions are resetting the router to factory settings and reconfiguring it, changing the channel from Auto to something allowed in your country, making sure your Operating system / Computer has the latest drivers/patches/etc. and there isn\u2019t really much else you can do.\nYou can try moving your router to another physical position.\nI\u2019ve read a few posts about that specific router model and Macbooks having problems, so also assume there might be a problem with that model (or some revision of the router) and OS X.\nYou can always try to see if the Console has some relevant error messages (/Applications/Utilities/Console.app).\n\nA: Try using iStumbler to detect and identify neighboring and overlapping wireless access points (WAPs).  It's likely an interference issue that can be solved with vigilance.  You need to find out what channels your neighbor's WAPs are using, and then switch your router to use the least crowded channel you can find.\nIdeally you want to use channels 1, 6, or 11.  These are the channels that have the most leeway when it comes to other channels interfering with their signal.  Wifi devices operating on a particular channel can interfere with other devices operating on channels up to 5 steps away.  The amount of interference grows logarithmically with signal strength and channel proximity.  \nFor example, if you are using channel 1 and your nearest neighboring wireless network is also using channel 1, you are receiving a large amount of interference.  If you are on 1 and the other network is on 6, the interference is negligible.  However, if you are on channel 1 and your neighbor is using channel 3, you are likely still on the receiving end of a huge amount of interference depending on their WAPs signal strength.\niStumbler will give you information about the signal strengths emanating from the other interfering WAPs, and from there you can infer the best channel to use.  You may need to periodically perform the same task as your neighbors change their wifi channels.\n\nA: I also have the same issues but with WRT160N.. I will try to reset it to factory settings and will test it again.\n@Martin Thanks for the answer, I have one Q. I setup my router when I had a Windows Laptop, then I moved to new place and bought MacBook.

{"text": "Q: Simple way to see a list of installed iOS apps with their storage space size? The storage on my iPhone is nearly full. Most of the space is used by apps. I'd like to see which apps consume the most space on my device.\nIs there a way to get a list of the apps with their corresponding used space? By \"used space I mean the installation size (bonus for added user data).\n\nA: iTunes will give you the list of apps you have including size (and can order these by size to make the space hogs apparent). Unfortunately it will not show you the user data size, nor will it just show you the installed apps\n\nA: You can get both the app size as well as that of the data it stores without jailbreaking by using the free application iPhone Explorer (Mac and PC). For data you'll want to open the app folder and then look in its Documents and Library folders (primarily... there may be some data stored in tmp as well, but it never gets backed up and the device will empty it automatically when it needs space).  \n\n\nA: iOS 5 has now introduced a new feature under Settings > General > Usage that perfectly displays the amount of data taken up by every app on the device, sorted by top offenders.\n\nA: You can also see it in itunes when your iPhone or Ipad is connected on the apps tab\nThere you can sort on size.\nThis is easier as you can see if the app is installed on the device or only available in itunes.\nYou can also remove the installed check box, so at the end of the list Sync and its all sorted\n\nA: I managed to get a in-depth view of what is using storage space, but it's really non-trivial to do.\nBasically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Jailbreak Device\n\n\nThen:\neither:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Install iOS SMB server (You have to add an additional Repo to Cydia - It's Here)\n\n*Mount iOS device on desktop over SMB  \n\n\nor: \n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase iFile, which has a WebDAV server built into it.\n\n*Run WebDAV server on iDevice\n\n*Mount WebDAV server on desktop. I did it on windows using NetDrive. I'm not sure what to use on OS X\n\n\nFinally:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Run a disk space visualization tool on the mounted filesystem. I use Disk Inventory X on OS X and WinDirStat on Windows.\n\n\nUnfortunately, for some bizarre reason, all applications are in folders named using GUIDs, rather than the software name, so you have to actually explore large folders to figure out what app the folder contains. Fortunately, it's generally pretty obvious what the app is, since come of the subfolders seem to have to be the app name.\nAlternatively, iFile automatically cross-references the app name with the folder name for you, so you can determine what each folder is using ifile as well.\n\nOn the whole, if all you need to do is see what apps are taking up what, it's probably not worth the effort. On the other hand, if you have already jailbroken (Which you should do anyways - it gives access to many great utilities), it's fairly simple to do.\nAlso, iFile is probably one of the most useful apps for an iOS device. I highly recommend it.\n\nA: FYI, using iTunes as described above doesn't work if you don't keep your apps in iTunes! I stopped doing that long ago, after I realized how much space they were taking up on my Mac.\nSince you can always download an app later, I didn't see any reason to take up all that space on my Mac.\nI hope this info helps anyone like me who doesn't actually have all their apps on their computer.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4048", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "30"}}

{"text": "Q: Can iPhone 4 use GPS when out of cell tower range? There seems to be some dispute on whether the iPhone can still get a GPS signal when out of cell tower range, see this archived Apple support thread, for example.\nI had a friend out in the woods hunting this weekend, and he said that he couldn't get a location via gps, it was just giving errors.\nDoes this depend on how the app is coded? Are there specific location-aware mapping apps (like the built-in maps tool) that someone can firm either do or don't work properly with no wireless signal?\nUpdate: I guess its kind of obvious that it entirely depends on how the app is designed. The built-in maps app tries to download map tiles from the internet, and won't be able to do that, so that probably explains his errors.\nSo my underlying question really is: If I'm going camping, do I need to buy a dedicated \"wilderness\" GPS like one of these? Or is there an iPhone app that can do the same things when away from a wireless/cell signal? \n\nA: This summer I took some photos out of cell range and they were all geotagged so it's definitely possible to use GPS out of cell range, but some apps (like the Maps app) use a data connection to get map tiles and routing data, so those features wouldn't work if you're not in range of either cellular data or wifi.\n\nA: Some of the GPS applications like Tom-Tom or Navigon store the data on the phone and will work without any data signal.  However, they're optimized highly for roads and may not help in the wilderness. Also the dedicated \"wilderness\" GPS might manage better battery life, the iphone doesn't last long when running the GPS in my experience.\n\nA: I browsed the \"Navigation\" category on the app store, and \"MotionX GPS\" and \"GPS Kit\" are two of the popular apps that claim to support this kind of use, including offline downloading of map packs. (Anyone have any experience with these apps?)\nSo it appears that this is at least hypothetically possible using the iPhone hardware. Obviously, battery life for an extended trip could be an issue.\n\nA: Yes, GPS still works, but that only helps if you preload a map\nKnowing where you are by GPS depends on your phone being able to see the satellite signals; cell towers are irrelevant. GPS signals can be blocked by tall objects (so might not work in a ravine or between tall buildings) and possibly in dense tree cover.\nBeing able to download a map while on the move depends on being connected to WiFi or the phone network so you won't be able to do that if you are far from a cell tower. But some apps (I have RouteBuddy atlas) allow you to download full maps to the phone before you travel so they can still tell you where you are when you are otherwise out of contact. \nGPS is much more accurate that cell tower location but is also slower. Celltower approximate location speeds up the GPS but doesn't make it more accurate.\n\nA: Most phones use the cell network to get a rough a idea of where you are (I say rough, but really it cuts it down to a tiny area compared to the size of the Earth aka the coverage of GPS) then use GPS to get the exact location. So if your out of cell range it can take something like up to 20 minutes to get the location (although that was on a Samsung phone and I noticed the iPhone is faster at GPS anyway)\nThe Apps have a accuracy setting so it's possible that if the accuracy is not accurate enough to use GPS it won't find your location, however I would've thought it would find your location with GPS once it realizes there's no data connection.\nTurning my iPhone onto AirPlane mode (effectively taking it out of range of any data connection) and then going onto the default maps app and finding my location takes a while, and switching app while it takes this long makes it timeout.\n\nA: Provided the Location Services are enabled on the phone, GPS will always be able to be used for locating your phone.\nOutside of connectable cell tower and wifi range you'll be limited to GPS accuracy (approx 50 to 100 metres) because you won't have internet access for your phone to find out where the towers/wifi access points are to improve your position accuracy (down to say 10 metres).\nThe problem your friend had is they were in the woods, but GPS is line of sight only. When you're inside (and not next to a window) your phone is only using cell towers and wifi to locate itself, likewise when you're under trees or otherwise cannot see the sky, you lose the GPS signals.\nGPS signals are very easily reflected by buildings, trees, etc, so in a city with buildings all around you or with trees or mountains around you, you may either lose sight of the GPS satellites or receive signals that have bounced off nearby buildings/mountains/etc which will be misleading/confusing for the GPS locator in the phone. In such cases, it either won't give you a location, or may give you the incorrect location due to what is called \"multipath\" error in GPS (i.e. the signal hasn't just travelled directly to you like the algorithm assumes).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4053", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}

If I x the file, ls -a does not show them. What are they?\n\nA: They're resource forks. The Mac's filesystem supports multiple forks, and some Mac files have two, a data fork and a resource fork. Most file systems don't support multiple forks, so tools will split the resource fork into a separate file prefixed with ._.\n\nA: I think you'll find that those files (or directories) came packaged within the .tar.gz file.  Not normal, but any file can go into a tar.\n\nA: Behaviour\nFor the sake of clarity about the issue, the following MWE illustrates what is happening:\ncas$ tar --version\nbsdtar 2.6.2 - libarchive 2.6.2\ncas$ mkdir o\ncas$ touch o/a o/b\ncas$ tar cv o > /dev/null\na ./._o\na o\na o/._a\na o/a\na o/._b\na o/b\n\nSo each file and directory has a ._ file added to the tar file in the same directory, as mipadi said.  This tar, let's call it mactar, avoids collisions by ignoring files beginning ._ in the input, e.g, with:\nmkdir p && touch p/._a p/._b\ncas$ tar cv p p/._b > /dev/null\na ./._p\na p\n\nthe existence of the p/._a file is simply ignored by tar, and so is the p/._b file, even though that is explicitly included in the CLI invocation.  Thus, no collisions can occur.\nControlling tar\nIf you have a Unix background, you likely are unhappy about this behaviour.  The mactar lacks the expected documentation: the man page is for the regular Free BSD tar and does not mention this idiosyncrasy.\nHowever, the generation of the files for the meta forks can be disabled by setting an environment variable, so: export COPYFILE_DISABLE=true.\nHistory\nI'm not quite clear on the timing, but OSX began with the regular Free BSD tar, then Apple circulated an additional utility, tar_hfs that was the ancestor of mactar, and then, I think with Leopard, changed /usr/bin/tar to be mactar.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4056", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: iPod Touch Updates Since I've upgraded from an iPod classic to a Touch, I've had a number of times when I've synced with iTunes and tracks have not been correctly updated, that is, they have not been marked as played that day, even when they have been played (all the way through).\nFurther, I've downloaded some tracks from a course on iTunesU, but they do not show in the playlist on my iPod Touch (despite being in the playlist on iTunes).\nI'm running iTunes 10.10.54 and 4.1 of the firmware.  Does anyone know if either of these are known issues, or has anyone experienced similar issues.\n\nA: I have been asking the same question in other forums about resetting play counts when syncing.\nOne of the strong theories is that it is an iTunes bug caused when you recreate your library in iTunes 10 from a previous iTunes 9 file (which is what I did).  Unfortunately though there is no obvious solution yet.\nI have tried to solve to problem by installing a fresh copy of iTunes 9 on a separate PC and importing my existing library via the iTunes Music Library.xml file.\nUnfortunately the trick for recreating the library by using the XML does not seem backwards compatible.

Also, if they're videos, look for a Video Playlists section under Videos. That might let you play them from that playlist.\nThe reason you may have to do this: Apple wants to allow you to watch music videos/iTunes U videos without the video. This makes more sense for music videos: You get the song, and they video. You can  play the song without draining the battery from the video.\n\nA: It's generally a good idea to run the latest version of iOS unless you're a jailbreaker.\nTo check out iTunesU content, go into the iPod or Music app and select \"More\" on the bottom right-hand corner. iTunes U should be in that list.\n(Why do people say right-hand, not just right?

{"text": "Q: Caps lock key response delay on Apple Wireless Keyboard I've noticed a semi-handy feature on Apple Wireless Keyboard: quick pressing the caps lock key won't enable the caps lock, it needs a determined push. Benefits are obvious, it prevents accidental all-caps text when you actuALLY INTENDED TO PRESS 'A'.\nIs there a way to hack this around? Adjust it or remove it completely? I like the idea, but for me it is more of a speed bump than a seat belt.\nI have checked the keyboard preferences and the usability preferences as well. Keyboard delay is off and repeat delay is at minimum. There are no delay on other keys (well, except the eject key, but it requires even more determined press), and there is no delay when turning the caps lock off.\nI'm on a Snow Leopard Lion and the wireless keyboard came with the mid-2010 iMac.\n\nEDIT: It seems like the functionality is in the driver rather than in the keyboard itself. When using the keyboard in Windows 7 the caps lock key works in a regular manner. The drivers that Windows uses are standard HID Keyboard drivers provided by Microsoft.\n\nA: Sadly, ends up the delay is built into the keyboard hardware, so it\u2019s still there even if you remap the Caps Lock key to some other function, such as Control.\n\nA: My main answer:\nApple deems this a feature, as documented in their knowledge base.  Apple does not document how to disable the delay.\nIn my experience, if you remap the caps-lock key on Mac OS X (in System Preferences .. Keyboard .. Modifier Keys), and e.g. map it to Control, then the delay goes away while I am logged into Mac OS X.  So as koiyu suggests in the comments here, it seems like there is some variation available between the hardware and the keyboard driver.\nRemaining questions:\nMy own problem is that the delay remains when I boot into Ubuntu Linux, and in that context, even when I remap the Caps Lock key to Control, the delay is still present.  So the vanilla keyboard driver provided on Ubuntu Linux still suffers from the delay.\nSo my questions at this point:\n\n*\n\n*How is it that the standard Windows 7 driver has no delay and the Linux driver does have the delay?\n\n\n*How can one replicate disabling the delay in the context of a Linux installation atop the laptop?\n\nA: If you have both a laptop and external mac keyboard, turning on the caps lock on both of them might work. That's because you'll trick the mac keyboard into thinking its turning the caps lock off, which has no delay. This is probably only useful if your caps lock key is something that's not caps lock, so you are always pretending to \"turn off\" the caps lock, when instead the key is remapped to something else.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4068", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

What combination of keys do I press to produce the command symbol (\u2318) on Mac OS X?\n(I copied the above symbol from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key.)\n\nA: This is the simple way on how to do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download BetterTouchTool\n\n*Open the application\n\n*Select 'keyboard'\n\n*Click Add New Shortcut\n\n*Set keyboard shortcut to 'Option+C'\n\n*Set trigger predefined action to 'Paste predefined text'\n\n*Copy '\u2318' into the box.\n\n*Click Ok\n\n\nNow whenever BetterTouchTool is open all you have to do is press 'Option+C' and it automatically types the '\u2318' symbol.\nYou only have to do steps one to eight once.\n\nA: I also found it hard to find a straight answer for this, so I just went into System Preferences > Keyboard > Text and created a use symbol and text substitution option where when I type (cmd) it replaces it with the command symbol.\n\nA: For what it's worth (on OSX and maybe Windows): In Libre Offices's Writer I found the symbol as the 5th entry in both the LiHei Pro and LiSong fonts. \n\nA: The Mac Characters popup is definitely the straightforward solution if you need to insert some chacters once in a while. But if you regularly need to use Unicode characters which are not present on your keyboard then a radical solution would be creating your own keyboard layout with Ukelele that will map those characters to your physical keys.\nThe app is only used to create an OSX compliant layout file (XML or bundle) which can then be added via Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources > \uff0b.\nWith Ukelele you can clone your existing standard keyboard (File > New from current input source), and remap any of the keys to your liking.\nIn the default keyboard layout holding the Option key \u2325 in combination with any letter/symbol key will insert extended math characters which normally are never used, e.g. \u0153\u2211\u00b4\u00ae\u2020\u00a5\u00a8\u02c6\u00f8\u03c0\u201c\u2018\u00ab\u00e6\u2026\u00ac\u02da\u2206\u02d9\u00a9\u0192\u2202\u00df\u00e5\u03a9\u2248\u00e7\u221a\u222b\u02dc\u00b5\u2264\u2265\u00f7\u00bf\u02d8\u00af\u00c2\u02dc\u0131\u25ca\u00c7\u02db\u00b8\u00c5\u00cd\u00ce\u00cf\u02dd\u00d3\u00d4\uf8ff\u00d2\u00da\u00c6\u00bb\u2019\u201d\u220f\u00d8\u02c6\u00a8\u00c1\u02c7\u2030\u201e\u201e. Holding down Shift+Option will give you yet another set of special characters.\nWith Ukelele you can remap Option+key and Shift+Option+key to anything you like including Unicode emoji characters.\nHere is an example of assigning \u2318 to the Option+c combination:\n\nYou can pick the required character for mapping using the built-in Characters app as explained in other answers.\n\nNote: If you have a non-US keyboard (i.e. non-ANSI) you might need to set the correct type under View > Keyboard Type > Coding: ISO \n\nWhile this might be overkill for a single character, it actually makes sense when you want to tweak other things on your keyboard and have complete control.\nOnce you have created your custom layout you can use it on any number of macs by simply copying it to ~/Library/Keyboard\\ Layouts and then adding it in Preferences without the need to use any third party apps. The layout can be installed directly from Ukelele via the File > Install option. Once installed you still need to add it manually via Preferences > Keyboard.\nDisclaimer: I am not affiliated with the app author.

You'll find it under Edit -> Emoji and Symbols in any program that takes text input. The Command key symbol can be found by searching for it's name \"place of interest\". To insert the character, double click it.\n\n\nIf you're really hardcore and are looking for a way to type the character by entering the Unicode hex code, this is possible:\n\n*\n\n*Go into System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources, click \"+\", scroll to \"others\", select \"Unicode Hex Input\" and click \"Add\"\n\n\n\n*From the input source selector in the menu bar, select \"Unicode Hex Input\"\n\n\n\n*To enter a Unicode character, hold down option and type the 4-digit hex code for the character and it will be inserted.

{"text": "Q: Why does the Finder run at such a low process priority? I'm at a bit of a loss about this.\nI'm running a big import in aperture, and it's causing my system to slow down to a complete crawl, basically rendering it unusable for anything, even browsing the web. Since this seems a bit unnatural, I spent a little time looking around.\nRunning ps -Al shows that, apparently by default, the Dock, Finder, and SystemUIServer all seem to run at a priority far lower then userland applications. While user applications typically have a priority of 33, the Dock, Finder, etc have a priority of 53.\nThe end result, is ANY processor intensive task completely clobbers the UI, and renders the system unusable until it finishes.\nAnyways, using renice -20 -p <prid> bumps them up to the same priority as the rest of the userland UI, and results in not having to wait 1-3 seconds (!) for the UI to respond to something as simple as a mouse click.\nThad said, I have two questions:\nIs there any reason I shouldn't be altering the thread priority of the finder like this?\nIs there any way to make the priority change persistent, e.g. so it stays that way after reboot.\n\nA: I'm not sure anyone short of Apple's own developers would be able to answer this question, Finder's inner secrets are their domain. If you do think there are some noticeable lag problems with the UI you might want to submit a bug report to Apple about it.\nJudging from the sound of things (processes intentionally taking up all resources) this is a bit of an edge case for memory management. I've yet to see a system perform at their best without somewhere around 10-20% resources free, as a buffering aid.\nJust curious, what are these processes you're running?\n\nA: \"I'm running a big import in aperture, and it's causing my system to slow down to a complete crawl\"\nThen Aperture is (probably) the program you want to renice, not the others. The processes you mentioned are tuned relative to average user applications, so that user applications get higher priority and remain responsive, since they are what users use most of the time.\nYour case is the less-common one, where an application is performing a long-term, intensive task and the user wants to do something else at the same time. By default, it's the user's applications that get priority so that these intensive tasks get more resources and complete sooner.\nFor every user that complains that other applications aren't being responsive enough, there is another user complaining that the active application isn't running fast enough.\nIf you are running a long, resource intensive task and you know you want it to have lower priority so you can use other processes while the task completes\u2014and you don't mind if the intensive task takes longer\u2014you should lower the priority of the process running the intensive task.\nAs for your second question, there are several possible solutions for making the renice more automatic. For example, you could create a script applet that runs Aperture at a lower priority and use that to start Aperture. Or you could start Aperture via a shell script stored in a *.command file (however, that will open Terminal and run the command in a terminal window, which may not be what you want). Each of these is a little involved. If you would like examples, I can see about providing them later.\n\nA: I posed a similar question - long ago, on ServerFault - though not as specifically focused on the Finder (although I DO find the Finder to be intolerably slow, as well).

The NETGEAR WN511B runs at 126 Mbps or 270 Mbps when accessing this router. \nMine was set on \"Up to 270 Mbps\" mode. the iPod/iPhone's do not support this mode very well.\nTHe best choice i found was the \"Up to 130 Mbps\" mode.\nMy iPod connected straight away and has worked perfectly with my hidden network.\nStep 4. Be sure to save and apply your settings.\nIf this helps anyone, please post a reply. Interested to know if this is \"one\" solution to what could be one of many problems on this topic, actually works for others.\n<3 Dallen :]\n\nA: Interesting scenario, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s an existing easy solution to this problem. Part of the problem in solving this particular issue, is that the iPod (and its iOS) are fairly closed environments where you can hardly modify anything beyond what the UI offers. If the device is not reconnecting (despite having knowledge of the network), there\u2019s no magic option to \u201cflip\u201d and expect it to work; especially considering that you\u2019ve stated that nothing on the networking side should/must be changed. Even if changing certain network parameters in the router were allowed by you, I don\u2019t recall anything that could help you there. You might want to try (for the sake of testing) disabling the \u201cother\u201d network, or little things like that. Not because you will necessarily reach a solution, but at least you might find the root of the problem or the cause and either find a workaround or\u2026 spiritually deal with it. ;)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4099", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

However, the browse button to display the select file dialog is disabled. Normally this works fine on my Windows PC. Should I be able to select image files to upload from Safari on iPhone?\n\nA: Specifically the browse button is disabled because there isn't a file browser (like Windows Explorer/Finder) on the iPhone. Most people don't notice that, because the iOS is designed around avoiding the need for a user interface to the iPhone's file system.\nFor simplicity's sake file management is turned into a programing problem instead of a user problem. For security's sake applications can't directly access the documents of other applications.\nAs Jawa mention, a lot of sites have iPhone applications to allow uploads.\n\nA: No, uploading from mobile Safari is not possible. That's why about every other site that utilizes user uploads (e.g. Flickr, Facebook, Picasa) have either made their own upload app for the iPhone, or there are some apps that can handle many sites, such as Pixelpipe.\n\nA: As of iOS 6, Mobile Safari now supports file (image) uploads, from the Camera Roll, albums, and photostreams. Note that iOS 6 is only available for the iPhone 3GS and newer.\n\nA: You can't upload files using mobile Safari.\nEven though, you can either use iCab Mobile browser which support file upload or can use native iOS applications which are seamless integrated with a webspage.

It will be probably located in your Movies folder. Assuming you have connected your external drive and the drive is ready to use (i.e. Partitioned and Formatted) for OS X, you simply have to open two Finder Windows (use CMD + N to open a new finder window).\nAfter you have the two Finder windows, navigate one to where you see the project in your /Movies folder. and in the other Finder, go to your external drive. \nClick in the iMovie project and Drag it to the other finder window (don\u2019t release the mouse/trackpad button). When you reach your external drive, release it. \nIt will be copied, not moved. When the copy is over, simply drag the old one to the Trash. :)\nI\u2019m sorry if this sounds too simple (or too complicated), the thing is that the nature of your question could be as simple as \u201chow do I copy a file in OS X\u201d or as complicated as \u201cI got a new hard drive and I want to use it\u201d.

{"text": "Q: What are the folders in OS X that I should know about? I just got my first Mac (a MacBook Pro) last Sunday and I am LOVING everything about it so far! But, I am a little confused about the folders in OS X.\nPlease go through the folders I should know about, and the folders I shouldn't worry about (or should stay away from). I have a little Linux knowledge to go off of, but things are still different enough that I'm disoriented.\nI'm running the latest, at this time of writing, version of OS X 10.6.5 Snow Leopard. But if any folders have changed over the past few versions, please note them! :)\n\nA: I\u2019m going to resume them by memory, so future edits will probably fix all the mess I might type now. :)\nThe file structure of OS X resembles a typical Unix/Linux operating system (which in fact is the root of it all), albeit with some \u201cApple\u201d differences. Some of those differences have aliases to keep the \u201cunix\u201d heart happy, but some are simply modified to be used as such. \nIn short here are the major \u201cfolders\u201d in your file system:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications : This one is self explanatory, all your Mac\u2019s apps should go there (unless you have an app that you want to be visible for only one user\u2026). Normal users can read, \u201cadmins\u201d can also drop things in there. \n\n*/Developer : if you install Xcode and the developer libraries, this folder will magically bring the unicorns for developing awesome Cocoa apps, iOS apps and dashboard widgets among other things. Otherwise the folder doesn\u2019t even exist.\n\n*/Library : Shared libraries, and files necessary for OS X to actually function. Preferences, settings, app stuff, browser plug-ins (or more specifically, how to get rid of Adobe\u2019s Flash) ;) You usually don\u2019t tamper around here, but it\u2019s normal if you want to clear some Apps settings, fix something, remove or install browser plugins, extensions, etc. Sometimes you will venture into /Library. Handle with care and always backup before breaking stuff here. It would be hard to destroy an OS X install by tampering /Library, but it\u2019s possible\u2026\n\n*/Network : All network libraries, servers, devices, etc. You shouldn\u2019t be here unless you know what you\u2019re doing and want to bypass GUI utilities. In almost 7 years of OS X, I\u2019ve never touched this directory.\n\n*/System : Everything that OS X needs to properly function is here. I\u2019d say that you shouldn\u2019t touch anything or problems will arise. \n\n*/Users : This is the equivalent to Unix and Linux's /home directory. And here you will have sub directories for each of your users: /Users/John, /Users/Doe, etc. Inside your home folder you will have a \u201csimilar\u201d structure. See later for more /Users\u2019 love. \n\n*/Volumes: Mounted stuff/devices and volumes, real or virtual (think of CDs, DMGs, samba shares, etc), get their own \u201cdirectory\u201d here. So if you mount a smb share called MyShare, you can \u2018cd /Volumes/MyShare\u2019 to access it from the Command Line. The Finder will happily hide this from you (unless you set it to show invisible files I think).\n\n*/bin : What else can be said about bin that you don\u2019t know already from your Linux knowledge. Same thing. If you install \u2018git\u2019 for example, it will go to /usr/local/git\u2026 so you get the idea. Obviously all the essential common binaries are here too. Think the command \u2018ls\u2019\u2026 it\u2019s there, in all its glory.\n\n*/etc : Oh the great \u201cetcetera\u201d\u2026 Just like any other Unix, local system configs and\u2026 etcetera. It\u2019s \u201csimilar\u201d to any other unix, with some Apples. But the purpose is the same and some of the files (rc.local for example) exist. Go ahead and take a look, but if you break it, you have to pay for it. (OS X uses \u2018launchd\u2019 to launch stuff, so google for that if you want to -for example- start a subversion daemon at startup, forget all you knew about runlevels). Otherwise, get insurance between tweaking too much in there, because it\u2019s not covered by Apple Stack\u2019s Exchange damaging policy ;)\n\n*/dev : honoring it\u2019s \u201cunix\u201d background, the device files representing peripherals are here. Who touches this anyway\u2026\n\n*/usr : I googled for a good description of this and came up with a clever one: \n\n\n\n\"Second major hierarchy, includes\n  subdirectories that contain\n  information, configuration files, and\n  other essentials used by the operating\n  system\u201d\n\n\n\n*/sbin : Also coming from the Unix nature of OS X, the system binaries, and administration utilities. These are not the droids you\u2019re looking for, move along, move along. \n\n*/tmp : The one and only temp directory! Batteries not included. Note that this is not the \u201ctrash\u201d. This is the real Unix temp. Unless you like being around waste, you shouldn\u2019t have to wander around there. Cron jobs will keep it clean (tho it doesn\u2019t hurt to restart your OS X every now and then). \n\n*/var : Var is for variable data. Logs, and stuff that will \u201cvary\u201d during the operating system operation. You rarely walk through these rapidly changing places, but sometimes you have to hunt for logs or errors. Bring and umbrella there, it changes very often\u2026\n\n\nOk and what\u2019s with this /Users thing?\nThe Users folder contains your \u2018home\u2019. You have easy to identify folders (i.e.: if you can\u2019t identify what Music, Documents, Movies, Downloads, Desktop and Pictures are for, then the problem might lie elsewhere), but at the same time, there are notable \u201cduplicates\u201d. What? Yes. You have a Library and an Applications folder here too! \nI believe you\u2019re already guessing what is all this about. Yes, all application settings that are for the user only will go in here (to ~/Library). That means that, although OS X will first look at /Library, if you install a (for example) browser plug-in in your ~/Library (instead of /Library), it will be found, but only by you. My ~/Applications folder is barely empty, it contains some Steam (games) in there, apparently they go there and not /Applications. (I just checked, i didn\u2019t know that, so go figure how often I use my home\u2019s App folder). \nupdate: Apparently this Application folder in your home directory doesn\u2019t exist by default, but you can always create it and drop applications you want to keep for yourself. If you have no permissions to install stuff in /Applications, you can always use a private copy of an app in your ~/Applications folder.  \nThings not mentioned above that you might have\n\n\n*\n\n*/opt : (tional). As its name implies, it\u2019s sometimes used by daemons as a place to store suff (but it\u2019s usually optional, so you can put those things elsewhere). I remember that when running Subversion daemons, I had that directory and the repos would go to /opt/svn/repositories, but that was just me\u2026 never trust me.\n\n*/private : The best way to understand why we have this strange directory here, is to simply go ahead and read it from an expert (or read it directly from the question in Apple SE.): \n\n\n\u2026and I quote: \n\n\"AIUI it's a holdover from NextStep\n  (which OS X is based on), and NextStep\n  did it to support NetBooting. The idea\n  was that you could boot from a\n  network-hosted volume (probably\n  read-only, and certainly shared with\n  other computers), and early in the\n  boot process mount a local (writable)\n  volume on /private; as g mentioned,\n  this allowed runtime-modification of\n  /var and /tmp, as well as per-computer\n  settings in /etc.\nThis isn't needed anymore, as Apple's\n  current NetBoot system uses a shadow\n  disk image to store changes anywhere\n  on the boot volume. But some\n  programs/docs/etc now assume the files\n  live under /private, so it'd be too\n  much trouble to switch them back\u2026\u201d\n\nSo there it is, this is more or less the OS X\u2019s file hierarchy. Don\u2019t drink and drive around it, it\u2019s more fragile than what it looks.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4125", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "16"}}

{"text": "Q: Where does Command-Shift-3 or Command-Shift-4 (for taking screen captures) originate from? I know that on Mac OS X, you can take a screen capture of the entire screen with Command+Shift+3 and you can take a screen capture of just a selection (or a window) with Command+Shift+4. Is there a rationale for this keyboard combination? What is the history of that command? Where does Command+Shift number originate from?\n\nA: \nWhat\u2019s an FKEY?\nFKEY\u2019s (Function Keys) are resources containing executable code that are called upon by hitting the keys Command-Shift-# (any number 0-9) at the same time. In the standard System file there are two FKEY\u2019s; with an ID#3 and #4 that are used to dump the current screen or window onto disk or printer.1\n\n\nSo far as I can remember/find, screenshot commands were first added to the OS itself in System 6.2\n\n1 Text and image from FKEY that runs other FKEYs!   by John Holder (MacTech magazine, 1988)\n2 Further reading/references: Mel's Macintosh Universe: Macintosh Plus and a forum posting from 2003, How do I take a screen shot (the latter of which features some guy named Chealion).\n\nA: Dori's answer was correct, but I figured I'd add just a little more history. Early Mac Keyboards did not contact Function Keys (F1 through F12 etc). In place of Function Keys, they allowed the user to type Command+Shift+1 through Command+Shift+9.\nPrior to Mac OS X, the system software contained a \"Suitcase\" called \"System\". This was the heart of Mac OS classic, and contained the code necessary to boot and run the machine. However this code was not located in the data fork of the file, it was located in the proprietary Mac OS Resource Fork which is set up like a database -- every resource has a type, which is a four byte value, and an ID.\nPrior to Mac OS 9, all application code was in resources of type CODE. In the system suitcase, there was a special resource of type FKEY. These were essentially just CODE resources, with the exception that FKEY resources 0 - 9 would be executed when the corresponding Command+Shift+number key was pressed.\nIf I recall correctly, the Command+Shift+1 FKEY ejected the floppy and the Command+Shift+2 FKEY ejected the floppy in the second drive (external or of a two-floppy Mac (e.g. some SE/30s)). But there were software developers out there who made FKEYs. I remember as a kid having all the open FKEY \"slots\" filled. One let me draw freehand on the screen (my love for freehand circles started early :-) and one put the Mystery Science Theater 3000 characters at the bottom of my screen.\n\nA: Apple Technical Note OS01, dated \"Mar 01 1985\", describes the mechanism of command-shift-1 through command-shift-4.  Originally, 3 took a screenshot to disk, and 4 sent a screenshot directly to the printer.\nThey didn't all use FKEY.  1 and 2 were processed by GetNextEvent, but captured by the system.  3 and 4 used the FKEY defined in the System file.  5 through 9 were available for the user, via FKEY.  0 doesn't seem to have been supported.\nAccording to Wikipedia's table of release dates, this technote was written just before System 2.0 was released.  They also claim (without reference) that System 2 introduced this shortcut for screenshots.  Perhaps Apple wrote the technote prior to the actual release.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4140", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}
{"text": "Q: How can I unmount a drive every time I reboot? As relates to an answer to a previous question, I'd like to unmount a built-in hard drive every time I boot up. (Or alternately arrange for it not to be mounted). How do I do this?\n\nA: The following Hint on Mac OS X Hints details a way to do this. Basically you'll create (or modify) the file /etc/fstab and add a line similar to:\nUUID=F0E430C1-5558-3BB3-9FA9-6904B663FEEA  none  hfs  rw,noauto\n\nThe actual UUID will vary, you can find the UUID for your disk in system.log:\n\nIn Mac OS X Panther, Disk Utility and the diskutil command doesn't display the UUID value. But if you look in the system.log file, when the disk is mounted, you can see something similar to this (line breaks added for narrower display):\n \u2026 localhost diskarbitrationd[87]: disk1s9   hfs  \n   77F3E84D-E0ED-3194-96A5-BED10893FFF4  FireWire HD    \n   /Volumes/FireWire HD\n \u2026 localhost diskarbitrationd[87]: disk1s10  hfs  \n   F0E430C1-5558-3BB3-9FA9-6904B663FEEA  Mac OS X Disc \n   /Volumes/Mac OS X Disc\n\nThe string before the volume name is the UUID for the disk.\n\n\nA: Use a LaunchAgent (see Lingon) that runs at boot to unmount. If it runs too quickly, add a wait/pause/sleep. The action that unmounts can be in whatever you preferred scripting/automation language is (bash (hdiutil), Automator, AppleScript, etc.)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4144", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}

{"text": "Q: Driving down the road and GPS works on iPod? I was riding in the car today and the as I was traveling home, decided to pull up maps on the iPod.  I know that GPS isn't used by iPod and uses wifi to triangulate it's position.  However I wasn't connected to any wifi as I was traveling through town and my iPod kept up with my position?  How?\n\nA: I'm guessing, since I couldn't find any confirmation, but the iPods use the Skyhook network, which is basically a big database of wifi access points and their approximate location. Since you wouldn't have been connected to a network, (here's the guess) the geolocation service must've cached some amount of the database for your general area.\n\nA: I don't think you have to have a WiFi connection for it to triangulate off of WiFi signals.  As long as you have WiFi turned on, the iPod can see the WiFi networks within range. It doesn't have to be connected to any of them.\nnote: the following is mostly speculation\nThe iPod has a WiFi receiver in it that's on all the time (unless you purposely turn it off).  The receiver is constantly listening for WiFi signals.  If you open your Settings and look at WiFi you'll see a list of WiFi access points that are within range.  Your iPod might not be connected to any of them but it knows their name (more importantly the unique SSID) and it knows how strong the signal is.\nThe iPod also stores a database of the locations of known SSIDs.  Then it does some fancy calculations.  So, if it knows that SSID A's signal is stronger than SSID B's signal it assumes you're closer to A.  With enough signals around you, it can make a pretty good approximation of your location. \nEven moving quickly, it can sense changes in signal strength as you move and recalculate your position.  In a town/city you'll likely have a lot of known signals.  Try driving out on a remote highway.  You'll likely lose any position information.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4147", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: How to stop an iPhone 3G from using cell data, ever? My wife has inherited my iPhone 3G and it's using a few megabytes of GPRS data every month even though she doesn't deliberately use any services that cost mobile data. The problem is that she doesn't have a data plan, so these few MB's cost as much as a few gigabytes would with a data plan. \n1: How can I set up the iPhone 3G (OS 3.1.3) so that it absolutely never sends or receives any data except on wifi?\n2: Also, what is sending/receiving this GPRS data if it isn't the user? My wife never launches the web browser or other Internet-needing apps.\nPlease don't simply suggest the obvious get a data plan because my wife doesn't want one. She wants to use the thing as a cell phone and for text messaging, but certainly absolutely positively no Internet or e-mail or whatever, except when she's on our home's wifi.\nI thought I had thoroughly turned off mobile data. Here's what I've done so far (written from my memory, might be inaccurate):\nSettings > General > Network:\n- enable 3G = off\n- cellular data = off\n- data roaming = off\nSBsettings:\n- 3G = off\n- data = off\n- bluetooth = off\n- location = off\nBased on all this, the damn thing should only use wifi, but somehow it uses GPRS data anyway. Argh!\nSolution:\nWell, I didn't manage to turn off the mobile data usage despite all your very useful and helpful suggestions. Instead, I spoke with the provider and they offered me 8 months of 1GB-per-months for free, and after that I'm free to cancel it or continue at \u20ac7 per month (or whatever the rate will be at that time). They also gave me the money back for the data costs on the last bill. Very good customer service, thank you tele.ring of Austria.\n\nA: That's pretty bizarre. This should have done it:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*enable 3G = off\n  \n*cellular data = off\n  \n*data roaming = off\n  \n\nThe only thing I can think of is perhaps visual voicemail? If you have this turned on and it's working then it's using data. Try turning it off. If not, then I'm not really sure what the problem could be, but I suggest calling up your carrier and asking them to block data on their end so that you don't get charged for it.\n\nA: It is possible to have a voice-only no-data iPhone.\nBe careful about trying to set this up yourself on the phone. Phones have been known to use data (and get charged) even when all phone options have been set to not use data.\nYour best bet is to call the carrier and ask them to disable all data from their end.\n\nA: Changing the APN (if you have access to those settings, AFAIK some carriers block that specific menu) to some random set of chars (fake APN) will disable all data communications. However, everytime you try to access internet, the iPhone will pop up a message saying that you are not subscribed to a cellular data service.\nYou can also change it to a fake one even if your carrier disallowed access to that setting, by visiting http://www.unlockit.co.nz/ using your iPhone and letting it install the fake settings for you.\n\nA: I can add a few things that bothered me when I did the same.\n\n\n*\n\n*I had to go to the network settings of the carrier and remove the user/pass for the \u201cEDGE\u201d network. Inserting bogus information prevented the iPhone from connecting at all.\n\n*Voicemail. Here in spain we have visual voicemail (and so do other EU countries as well). I disabled the voicemail too (there is a ## command you can type, ask in your company). \nDespite having everything disabled, the phone, notably mail, tried to do things, but after #1, it started failing (giving me an annoying popup that it couldn\u2019t connect). So I went ahead and obliterated Mail settings, and such. \nSince then it has been silent. ;)\n\nA: You can switch mobile data off in Settings.  \nGo to Settings > General > Network and set the Mobile/Cellular Data switch to the 'Off' position\nSee this Apple Support note for exactly what turning off Cellular Data affects.\n\nA: Actually there's one thing you can do, and that's mess up with carrier settings. APN is the keyword here. Under Settings / General / Network you should have a menu Cellular Data. If you don't (and you probably do not) have it, search for APN on cydia. You should find something there to enable it. Then just clear up all fields in that menu.\nAnother option would be going to www.iphone-notes.de/mobileconfig or other similar websites on your iphone and install a invalid carrier setting. I'm not sure this would do the trick, but with the proper custom .mobileconfig I'm sure you could.\nGood luck! ;)\n\nA: In my country (Australia) we are able to ask the mobile provider to disable data on our accounts to ensure we cannot use any at all, and thus cannot be charged for it unwillingly. It might be worth calling up the provider and asking if they can disable the data service.\n\nA: If your wife hast set up an email account: are the \"fetch\" settings set to \"manual\"?\n\nA: Try turning off location services and see if it helps. If I remember correctly, the iPhone 3G has assisted GPS, so it might be using a data connection to help with satellite acquisition.\n\n\"Standalone\" or \"Autonomous\" GPS operation use radio signals from satellites alone. A-GPS additionally uses network resources to locate and utilize the satellites faster as well as better in poor signal conditions. [...] An Assisted GPS system can address these problems by using data available from a network.\n\n\nA: You could call your carrier and tell them to block all data from the SIM card.\n\nA: Put it in Airplane mode! Works for me.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4162", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "17"}}
{"text": "Q: Spaces makes dialogs disappear I'll be working in a space, and then something starts bouncing in the dock (like Mail), so I switch to that space, and I see a dialog for a split second, but then it disappears.  I try moving the main window, to see if the dialog went behind it or something, but it isn't there.  While I can move the main window, I cannot interact with it because the dialog is modal.  If I switch to a different space then I see the dialog again for just a split second.\nEventually if I switch spaces enough times the dialog will stop disappearing.  I haven't found any pattern that works reliably.  Another solution is to disable spaces, close the dialog, and then enable spaces and move everything back to the correct windows again.\nIt is rather annoying.  It happens with multiple applications too.  I've tried selecting the application by clicking on it in the dock, or switching to the space, and I get the same behavior.  \nThe question is: Is there an easy way to get to the dialog box, or to keep spaces from doing this?  Thanks!\n\nA: A bit better of a workaround is to hide the app with the dialog, then showing it again. That typically puts the dialog on top of the z axis, I noticed. Still annoying.

That causes another modal dialog to pop up, and when I dismiss that one, the one that first came up shows up next. The risk is that the app will just quit. (It might also just ignore it... results seem to vary by application.)\nTo tell an application to quit via Apple script do this from a terminal window on the same space as the application:\n  osascript -e \"tell Application \\\"NameHere\\\" to quit\"\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4171", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}
{"text": "Q: How can I make VLC output its sound through USB headphones? Whenever I plug-in my earphones with a round connection into my MacBook Pro, the sound automatically switches to them. Whenever I plug my headphones with a USB connection (Logitech USB ClearChat Comfort Headset) and I am playing sound in iTunes, the sound automatically switches. Whenever I plug in my headphones and VLC is playing, the sound continues to play through the speakers. Is there any way to make VLC work with my USB headphones?\nUpdate: It seems that the headphones don't work properly with Skype either.\n\nA: VLC can't switch audio interfaces on-the-fly. You either have to stop playing media entirely, and go into the preferences and change it, then start playing your media again; or, the slightly easier way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kill VLC\n\n*Plug in headphones (and ensure they become the primary output sound device, hold option and click the sound icon in your menu bar, select usb headphones if necessary)\n\n*Start VLC\n\n\nAssuming VLCs preferences are still set to use the Default Audio Device for output, then it'll use them when you start playing content again.\n\nA: Ask and you shall receive...\nI logged this as a bug on VLC and they delivered within 2hrs!\nhttps://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/9231\n\nA: Since you're getting iTunes and system sounds through the headset, it should be set as the default audio device, but check the the Sound  Preferences pane to make sure.  After this, try restarting VLC to get it to use the new default audio device.  This should also work for Skype, however Skype should have options in the preferences menu that will let you choose the audio output/input device.  Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any similar option in VLC.\n\nA: Exiting VLC player, and then changing the default Sound Output to Logitech USB Speakers worked for me.  So long as the Logitech speakers are plugged in before you open VLC player and System preferences are set correctly then VLC should play through the Speakers.\nI know a lot of people use VLC player instead of Quicktime, because some Windows files don't play sound on Quicktime, but work perfectly on VLC player.  Although this may have changed since Snow Leopard and the latest version of Quicktime.\nHope this helps.\nToria\n\nA: Hmm, I can switch audio devices in VLC on the fly without problems: \n\nIt defaults to the device defined in the system settings on startup.\n\nA: I've just solved the problem like this (without killing the app): I went into the Bluetooth settings (long click on the main icon in the main settings of my smartphone) and saw that \"Media audio - Connected to media audio\" was checked. I unchecked it, checked again, and yey, the sound is coming from the loudspeaker, finally :) I hope I won't have to do this every time though :/ \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4173", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

{"text": "Q: How do I change the playback speed in iTunes? On the iPhone I can speed up the playback of podcasts to 2x.\nIs there a way to do the same in iTunes?  \n\nA: There is a Mac menubar app, that allows you to change the playback speed in iTunes. http://wetfish.de/\n\nA: This is not natively possible in the Mac version of iTunes (nor Windows for the matter). You don\u2019t mention if you have OS X or Windows. If you have the former, you have two choices: \n1) If the podcast is an MP3 file, you can convert the file to an AAC file in iTunes (with an extension of m4a.) and then change the extension to m4b; the file becomes an audiobook which can be played faster if I am not mistaken.\n2) Another alternative is to hear it in Quicktime, which has speed controls: Right click the file in iTunes and choose \"Show In Finder\u201d. Option-click the file (right click) and select \u201cOpen With\u2026\u201d, select QuickTime.

It\u2019s very common, it happens in the best software shops and until the vendor fixes the memory leak, there is nothing you can do (other than send them the bug report and pray).\n\n*If this behavior is exhibited by more software, there might be a problem with your hardware memory (RAM).

Now it does take some care and feeding, like running port selfupdate every day, and the big tip is to check \nport variants \n\nso if you have a python dependency, you can run \nport install python +no_tkinter \n\nand avoid the agonizingly long Tk install, which would be most unwelcome on a Quartz architecture anyway.\nWith this, you can freely run software update and not have your stuff break, since it does not depend on anything but the compiler from apple.

{"text": "Q: What's the little plastic clip on the headset good for? On my iPhone headset (the one that came with the device, as well as the in-ear buds) there's a little piece of plastic that slides on the cable to one earbud, and can clip onto the other cable. \n\n\n*\n\n*It's not large enough to accommodate the headset cable below the split, so it can't be used to somehow hold the cable in place when it's curled up. \n\n*It's not tight enough to stay in place if I slide it nearer the earbud, so it can't be used to essentially move the point where the cable splits closer to the earbuds.\n\n*It's not tight enough to really hold on to the other earbud cable. It takes nearly no effort at all to pull the cables apart.\n\n\nWhat in the world is it good for?!? \n\nA: It's good for avoiding tangles when you're not using your earbuds, or when you are using them, from preventing you from tearing your earbuds.

{"text": "Q: Possible to Hide Mac Partition When in Windows? I've found out that if I install Windows 7 and use the Snow Leopard Boot Camp drivers (Which I need for the graphics chipset drivers.), the Mac partition appears and is read-only. I'm quite concerned about this, because if my Windows partition is infected with malware, it could be a possibility that the hackers could take data from my Mac partition, even if it was read-only.\nIs there any way to turn off Mac partition support while booted in Windows?\n\nA: I'm not a windows guy, so the steps are probably different but this SuperUser question asks how to disable a partition under Windows XP. The steps may be similar under Windows 7:\n\nYou could remove the drive letter\n  assignment for the specific\n  partition(s):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Go to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Computer\n  Management\n  \n*Expand Computer Management (Local) > Storage > Disk Management\n  \n*Right click the specific partition you like to hide and select \"Change\n  Drive Letter and Paths\"\n  \n*Select the drive letter shown, click \"Remove\" and click \"OK\"\n  \n\n\nA: From a theoretical standpoint, even if you delete the Boot Camp drivers and/or remove the drive letter, a virus could still interface with the disk at very low level and read your data. From a practical standpoint, this is unlikely to happen as there is much more low-hanging fruit for hackers.\nStill, if you want to run Windows on your Mac without the possibility, even theoretical, of the compromised Windows system being able to access your Mac data, you have essentially two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Windows in a VM and only allow it access to its virtual disk\n\n*Turn FileVault on for your user account\n\n\nFor the latter option the theoretical virus could still access your applications and general system settings, but it would not be able to access any user data without the FileVault password.\n\nA: Remove the following keys from the Windows Registry (backup first) to disable the Apple HFS driver:\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AppleHFS]\n\"Type\"=dword:00000002\n\"ErrorControl\"=dword:00000001\n\"Start\"=dword:00000000\n\"Group\"=\"File System\"\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AppleMNT]\n\"Type\"=dword:00000002\n\"ErrorControl\"=dword:00000001\n\"Start\"=dword:00000000\n\"Group\"=\"File System\"\n\nYou can use the same registry fragment above to restore HFS functionality if you forgot to backup your registry before making any changes.\n\nA: I\u2019m sure someone with more Windows experience will provide a better alternative here, because if that is possible, it\u2019s only possible through a Windows setting/hack/etc. I\u2019m sure you can find the HFS+ driver and uninstall it from windows\u2026 but I don\u2019t use bootcamp. :(\n\nA: In Windows, you can go into Disk Management and choose \"Change Drive Letter and Paths...\" and then Remove the existing drive letter.

{"text": "Q: Constrain Columns of Files in Finder to only 3? I like how in Finder, they only have 3 columns of files before the files wrap to a new row. However, when I lend out my USB to some friends, they don't have \"Snap to Grid\" enabled, which causes them to \"add\" in the 4th column, which messes up the view of the USB. Every time this happens, I have to manually drag everything back. This is quite time consuming and fine if I only have to do this once. However, I lend out my USB multiple times every week. It's quite a headache.\nIs there a way to force Finder to constrain the columns of files to only 3 columns?\n\nA: The setting your refer to, is stored in a hidden Finder file called .DS_STORE\nThis file is obviously overwritten by your friend\u2019s Mac who obviously uses different settings. \nAs far as I know, there\u2019s no way (other than perhaps making the file .DS_STORE read only in the USB so your friend\u2019s Mac cannot write the \u201cnew annoying settings\u201d to it). \nYou\u2019ll need to jump into the Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)\nConnect your USB Drive, open Terminal.\nIn Terminal, type:\ncd /Volumes\nls \n\nYou should see your own Macintosh HD (or whatever name your internal drive(s) have) and the USB drive (with the name it might have).\nCd into the USB drive like:\ncd MyUSBDrive\n\nif the drive has spaces in its name, you must enclose it between quotes\nFor example: \ncd \u201cMy Strange USB\u201d\n\nOnce in there, you can perform an \u2018ls\u2019 to view the contents of the USB. Do that to make sure it\u2019s the right one. Else go back to cd  /Volumes and start over :)\nNow adjust the settings in the finder the way you want them.\nDone?\nNow to change the permissions in the USB drive: \nsudo chmod 444 .DS_Store\n\nNOTE: The above command might ask you for your password, that is ok. The password won\u2019t be seen when you type it. Just type your password and press enter. Remember the commands in Terminal are case sensitive. \nWhat does that do?: chmod is a command that changes the permissions of files and/or directories. In this case, since the file is a hidden file from the finder, we have to do the job from the terminal (which can always see hidden things). The numbers (444) are read only for everybody. \nIf you don\u2019t know what chmod does or how it works (or why 444) I recommend you take a look at the help (man page) for the command. In Terminal type:\nman chmod\n\nWill this work?\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t know. I believe it will, but I\u2019m not sure if ACLs are preserved in USB devices. If the USB is formatted with FAT32  (they usually are so Windows can read/write) the above might not work. \nOther than that, there\u2019s no magical way to tell finder do this, and do it this way. Because if there\u2019s a .DS_Store file, Finder will read settings from there. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4223", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}
{"text": "Q: Why 3G Consume More Battery than Wifi? From what I can recall, both 3G and Wifi should consume about the same about of battery when in operation. However, my field testing seems to indicate that 3G is more battery consuming than Wifi. \nIs this result general? If yes, why this is so?\n\nA: First of all, all wireless systems use the most power when transmitting, ie actively powering the antenna to upload data.\nNow, just think of the ranges the different systems have to bridge. WiFi works well for like 30 meters, or 100 meters outdoors. Usually, the nearest cell tower is considerably farther away than those 100 meters, therefore, 3G needs more power than WiFi.\nAdd to this that 3G is capable of opening multiple connections at once, and the fact that 3G autmatically boosts power output on weak signals, 3G needs more power.\n\nA: RotHorseKid is mostly right, however it's not quite as simple as distance \u2014\u00a0the operating frequency and bandwidth also affect the power usage.\nThe wikipedia page on dBm provides some approximate power levels for various transmitters, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Maximum output from a UMTS/3G mobile phone as anywhere from 125 mW to 2 W (for various power classes \u2014\u00a0I'm not sure where the iPhone 4 fits, nor any of the iPhones)\n\n*Typical laptop wifi transmission power of 32 mW (and I'm fairly sure the iPhones are below most laptops) with a maximum allowable power of 200 mW\n\n*Bluetooth output is 1.3 mW, 2.5 mW or 100 mW depending on range (1m, 10m 100m)\n\n\nNow it's not quite that simple, since the transmitters won't be 100% efficient, and there's associated electronics required for the communications to work (on top of the EM transmissions). Such electronics tend to use more power when they run at higher frequencies, and higher potential bandwidth will require a higher frequency (i.e. the supporting electronics of wifi probably uses more power than the supporting electronics of 3G, which in turn probably uses more power than the supporting electronics of Bluetooth).\nAt a guess, I'd say the supporting electronics would use between 10-100 mW (perhaps someone knows the actual comms chips and can provide specs?), so depending on the power class of the iPhone, it'd be comparable, but I'd still expect 3G to use significantly more power than wifi (and, anecdotally, my iPhone gets hotter when using 3G compared to wifi, which backs this up too).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4224", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: What's a reasonable approach for managing apps, associated with one iTunes account, on several iOS devices?

What's one to do?\nI've tried managing by hand which apps sync on which device, but this information gets lost periodically, which means a huge app dump across the iPad and iPhone 4.\nWhat would seem most effective is, while the \"purchased\" app pool would be common, each device would have a derived subset of this pool (so they wouldn't have to re-purchase), and so would/could never inadvertently sync apps from another device pool.\nI suppose the checkboxing of each app approximates this, but it's very frustrating when this information is lost.\nAny help for this?

Other than that, the only current solution is to manually check off each app you want on each device.\n\nA: The real question would seem to be - how does that information get lost?  I sync between three devices, an iPhone, iPad, and Touch also - I've not had it lose track of which apps were on which system.  How does that happen?\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4227", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: Does upgrading iOS change my IMEI? Does upgrading iOS change my IMEI? I was told not by AT&T not to remove my SIM card or certain restrictions that they had placed on the iPhone, at my request, would be lifted. I want to know if upgrading my iOS is like removing the SIM card. I think this was because the IMEI number changes when the SIM card is removed from the phone.\nDoes upgrading iOS change this number?\n\nA: The IMEI is kind of like a MAC address for the cellular network only. It is nearly impossible to change it, you can only spoof it on a software level. So the answer is, No, your IMEI will never change unless you really really want it to. Removing the SIM card shouldn't change the IMEI either...\n\nA: The IMEI shouldn\u2019t change when you upgrade the phone, at least here in Europe. Mine is still the same. \nUpdate: Upon some reading around, it turns out that if you \u201chack\u201d your phone, (maybe in the past), an update would change some IMEIs, and AT&T would therefore invalidate the SIM. Be careful with what you do :)\n\nA: No, upgrading the OS doesnt change the IMEI by default, there are hacks available to do it, but its illegal and hence, not recommended. \n\nA: No. Upgrading iOS won't change the IMEI of your iPhone.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4238", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: Does iOS 4.2 improve performance on the iPhone 3G? I've \"inherited\" an iPhone 3G from a friend who upgraded to iPhone 4. He had complined about the slowness of iOS 4. Although I personally have no problems with it, I was wondering if iOS 4.2 offers any noticeable performance improvement. Does iOS 4.2 improve performance on the iPhone 3G?\n\nA: From the iLounge article\n\nThus far iOS 4.2 appears to perform as\n  well as iOS 4.1 did under similar\n  conditions. Performance even on older\n  devices such as the iPhone 3G is the\n  same as iOS 4.1 and thus far we\n  haven\u2019t observed any significant\n  changes in battery life.\n\n\nA: It actually seems faster than 4.1 to me on my 3G.\n\nA: My iPhone 3G has become slower in some occasions with iOS 4.2 especially when pasting an address from Mail to Maps.\n\nA: I have an iPhone 3G that I use for testing. 4.2.1 seems insanely slow on it, but maybe that's just because I've gotten so used to the speed of the 3GS and iPhone 4 over the past two years and forget what the \"normal\" speed of a 3G should feel like.\n\nA: IOS4.2.1 is better than 4.1 for sure!!! I did not use yet the 3gs nor the iphone4, and got through every iOS \"upgrade\" available starting 3.1.3 , 4.0 , 4.0.1, 4.1 and probably yhe last one for the 3G 4.2.1 ! almost as fast as the 3.1.3 ,and with all the advantages of the 4.x ( folders, ibooks, faster maps, faster jawa, geo-tagging new caracters for notes, easier copy paste ((i think...)), etc. deffinatley a good option to upgrade! you will not be sorry!!!\n\nA: My wife's 3GS which has 3.1.3 runs much faster than my 3GS with 4.3.5(BL1). However I cannot backup her unit in newly purchased MacBook Pro with Lion, but I can backup mine. I see it as Apple's way to force us to upgrade to their latest iOS even if that means to sacrifice performance.

{"text": "Q: Concisely starting Mac OS apps from the command line I do a fair amount of work in the command line, and I find myself defining a lot of aliases of the form:\nalias skim='/Applications/Skim.app/Contents/MacOS/Skim'\n\nIs there a way to add magic such that asking for executable \"foo\" automatically uses executable /Applications/Foo.app/Contents/MacOS/Foo? This is on OS X 10.6.\n(I'm aware that I could do open foo.pdf, but Skim is not the default PDF reader, and I'd like a general solution - in some cases, it's not appropriate to set the application in question as the default handler for the file.)\n\nA: You don't need anything fancy, you already have the answer.  Try:\nopen /Applications/Foo.app bar.pdf\non edit\nIn light of the comments below, I think my answer would still be relatively similar... I would make a function that overrides open, does a pushd to /Applications, calls /usr/bin/open $appName.app $args, does a popd and returns.\nI suck at shell scripting but something like below which covers special cases and keeps you using pretty much the same syntax as apple provided for open.  I like to keep my environment as clean as possible.\nI'm sure the syntax is from outer space:\nfunction open($appName, $args)\n{\n    #if we are calling open without a path like /Applications/TextEdit.app AND\n    #    $appName ends in '.app'\n    if (!hasParent($appName) && isApp($appName))\n    {\n        pushd /Applications\n        /usr/bin/open ${appName}.app $args &\n        popd\n        return\n    }\n    #otherwise, use open as normal\n    /usr/bin/open $appName $args\n    return\n}\n\non second edit\nlooking @mankoff's comment on the original question, most of the stuff in the above function would probably be a waste of time since you could just use open -a $appName.  So mankoff probably has the easiest solution and should change his comment to an answer ;)\n\nA: There are two solutions that I can think of:\nThe easier way - Using the Info.plist file in each .app Contents directory, create an index of the value for the keys CFBundleExecutable.  Then add a short alias that calls a script (perl, python, whatever) with the name of an executable and the arguments you'd like to pass.  \nYour index would be pairs of executable names and paths to those executables.  You'd have to write a recurring scheduled script to keep this updated.\nYou'd end up being able to call:\nf foo file.txt\n\nwhere f is an alias to a script that checks your index for an executable named foo.\nAll in all, not a lot of work to get the functionality you'd like.\nThe harder way - Extend your shell to supplement the handling of its command_not_found error.  Essentially you would implement a Ruby style method_missing functionality within whatever shell you're using.  When command_not_found was thrown, your method would check the executable names of your installed Applications.\n\nA: Applescript to the rescue:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"iTunes\"' -e \"activate\" -e 'end tell'\n\nReplace the name of the application with the application you want to start and you're done. You can of course make it a shell function if needed:\nfunction f() {\n    osascript <<EOF\ntell application \"$1\"\n  activate\nend tell\nEOF\n}\n\nand use it that way:\nf iTunes\n\nI hate applescript, but it is useful sometimes, and I believe the only way to address an application simply by name on the command line. Everything else will require a full path.\n\nA: Finally I got it:\nAdd this to your .bash_profile\nfunction foomagick() {\n    rm -f ~/.foomagick.tmp\n    ls /Applications/ | grep \"\\.app\" | grep -v iWork | while read APP; do\n        # clean it up                                                           \n        a=`echo $APP | sed s/\\ //g`;\n        a=`echo $a | sed s/\\'//g`;\n        echo alias ${a%.*}=\"'open -a \\\"${APP%.*}\\\"'\" >> ~/.foomagick.tmp\n    done\n    source ~/.foomagick.tmp\n    rm ~/.foomagick.tmp  \n}\nfoomagick()\n\nNow the following work:\nSkim # open Skim.app\nSkim foo.pdf\nFireFox http://google.com\nFireFox google.com # ERROR. Looks for local file.\n\nEdit by Reid:\nI implemented the above as a Python script that makes wrapper scripts instead of aliases. You will need to put ~/bin/mankoffmagic in your path. If you want the wrappers to be updated automatically, run it regularly from cron or somesuch.\n#!/usr/bin/python\n#\n# This script automagically updates a set of wrapper shell scripts in\n# ~/bin/mankoffmagic which call Mac apps installed in /Applications.\n#\n# Inspired by mankoff's shell alias posted on apple.stackexchange.com; see:\n# http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4240/concisely-starting-mac-os-apps-from-the-command-line/4257#4257\n#\n# Notes/Bugs:\n#\n# 1.

{"text": "Q: Should I Do Anything Extra to Protect IPhone After Going to Beach? My friend told me that the salt in the air on the beach will reduce the lifespan of iPhone. \nIs it true? If yes, is there anything I can do to \"clean up\" the salt in my iPhone?\n\nA: I think your friend is confusing sea shanties with reality.  What old mariners call \"salt air\" is really just the smell of decaying seaweed and dead fish.\nSalt, being a solid crystal, can't evaporate, so if there's any \"salt in the air\" it would be in the form of salt rocks flying around.  I imagine that's probably a lot less likely than \"sand in the air\", since there's typically not a lot of unsequestered salt at the beach.  Also, I put salt crystals in glass all the time (e.g., measuring cups), and have yet to see the salt scratch the glass at all, so I think the chances of this hypothetical \"salt in the air\" causing damage to an iPhone are practically nonexistent.\nI would worry more about a seagull pooping on it.\n\nA: Well, you iPhone is pretty well sealed.  Unless you dropped the thing in the sand or ocean, you can probably just clean the outside with some safe cleaning product. (i.e. all purpose pledge, works for electronics, just spray onto rag first, then wipe phone).\n\nA: While its true that cars and many other metal objects will rust faster near the ocean, the salt is hardly relevant for your iPhone unless you plan on leaving it exposed on the beach for a few months straight.\nThe oils/sweat from your hands and the general movements in and out of your bag/pocket/etc will clean up the minute amount of residual salt that might be on it (:\nOn top of that, I'm pretty sure its well sealed enough that, unless you actually had water spray directly on it or dropped it in the ocean, the insides will be fine and salt free.\nFinally, the metal on the outside is stainless steel, which is very resistant to rust...\nIn short, \"she'll be right mate\".\n(The first gen iPhones did have speaker/mic holes in the case that were perfectly sized to trap sand in the holes and you'd lose volume/clarity, but that's about the only real beach worry I can think of, and not an issue from the 3G onwards with their finer mesh on the speaker/mic).\n\nA: Put the iphone in an unlubed condom.

{"text": "Q: Why won't my iPod Touch play in Bose SoundDock speakers anymore? I have owned and enjoyed the Bose SoundDock speakers for a number of years; during this time it has worked great with my iPod Mini, Video iPod, and iPod Touch. The speakers have an iPod dock that you seat the iPod in and the audio is played through the speaker.\nThese speakers predate the iPod Touch by many years and won't recharge the iPod Touch when plugged in. That's fine, I mention it because whenever I plug in the iPod Touch into the speakers the iPod Touch shows a message that recharging isn't supported.\nRecently, when I dock my iPod Touch in the speakers the warning that it can't recharge comes up, but no sound is played through the speakers. Instead, the iPod Touch's existing speakers play the music. Plugging in my Video iPod still works as expected - the sound comes out of the Bose speakers.\nI've tried undocking and redocking, wiggling it once docked, and so on, but I am unable to get the iPod Touch to play through the Bose speakers. Any idea what's going on here? This is frustrating since I use these speakers quite often...\nEDIT: Some further clarifications. My iPod Touch is a 2nd-gen iPod Touch (if that matters). It is, and has for some time, running software version 4.1. I have not tried updating to 4.2 or restoring the iPod's original settings. Also, the speakers continue to work with my iPod Video, so I'm pretty certain the problem lies somewhere with the iPod Touch and not the speakers themselves.\n\nA: Since it\u2019s practically impossible to diagnose a problem like this without physical access to the iPod and the SoundDock, I\u2019m going to give you a few ideas of what I\u2019d try to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have access to another iPod, try that of course, if that works, we\u2019ve found a problem with your particular iPod.\n\n*If you have access to another SoundDock\u2026 well, put your iPod in those and see if the problem lies in your SoundDock.\n\n*Since the last two were two obvious (and you probably thought about them), let me tell you that you can go to an Apple Store with both devices and try the above combinations there. I\u2019m sure that you will find another SoundDock in an Apple Store to try your iPod and that they also have iPods so you can try your Sound Dock. It doesn\u2019t hurt to ask.\n\n*In any case, the remaining obvious alternative is to restore the iPod, either to factory settings (and later using a backup) or to restore a backup (so you don\u2019t lose everything).\n\n*The final idea, is to try 4.2, but that should be the last step. You don\u2019t want 4.2 to introduce new \u201cundiscovered\u201d problems on top of your old problem. \n\n\nSadly, there isn\u2019t much else we can do from here. The can\u2019t charge or incompatible device message is \u201cok\u201d most of the time (I had that problem too with a car adapter), but it worked anyway. \nI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t come up with a better idea.\n Just had this same problem... I fixed it by spraying a Contact Cleaner on my Ipod/ITouch.. and it works after... sometimes, Dust or Dirt will cause bad connection between the Unit and the Sound Dock Port *\n\nA: This happened after I got my IPhone 4S.  I made my IPhone 3G an IPod Touch and it played fine on the Bose Docking Speaker( I got the same pop up that said it wouldn't support recharging.  But then today it just stopped playing Pandora.

Unplug the Bose unit from the wall and plug it back in. \nGood Luck, mine's working again. \n\nA: It might be useful to update to software version 4.2; that worked for my iPod Touch. \nIf that doesn't work, or introduces new problems, you can always revert to the old version of software. \nMy mom also had a similar problem, we tried upgrading the software but it didn't make any difference. \nFinally, I looked in the docking point on the iPod Touch (on the bottom, where you dock it) and it was a little coated in dust, I just blew on it and then tried plugging it in again, it worked.\nIf none of these things worked, try calling the Bose tech support! It's free and I've found them quite helpful.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my iPhone until I took of the protective case, then it seated in the dock just fine and I could play though the speakers.\n\nA: There is a solution.\nI have the same problem - my old iPod video charges & plays fine through the SoundDock, but my iPod Touch 4th gen and iPhone 4 both play but do not charge.\nI have spoken to Apple and Bose separately, and they both said Bose can replace the docks' connector for an updated one that has a different pin configuration. They said this will allow the dock to play and charge all current Apple iPod/iPhone products. However, It costs \u00a379 to do this.  Not cheap, but better than having a redundant item gathering dust.\nJust contact Bose directly (number on their website) and have the serial number of the SoundDock to hand, or take your SoundDock to an Apple store and they will sort it out for you (it will still cost \u00a379)\nHope this helps.\nSean.\n\nA: I unplugged the speakers from the wall and tried it again, which seems to have fixed my issue.\n\nA: It's the software. My new iPhone doesn't work on the Bose dock. My old iPhone worked fine with the Bose until I updated the software.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4265", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: AirPlay for 3rd Party apps The experience I see thus far for AirPlay with 3rd party apps, on both iPhone and iPad, is that only the audio is output to the AppleTV but not the video. This is great for Pandora but not so good for any video app. Is this a bug with AirPlay or do the developers need to update their apps to support it properly?\n\nA: According to John Gruber, this is not possible, unfortunately:\n\nAirPlay is the killer feature for Apple TV. But perhaps we\u2019d better keep that in the future tense for now: it\u2019s going to be the killer feature for Apple TV. After installing today\u2019s various software updates for iOS devices, the only apps I\u2019ve seen where AirPlay works for video are the built-in iPod app (a.k.a. \u201cVideo\u201d on the iPad and iPod Touch) and YouTube. In other apps, AirPlay is audio-only.\n\n\nA: Word from the future: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniPhoneOS/Articles/iOS4_3.html\nYou'll note right up top that it's now totally possible for 3rd-party apps to spit video over AirPlay (as of iOS 4.3; been this way for some time now.).\n\nA: Jobs stated in an email it will be available in 2011:\n\nQ: [...] I just purchased\n  Apple TV and was wondering are you\n  ever going to make airplay video work\n  for videos in safari and 3rd party\n  apps? [...]\nA: Yep, hope to add these features to\n  Airplay in 2011.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4266", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}
{"text": "Q: What are my options for full system (or at least home directory) encryption? I own a MacBook Pro, which is obviously a Laptop, so I want to protect myself in case it ever gets stolen.\nOn Windows I can use TrueCrypt to do a full system encryption, but would that also be a choice on Mac OS X?\nI think that OS X contains a built-in encryption, but when it was released (10.2? 10.3?) I heard it had some really bad flaws that made it unusable.\nIs that still the case? What are my options to encrypt either the full drive or at least my home directory?\n\nA: Mac OS X comes with FileVault for encrypting your home directory. There isn't a whole lot of customization for it, but it does its job. There are a few downsides, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*FileVault does not play well with Time Machine backups. Time Machine can only back up the FileVault encrypted disk image when the user is logged out.\n\n*As FileVault runs it tends to slowly consume disk space. This space is reclaimed at logout, but it can cause problems if your drive is nearly full.\nThese downsides are the result of FileVault being implemented as an encrypted disk image that is then mounted at login. However, as long as you make sure you regularly log out of your machine they shouldn't present that much of an issue.\nIt does appear that TrueCrypt is available for Mac OS X, but I've never used it and don't know how well it works.\n\nA: PGP whole-disk encryption supports OS X (10.5 and 10.6, Intel CPUs only), including the boot disk.  \n\nA: The new Mac OS Lion supports whole disk encryption with the new Filevault2.\n\nA: According to http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/sys-encryption-supported-os you can't use TrueCrypt to encrypt the OS partition on macs. No idea whether it can encrypt the user directory.\n\nA: truecrypt 7.0a works like a champ on os x 10.6.6.  It even works with etoken pro 64k!  You can encrypt any container (basically like a disk image).  However, I don't see any way to get it to encrypt the user directory.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4268", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

I will attach some images to illustrate the issue. My photo library was updated and seems to work. I have also tried closing all apps, which did not help.\n\n\n\n\nA: I am speculating, that this is what happened: I did the update on another computer (not the one my music is synced to), which invalidated the copy protection of my music library, so when I plugged my phone back into the machine where my music library is stored it did the deed for me. That is what seems to have happened anyway.\n\nA: While Martin's answer is correct to bring back the songs, but here the songs are not lost/ disappeared from iPhone. There is a way to fix this. \nAfter upgrading to 4.2.1, the songs are still there, but by somehow the songs are not shown in iPod.app. All I did is plug-in the headphones and click the middle button to play the songs. And it did worked.\nNo need to re-sync the songs.\n\nA: To add to your own answer, you will have to re-sync with your library or reset some contents (via the correct iTunes).\n\nA: found the answer with the second suggestion here.\n\nA: Re-start touch (Hold home and off/on buttons) and sync again with iTunes, bingo!\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4270", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: I have a 2009 MacBook Air, bought a year ago - will I notice much of a performance improvement if I buy the latest version (Late 2010)? Does the SSD make that much difference? The processor is not much beefier, what are the other factors I should consider/which have an impact? Anyone made the same upgrade and happy with a significant improvement? Or am I just wanting a new shiny thing?\n\nA: The flash storage makes a huge difference (a fresh system boots in about 15 seconds, apps will start instantly etc.), and the new MBA does not need to throttle the CPU when it gets hot. So you will probably notice a big improvement.

With IOS 4.2, they have enabled the remote wipe ability for all iphone4 users via MobileME. So at least, if you lose your phone, you can have it wiped out remotely.\n\nA: According to an article on Yahoo News, there are known exploits for Apple's keychain, which would allow an attacker to gain access to passwords stored on the iPhone.

{"text": "Q: Is there a Mac OS X Terminal version of the \"free\" command in Linux systems? On Linux, I often use the free command to see the current amount of free and used memory in the system. For example:\n$ free\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       7264256    1010952    6253304          0     371892     189088\n-/+ buffers/cache:     449972    6814284\nSwap:      8126456         28    8126428\n\nIt does not seem to exist when I enter free in Mac OS X's Terminal. Is there an alternative?\n\nA: The command you need is vm_stat - similar to the traditional Unix tool vmstat but with a few MACH-specific differences. The man page is well written.\n\nA: free=\"$(( $(vm_stat | awk '/free/ {gsub(/\\./, \"\", $3); print $3}') * 4096 / 1048576)) MiB free\"\n\n\nA: #!/bin/bash\ntop -l 1 | grep PhysMem: | awk '{print $10}'\n\n\nFor Unix experts only:\ntop -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem:/ {print $10}'\n\n\nA: It seems the reason it's slow is because top -l 1 always delays by one second after completing, the standard delay between refreshes.  Adding -s 0 to the command makes it complete instantly:\ntop -l 1 -s 0 | grep PhysMem\n\nAlso, for clarity, I like showing each mem-component on its line, so I added 9 spaces for alignment with 'PhysMem: ' in the sed replacement string:\ntop -l 1 -s 0 | grep PhysMem | sed 's/, /\\n         /g'\n\n\nA: Judging by your other question, I think you've found the use of the Activity Monitor utility to look at your memory status, right?  Just for the record, it's in /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app.\n\nA: You might try the command allmemory if you want a command line tool that reports extremely detailed memory usage.\n\nA: The above is way too much effort for my liking, and it assumes that you have a fully fledged install too... If you've booted from a Mac OS X start up disk, then all the above solutions obviously won't work...\nJust use the command \"hostinfo\", here's the output from my mid 2012 MBAir running Mavericks (10.9.1):\n Mach kernel version:\n Darwin Kernel Version 13.0.0: Thu Sep 19 22:22:27 PDT 2013; root:xnu-2422.1.72~6/RELEASE_X86_64\nKernel configured for up to 4 processors.\n2 processors are physically available.\n4 processors are logically available.\nProcessor type: i486 (Intel 80486)\nProcessors active: 0 1 2 3\nPrimary memory available: 8.00 gigabytes\nDefault processor set: 195 tasks, 961 threads, 4 processors\nLoad average: 1.61, Mach factor: 2.38\n\nThe good this about this command is that it comes preinstalled with the 10.9 installer too under /usr/bin, so it's very handy, \nideally, if you just want RAM then issue:\n$ hostinfo | grep memory\n\nDon't know if hostinfo exists on any previous OSes though...\n\nA: Here's a simple one-liner to make the whole vm_stat output more human friendly:\n$ vm_stat | perl -ne '/page size of (\\d+)/ and $size=$1; /Pages\\s+([^:]+)[^\\d]+(\\d+)/ and printf(\"%-16s % 16.2f Mi\\n\", \"$1:\", $2 * $size / 1048576);'\nfree:                     2330.23 Mi\nactive:                   2948.07 Mi\ninactive:                 1462.97 Mi\nspeculative:               599.45 Mi\nwired down:                840.46 Mi\ncopy-on-write:           43684.84 Mi\nzero filled:            385865.48 Mi\nreactivated:               608.14 Mi\n\n\nA: top -l 1 -s 0 | awk ' /Processes/ || /PhysMem/ || /Load Avg/{print}'\n\nThis should do nicely :)\n\nA: I think these days, psutil and its meminfo.py script provide the most helpful memory-usage details. To try it:\npip install psutil\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giampaolo/psutil/master/scripts/meminfo.py\npython ./meminfo.py\n\nThe output it produces looks like this:\nMEMORY\n------\nTotal      :   16.0G\nAvailable  :    5.5G\nPercent    :    65.8\nUsed       :   13.5G\nFree       :    1.5G\nActive     :    7.4G\nInactive   :    4.0G\nWired      :    2.1G\n\nSWAP\n----\nTotal      :    1.0G\nUsed       :   33.5M\nFree       :  990.5M\nPercent    :     3.3\nSin        :   15.9G\nSout       :   71.6M\n\nNotice the Available row, which shows an estimate  of  how  much  memory  is actually available for starting new applications, without swapping.\nI don\u2019t know of any other MacOS utility providing that available-memory estimate.\nFor the sake of comparison: On a Linux system, the same sort of information is provided in the available column in output from current versions of free:\n              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\nMem:           7.8G        552M        182M        156M        7.1G        6.9G\nSwap:            0B          0B          0B\nTotal:         7.8G        552M        182M\n\nThat available column in free output just comes from MemAvailable in /proc/meminfo. And on systems that have /proc/meminfo, psutil also just uses that to estimate available memory.\nBut MacOS doesn\u2019t have /proc/meminfo, so to estimate the available memory in that case,  psutil employs the same algorithm used on Linux to calculate MemAvailable for /proc/meminfo.\n\nA: In case you're only really interested in swap usage (what would be the last line of output from free):\n$ sysctl vm.swapusage\nvm.swapusage: total = 64.00M  used = 0.00M  free = 64.00M  (encrypted)\n\n\nA: Bash commands \"free like\" for Mac OSX.\nThis is the second reissue of this post. At first, I got two -1. One because I was not describing in English, it is corrected. The other because I used gawk (which is not part of a standard OS X installation), it is also corrected, I now use awk. The -2 are still there ;-). The best is perhaps now to test and evaluate the commands it themselves?\nI reviewed my first idea to build only one end-user oriented command with a friendly and highly configurable display, I made two:\n\n\n*\n\n*free-like.sh a script always oriented \"end user\", with more accuracy, a \"friendly\" and configurable display, but with more calculations and resource consumption,\n\n*free-like-raw.sh, a command now oriented developer, sysadmin, etc.., with less computation and resource consumption, but also with less precision, less  \"friendly\" display.\nThe data for the physical memory are extracted from the results of the command vm_stat (which returns the results in blocksize). The imprecision resulting from the transformation in bytes (number_of_blocks * block_size, the default value of the calculations) will be between 0 < the size of the block.\nThe data for virtual memory are taken from the top command. The imprecision here is linked to the unit of reference of the top command: kilo, mega, giga.\nCalculations are made using awk that respects rounded (as opposed to bc). awk is also quicker than bc.\nYou can see the test script here: http://myblog.robert.sebille.name/article29.html#awk-bc\nYou can view the results of the commands in bytes (default), in kilo, mega or giga, with x decimal places in the case of free-like.sh and if you ask the display in mega ou giga.\nThe scripts are too long for a post, but you can find them on this article of my blog: http://myblog.robert.sebille.name/article29.html\nThe article is in french, but it display one example of display for each command and their integrated help (./free-like.sh -h and ./free-like-raw.sh -h), in english. These aids completely describe the commands. The article display also the codes. \nEnglish is not my mother language.

{"text": "Q: What does it mean if I have lots of \"Inactive\" memory at the end of a work day? After a day's of work at my MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.5, Activity Monitor shows that the majority of my computer's 8 GB of memory is \"Inactive\", and only a tiny sliver of the pie chart is \"Free\". This is even when I have closed all applications, with only the Finder running.\nWhat does that mean? Is the \"Inactive\" memory taken up by something? Or is it actually still available for applications to use? Thanks.\n\nA: This is most likely not a problem, and in fact is potentially speeding up your computer.\nAll (most?) operating systems utilise a Disk Cache, which stores some recently accessed files in memory so that repeated access of those files can be sped up. The disk cache on OS X is variable in size, and will appear as \"Inactive Memory\" being used.\nIf any program needs more memory, OS X will clear some of the disk cache (the least recently used files) to allow space for the program to run/expand.\nI find that if I do a lot of compiling or photo-sorting (i.e. accessing thousands of files in succession) the disk cache will expand and use a lot of Inactive Memory. Provided its just this disk cache, its nothing to worry about.\nIf it is a background process or application that is expanding in its memory usage (but its pages are being marked inactive) then you'll be able to tell by checking for any programs with very high \"Real Memory\" usage in Activity Monitor. If there's nothing obviously large there (i.e. the total is a long way short of 8GB) then it'll be the file cache.\nYou should see that there's little if any Swap usage, and if you open a memory-intensive program the amount of inactive memory will decrease without having to swap to disk.\n(I believe there was a bug in 10.4 or 10.5 for a while where it wouldn't always free up this memory very effectively, and would cause swapping despite having a large disk cache, but in my experience this appears solved in 10.6).\n\nA: \"Inactive\" memory is available for use by other programs -- it's just caching programs or data that you recently used, in case you need them again.  If you launch different programs or need different data, the cached memory will cleared and made available to your new workload as needed.\nThat's the theory, at any rate, and I believe it to be sound.  However, I did find this reference to a \"purge\" utility someone wrote because they didn't think inactive memory was being released quickly enough.\nFor official documentation on the subject, read this (and search for \"inactive\").\n\nA: OS X, like most modern operating systems, uses a virtual memory system for managing memory. Among other purposes, this allows the operating system to treat the computer as having an unlimited pool of memory. To achieve this, the OS will page unused parts of RAM out to a disk store known as the swapfile.\nOf course, RAM is not unlimited, so OS X groups RAM into four categories: wired, active, inactive, and free. Wired memory is required by the operating system, and can never be paged out of memory. Active memory is memory used by currently-running programs. Inactive memory was used recently by programs which have now been terminated (or haven't been unused in a long time). Free memory is, as the name suggests, RAM that is not being used.\nWhen you launch a program, it gets loaded into active memory. When you quit a program, however, it doesn't get removed from RAM; rather, it gets bumped into inactive memory. This is why it is often faster to re-launch a program -- it is still in RAM (try this with a big program like Firefox).\nOnce all your memory is used (free memory is 0), the OS will write out inactive memory to the swapfile to make more room in active memory.\nIf a program gets paged out to the swapfile, and you re-launch it, it'll get pulled from the swapfile into active memory.\nSo in short, you actually shouldn't care if your free memory is low. In fact, you want it to be low -- free memory is wasted memory (as the OS isn't using it for anything).\nWhen examining how much memory your computer is using, you actually want to pay attention mostly to Swap used, which tells you the size of the virtual memory swapfile, and Page ins, which tells you how often the OS has to pull memory from the swapfile into active memory.\n\nA: Starting with OS X 10.5 there are evident memory management problems in MAC OS X. \nI finally managed to reproduce the problematic scenario, so i run the test and recorded the screen, into video.\nMAC OS X Lion performance problem - broken memory management\nI run the tar+bzip command, which is basic unix stuff, on the large amount of picture files, in my Pictures/ folder. Just before start, i run the \"purge\" command, to delete inactive/cached program data.\nYou can see on the video that free memory starts to drop very fast, and inactive is constantly rising. If you take a look at \"bsdtar\" command, it takes only a fragment of RAM, so the problem is not in this process. You cannot say that it is a program memory leak, because then the problem would not be in inactive ram, rather in active/wired.\nWhen the free memory dropped below 100mb, i started some apps, like Safari, iPhoto and MS Word, and you can see in the video, that it takes even minutes to start an app, when normally (when there is free RAM), it would take some 3-5 secs to load.\nI run the same scenario and the same commands on my Linux Centos 6 box, no problem there ! Memory usage is some 10-20mb, no problems with cache/buffer.\nThe memory management must be very broken in Mac OS X !\n\nA: This discussion makes sense only if the statement that \"your computer will run faster when free memory is low\" - were true.  Unless my Desktop Mac is wired weird, the minute my free memory (monitored) starts getting low, whatever program I am running at the time starts to bog down to the point where I can't do anything until it moves back up by itself or by my Free Memory intervention.  I have an iMac 2118 (2006 or later) that maxes out at 3 GB RAM so I try to manage it when I can but this is very frustrating.

{"text": "Q: What is the Steam gaming platform? \n*\n\n*What is Steam?  \n\n*Why should I buy the game on Steam instead from normal retailer? \n\n*Can a game bought via Steam played independently?\n\n\nA: What is Steam?\nAccording to them, they are  The Ultimate Online Game Platform. What this actually means is that they are a portal for you to buy, play and update games. With certain benefits. But \u201csteam\u201d is just that. They sell games (more on this later), they offer you a community where you can have Friends, Chat with them, unlock achievements, etc. If you\u2019re a user of an iPhone/Pod/Pad that has GameCenter in it, think of Steam as a pseudo GameCenter.\nWhy Steam and not normal retailer?\nThe advantages of Steam are a few, and I couldn\u2019t list them all because some things may not be better for everybody, but let\u2019s just say that the strength of the platform and what makes it different from buying a boxed game could be summarized in a few bullets (in no particular order):\n\n\n*\n\n*Very easy to buy a game (and discover new ones)\n\n*Instant buy, start downloading, no delivery costs.\n\n*Automatic updates without having to worry\n\n*If you buy a game on your Macintosh and one day decide to play it on your Windows computer, provided that the game is supported in that Platform, you can continue your game there, as if nothing has happened. You re-download the game in your Windows machine and voil\u00e1.\n\n*Friends, Achivements, Progress\u2026 Steam as a platform sports game achievements that you unlock by playing.\n\n*Discounts, sometimes you will get \u201ccheaper\u201d versions of the games or promos that you can take advantage of. \n\n*More, I\u2019m sure there are other advantages but think of an AppStore for games with a plus. \n\n\nCan games be played independently?\nYes and no. I don\u2019t believe you can copy that game over another machine (tho you could probably install steam on that machine and copy the game\u2026 I haven\u2019t tried this). But you can play offline if you don\u2019t have Internet. \nBonus: Is it worth?\nIf you have a Mac and like gaming, it\u2019s definitely a big plus, as a lot of games get ported and put into the Steam network. If you\u2019re in Windows, I believe the ease of use and \u201cpoint and click\u201d nature of the service make it worth. And also the fact that you don\u2019t have to pay to use it. Did I mention it\u2019s a free service? ;)\nBut Does it have Cons?\nSome invaluable readers pointed out a few cons, which I will update (and I encourage everybody to contribute):\n\n\n*\n\n*When you start it, it automatically updates, giving you the sensation that the client is hang. Also if your network speed is not optimal, this process can demand a lot of time.\n\n*If your network connection is not good, downloading three gigabytes of game might not be the best idea, given that you usually can\u2019t start playing until almost most (if not all) the content is downloaded. \n\n*In order to play offline, you have to log in, and tell steam \u201cI\u2019m going offline\u201d, which kind of voids the possibility of an unexpected loss of connectivity or forgetting to do it before disconnecting for example. \n\n*I didn\u2019t mention this, but it\u2019s important to note that not all the Windows games are available on Steam and not all work on OS X. Although decent amount (and growing) catalog is available, not every title is there. \n\n\nUPDATE: There\u2019s a dedicating gaming community in Stack Exchange for that. Don\u2019t hesitate asking gaming questions there too, those guys may seem like gamers, but they aren\u2019t playing at all ;) \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4304", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}
{"text": "Q: Relative performance of 2006 Mac Pro and 2007 iMac I'm trying to evaluate a purchase but am having trouble finding apples-to-apples performance comparisons for these two machines.  A year and and many details separate them.  Are there any common benchmarks that consider disk and graphics performance?  Which is preferable for software development (dual-head, but otherwise light on the GPU)?\nMac Pro (2006) [Detailed specs]\n\n\n*\n\n*Two dual-core Xeon processors at 2.66GHz (1.33GHz bus)\n\n*3GB RAM\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce 7300 GT with 256 MB RAM\n\n\niMac (2007) [Detailed specs]\n\n\n*\n\n*Core 2 Duo (obviously dual-core) at 2.4GHz (800MHz bus)\n\n*3GB RAM\n\n*ATI Radeon 2600 with 256 MB RAM\n\n\nBoth machines have their original hard drives (SATA).\nThanks in advance for your input.\n\nA: Your question is somewhat difficult to answer, because not all is based upon \u201craw\u201d performance.\nI\u2019d say that it would be better if you consider the following differences:\nRAM\n\n\n*\n\n*MP(MacPro): Very easy to add and the limit is probably higher than what you can/Want to afford for the task you want to perform. Adding 8-12GB is probably \u201ccheap\u201d.\n\n*iM(iMac): Probably more limited, tho not harder to change as far as I can remember, but if you need 12 GB you can\u2019t achieve that with that (or any AFAICR) iMac.\n\n\nHARD DRIVES\n\n\n*\n\n*MP: Although \u201cexternal\u201d drives are \u201cok\u201d, having four internal SATA bays is godsend. Very easy to add/remove drives and to create a simple RAID1 if you wanna have a mirror \u201cjust in case\u201d. \n\n*iM: close to impossible (unless you have the right tools, time, patience and dedication) to change the internal drive, which is a \u201cslower\u201d 2.5 drive if I am not mistaken. Some \u201chacks\u201d exist to replace the superdrive with another drive, but I don\u2019t know if that Model fits. \n\n\nVideo\n\n\n*\n\n*MP: Tho I don\u2019t know if the NVIDA is better than that particular ATI (tho I believe it is), the expandability of the MP is superior to the zero expandability of the iMac. You could add more cards to your MacPro for more than two displays if that\u2019s what you want. But you have to get your own displays\u2026\n\n*iM: Zero. You can\u2019t change or add another video card. You\u2019re stuck with a very nice 24 inch display and an integrated iSight. The MacPro, will need displays (and webcams). The CONS here is that if you don\u2019t like Glossy Displays\u2026 you\u2019re out of luck :)\n\n\nRAM Speed, Bus Speed, etc\nAll these things don\u2019t really change your day to day workflow, yes, some Front Side Buses are faster than others, but in the end, the difference is probably not a decision factor. (given similar specs of course).\nConnectivity\n\n\n*\n\n*Both machines have enough USB/FW ports I believe, tho the Mac Pro surely has some more, you will need more ports in the iMac if you use external drives (not that you have much choice there). \n\n\nSo which one do I chose?\nThe answer is, there\u2019s no answer. You have to evaluate your priorities. I wouldn\u2019t change my Mac Pro (early 2008) for a new iMac, because I already have two 27\u2019\u2019 screens, already have 4 drives in there (with some RAID going on) + an SSD for the OS and I have replaced the stock video card (NVIDIA) with an ATI (because my nVidia Failed and the ATI costed the same as the out of warranty nVIdia). My Mac Pro is going to turn 3 years soon and it works fantastically.\nThe iMac on the other hand, is a beautiful looking machine that if you use paired with a lot of BlueTooth stuff, makes your desk look very pristine. Sadly, I need storage, redundancy and multi-core for some of the things I do for a living, so the 8 cores of my Mac Pro are needed in my case. \nI notice that the MultiCore is godsend sometimes, you see processes hanging there at 100% and the rest of the CPUs and cores take care. But of course, a normal World of Warcraft user wouldn\u2019t even use 5% of all that. \nI suggest you visit Anandtech\u2019s Mac section if you want some benchmarks and reviews. It\u2019s usually filled with good impressions and comments and sometimes comparisons. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll find an exact comparison between those two models, but you might come up with something similar. \nMy Personal Opinion\nGet the Mac Pro if you\u2019re going to develop and already have screens (or the budget to buy them), because in the future, when you want your time machine, your drive cloned, more space, etc., the Mac Pro is going to be much more helpful than stacking fragile external Firewire/USB drives. \nUPDATE ON VIDEO\nAccording to the experts (tegeril), the \u201cATI 2600 Pro is a substantially superior card to the Nvidia 7300GT\u201d. You\u2019ll have to find some benchmarking for that and of course evaluate if you\u2019re going to need the extra power or the expandability is better. \n\nA: There's a Mac-specific set of benchmarks called Xbench.  If you have access to both machines, you can run it on them and see how they stack up.\nIf not, there's an online database at db.xbench.com, and there are probably other places around you can find Xbench scores.\nHere's a couple that are pretty close to yours, though running different versions of Mac OS (not sure how much that matters):\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac, 2.4GHz, 3GB RAM\n\n*MacPro, 2.66GHz, 3GB RAM\nIn this particular matchup, it's pretty even.  The Xeon wins on threading (not surprising), while the iMac wins on hard disk (surprising, to me) -- though as Martin noted, it's easy to add more or better disks to a MacPro.\nThe decision probably comes down to form-factor, as much as anything else.  Obviously people have been developing software on machines far slower than either of these for decades.\n\nA: Also don't for get to check out Geekbench results. I find their results very valuable in determining overall system performance. FYI EveryMac.com has the average Geekbench results posted for almost every mac that can run the benchmark. \n\n\n\nApple iMac \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.4 24-Inch (Al) Geekbench result\nApple Mac Pro \"Quad Core\" 2.66 (Original) Geekbench result\nIn this case for raw performance the Mac Pro wins this contest hands down, go with the Mac Pro. I actually have the same Mac Pro, and it runs very well and was a very productive upgrade from a MacBook\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4311", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

Specifically, one that works on the iPad.\n\nA: Neither iOS Safari nor Opera Mini support this option. However, you can install the 'view source' iOS bookmarklet, as explained here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://fettig.net/weblog/2007/07/02/view-source-for-safari-on-iphone/\nAnd use it to look for the image link within the source you are visiting.\nThis may be cumbersome using older iOS versions, but it is much easier on iOS 4.2, using the 'Find text on webpages' feature which allows you to search for text using Safari's Search field (right of the navigation bar) to look for image extensons like .jpg, .png and .gif.\n\nA: Tap, and hold the image; then choose \"copy,\" open a new browser window, and paste into the address bar.\n\nA: Tap and hold, and the 2nd option will be to open it in a new page.  Tap that, and you'll get a new window.  Tap the URL bar, and Copy.\n\nA: [Note: this has only been tested on iOS 5.1.1 on iPad]\nFor a simple image, you can tap-and-hold it and select 'Copy'. This will copy the URL of the image which you can paste wherever you need it.\nHowever, when the image is being used as a link to another URL, this method copies the linked URL only.\nA method that always works is to use the Show Images Bookmarklet (from here - a useful resource any time you want a bookmarklet on iOS).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4312", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "9"}}

Is there a way to remove the preview icon of a gif or jpeg file ?\nI made very little image file for the web, but they weight 45 Ko ! I guess this comes from the preview icons\nEdit : I've added a screenshot to show you the informations i've got. Preview.app seems to be the most accurate...\n\nAs you can see, i used 3 ways to get the size information : \n\n\n*\n\n*from the finder, in the folder himself (45 ko)\n\n*from the Get Info dialog box (45 ko)\n\n*from the preview.app, General Info Box (0,5 Ko)\n\n\nA: As mankoff said, the large size is probably a resource fork (with things like previews).

If want to compact the file anyway, use the command xattr -d com.apple.ResourceFork /Volumes/Database/WebFolder/imgs/confirm.gif to remove the fork.\n\nA: The Finder preview data isn't stored inside the actual file, so that's not what's causing your size problems.\nImageOptim is a handy GUI tool for shrinking excess data. Also, if you're making a small image I'd recommend png or gif, jpeg is designed for photos.\n\nA: Try deleting the resource fork. From the command line this could be:\ncp /dev/null file.ext/rsrc\n\nIf you want to explore the resource fork more, use the DeRez CLI tool (from Developer Tools) or Rezilla.app (GUI)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4345", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

I know that I can log out of the store on the iPad and then sign in with a new iTunes account to download apps on their own accounts - however I assume iTunes will give an error when connected to a different Mac/PC and require it to be wiped?\nI know lots of schools/businesses are deploying these and it seems unlikely that they're require so much manual work on the users part to get it working/syncing.\nI've taken a quick look at Apple's documentation on this, but a lot of it deals with enterprise security issues, which is not my concern: http://www.apple.com/ipad/business/resources/\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4347", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: What is the best way to modify Apple keyboards for alternate layouts? I would like to permanently modify my keyboard's button labels to match the non-default keyboard layout that I have set on an Apple computer, so that others who do not touch-type can use the keyboard.  How do I do this?\nI have the \"Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad (English)\".\nWhy?  I don't use the QWERTY layout on my US-bought Apple computer, and Apple does not sell anything except QWERTY keyboards.  This is not a problem for me, as I touch-type, so the labels on the keys are basically unused by me.  But other people (mostly children) use my computer, and I would like to allow them to \"hunt-and-peck\" with the system-wide keyboard layout.\nI have tried using stickers to \"relabel\" the keys, but this is obviously not very durable and looks terrible and makes it difficult to touch-type since it obscures the little nubs on the \"home keys\".  Most of the stickers have been worn off.\nI am willing to disassemble the keyboard and reassemble it if the keys are physically separate from each other.  But I am not willing to disassemble the keyboard to discover if this is true or not.  I have looked at several Mac \"tear down\" articles, but none of them illustrate the keyboard mechanism.  If I could simply re-arrange the existing buttons, I would have to remove the \"home key\" nubs on the \"F\" and \"J\" keys and add something to the \"U\" and \"H\" keys, but I think I can handle that.\nI am also willing to use paint and/or chemicals to modify the labels, but I know nothing about where to start here.  Are the labels painted on?  Or are they a different kind of plastic somehow injected into the button plastic?  Can I paint over the existing labels and then re-paint new ones?  Or would I have to somehow dye the keys to be some single color and then paint on my labels?  What would be a type of paint that is durable enough for a keyboard?\nI am not willing to buy a third-party keyboard, unless it is nearly exactly equivalent to the Apple keyboard.  I suppose I am willing to buy a second third-party keyboard and rotate them if that is simple to do with OS X.  But ideally, I want one keyboard with labels that match the default layout, and touch-typers can use whatever layout they want, and hunt-and-peckers can still make do.\nAre there any other options?\n\nA: If you have a keyboard similar to the one described here, it sounds like you can just pop the keys off and push them back down in the new position.\n\nA: Would one of the printed keyboard covers offered by companies like KBCovers do the job? \nSince you have not stated what the actual \"non-standard keyboard layout\" you are using consists of, it's hard for us to understand what you need.\nFurthermore, Apple does indeed sell keyboards in other layouts besides QWERTY. In the United States Apple Store, you can order an Apple keyboard layed out for US English, German, Belgian, Danish, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Swiss, Swedish, Norwegian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian and Arabic.\n\nA: I haven\u2019t disassembled an Apple Keyboard (aluminium) myself, but I know it\u2019s possible, albeit with a lot of complications to put it back. \nInstead, I suggest to find a \u201creal\u201d keyboard from This Epic Keyboard guide. Some keyboards will allow you to remove the keycaps. \nThe different keyboard mechanisms are explained there. Apple keyboards use the scissor switch mechanism, which is not 100% friendly to reassemble, but possible.\nAdditionally, in a direct response to your question, here is a nice review of the Apple keyboard which shows a picture of a key removed and the scissor mechanism so you know what to expect if you still want to pursue the operation.\nI guess the best way is to pull\u2026pull\u2026pull\u2026 (with caution) until the keys \u201cget lose\u201d. That\u2019s how I did it on a laptop with scissor mechanism that had a few failing keys. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4367", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: Why does changing \"Open with\" also change a files \"Modification date\"? Something I noticed a while ago. I use Carbon Copy Cloner for backing up my files and I noticed one day when I changed a video's \"Open with\" flag to always open a video file with Movist instead of Quicktime, and the next time the clone ran it copied the file again. Even though nothing was changed. Which made me realize that OS X changes changes a files modification date causing backup programs like Rsync (Which CCC and SuperDuper use) and Time Machine to re-copy the file, even if it's 10GB in size.\nWhy does it do this? Is there a technical reason or is it an oversight? Seems like a silly idea to me. Especially since changing a label doesn't modify the file and the color selection is duplicated without the whole file being copied.\n\nA: Some experimentation using the xattr command shows this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Label information is stored in the com.apple.FinderInfo extended attribute, which every file should have by default.\n\n*Custom application associations are stored in the com.apple.ResourceFork attribute, which not every file has.\n\n*Updating the FinderInfo attribute does not cause the modification date to be modified.\n\n*Creating/updating the ResourceFork causes the modification date to be modified.\n\n\nThe resource fork historically had a special place in Mac file systems. I'm not sure if the com.apple.ResourceFork extended attribute is the same as a resource fork, if the latter was superseded by the former or how else they are connected.\nIf there's a technical difference between an extended attribute and a resource fork, it may be \"necessary\" for a file to be modified when the resource fork is updated, but not when the extended attribute is written.\nIt may be that the (legacy) API for updating resource forks updates the file modification date in the process, while the extended attribute API doesn't. The latter possibly in error, possibly because of different philosophies.\nVague information, but it might give a little more insight. In the end though you're right. Some meta information modification causes the modification date to be updated, others doesn't. Whether there's a reason behind this or if it's just an oversight\u2026 only a few guys at Apple may know. :)\n\nA: When you select a single file, open a Get Info window, and choose a different, non-default application, this Launch Services binding is saved in the resource fork of the file itself, in a 'usro' (User Override) resource. As far as I know, the format of this resource is private, determined by Apple, and is subject to change. (The all lowercase characters in the OSType name provide a clue, since Apple reserves file type, creator codes and resource types with all lowercase characters. For example, 'icns' (Icon Suite) resource type, 'ttxt' (originally from Teach Text, but is now the creator code (CFBundleSignature) of TextEdit.app), etc.).\nThis resource is created using the Resource Manager functions to modify the fork of the file, which in turn updates the file's modification date.\nAn example file which I just tried this procedure on is shown in the image below, opened in Resorcerer. (Special note: you will notice in the left column that there are 2 types listed: 'TEXT' and 'usro'. There is in fact only a single 'usro' entry; Resorcerer is showing that there's a 'TEXT' resource entry because it notices the content in the file's data fork is text based (a source code header file), and is therefore providing convenient access to it). The second image shows the contents of this resource, which basically contains a path to the target application I chose.\n\n\nSince this 'usro' User Override resource is saved as part of the file itself, that explains why the Launch Services Programming Guide: Choosing the Binding Preference for a File claims the following:\n\nNote: Explicit binding preferences for individual items are not user-specific but systemwide\u2014that is, they continue to apply to the given item on that same computer, even if a different user logs in.\n\nNow, to go one step further. If you now click the Change All button to make this a global override, Launch Services will remove the 'usro' resource entry and instead create a global binding which is stored in the com.apple.LaunchServices.plist (per-user preferences) file. Removing the 'usro' entry is done by using the Resource Manager functions, which will update the file's modification date. Note that while it does remove the 'usro' resource, it may not delete the entire resource fork. In most cases, 286 bytes will remain in the resource fork, which is basically the minimum amount of space taken up by the resource header and resource map.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4382", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}
{"text": "Q: Anti-virus comparison for Mac OS X This is not a \"I use OS X, do I need Anti-Virus?\" question. \nI am looking at comparison and user opinion of existing AV products.\nI know I can avoid most (if not all) threats by being careful on the sites I visit, and the emails I download. But I need an anti-virus, for a variety of reasons - mostly to prevent my Mac as a carrier for viruses. (Many friends' USB drives turn out to be infected).\nI was looking for the \"Best\" of the anti virus software out there.\nI am looking prominently at anti-virus. \"Internet Security\" and the like are not important, and would try to avoid them if it would save money or not make my mac slower.\nBy \"Best\" I mean the best combination of detect-rate (or whatever that is called) and performance. \nI don't intend to run it always in the background. Maybe I would do a onetime scan of my system and hard drives, and then it would be mostly on a need basis, especially on USB drives/portable hard disks of friends.\nSo primary objective: High Detect rate\nI have used Norton Antivirus for Mac and Virus Barrier (got this with one of those software bundles sometime before, not the latest version) and had problems with both. Both sometimes hog my CPU, and somehow \"lock\" my USB drives preventing me from Ejecting it (I had to force eject them or just pull them off from the port) (thought off late Norton seemed a little better)\nOk, thats a long one. But my question is simple: What anti-virus do you recommend for the Mac?\nThanks.\n\nA: ClamXav\nIt is open source and low resource consumption, but is not free.\nThere is also a free command line version available in brew, fink, and macports under clamav (less ugly).  There is some minor configuration, but there are decent guides on the ClamAV site and here, for example.\n\nA: I've personally used Sophos (Standalone version) and found that it causes high-memory utilization and some other file-system issues. (Updates on this one will bring your internet speeds to minimum).\nI find avast! much better. It's free and covers most basic of the environments. The only caveat is the the first scan takes longer (~55 min for me).\nI've also tried Avira, and I rather liked it. I've been using this for some time now and I gotta say it's very fast and easy to use.\nCheck this study by http://www.av-comparatives.org/ for comparison between different programs. http://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mac_review_2013_en.pdf (Published last year)\nAlmost forgot about the Bitdefender. It is one of the best rated AV tools.\n\nA: The best free anti-virus software for OS X is Avira if you consider the software which has the least impact on system performance to be the best.\nThis is based off of a comparison of anti-virus softwares which was published on Sophos' website.\n\nThe original publication conducted by AV-Comparatives is available as a PDF download here.  It is a test of the impact of internet security software on system performance, unaffiliated with any software publisher, making it an unbiased comparison.\n\nAccording the the tests, there is 1 other application which is better than Avira; Eset, but they do not offer a free version of their software.  They do offer a free 30-day trial and a yearly subscription service of $39.99 for one computer.\n\nA: Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac Home Edition\n\nA: 2015 edit: No longer accurate, see other answers.\nClamXav is hard-written to never scan some files such as mp3. This made it entirely useless for me, as I was scanning music downloads. I found (but do not currently use) Panda to be the best, on Mac and Windows.

There's also an alternative method called Subscriber Artificial Module (SAM) which creates a fake but slightly more authentic unlock from iTunes. I have never needed a hacked unlock (Australia has official carrier unlocks) so I don't know much more about it. Unlocking naturally needs a jailbreak to work, which is why the two are sometimes confused.\nIf you want a more technical answer you'll need to specify one or the other, as jailbreaking and unlocking are two entirely different types of hacks.\nI'd also advise against trying anything you don't completely understand because if you don't know what you're doing you're liable to make irreversible changes to your phone, especially when tampering with the baseband.\n\nA: Jailbreak allows installation of non apple approved apps. \nUnlock allows you to use iPhone with another cell phone company.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4410", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

I changed my \"full name\" to include my last name, but I'd like to revert back to just my first name. When I try to change the full name entry under \"accounts\" back to \"Richard\" I can't, with the warning \"Name is not available.\"\nWhat gives? Is there a way to revert to my original short name? This is strictly cosmetic, right? The only place I see my full name is the right side of the menu bar (my short name has never changed from \"richard\"). Thanks!\n\nA: The problem is that your short name is already richard, so your Users\u2019 folder looks like /Users/richard. \nIf you want, you could change your short name (provided you\u2019re in Leopard or Snow Leopard) or, not known to a lot of people is that you can create Aliases. \nFor example if your name is Robert De Niro Of The Great Canyon (wow!), and your account is robertdeniroofthegreatcanyon, you can create an alias to \u201crobert\u201d, to simplify. \nTo do that, in the Advanced Options screen, click the plus (+) button under Aliases and then type your desired account alias. (Do not make any other changes.) click OK and restart (just in case any service may be crazy). \nThis is easy and safe, but it doesn\u2019t actually change your short name at all, nor your home folder among other things.\nIf you want to change your short user name, you have two different approaches. A less \u201cintrusive\u201d method (#1) and a full change (#2):\nOption #1: Change your short name, don\u2019t change your home folder\u2019s name.\nYou basically change your account\u2019s name, but you leave your filesystem alone. Everything will work with your new name, but the files will be under the \u201cold name\u201d\u2019s folder. \nThis works fairly well, except that sometimes, programs insist on storing settings based upon your short username, which could lead to some issues with those programs. \nHere\u2019s how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Automatic Login and FileVault if you have them (for the account you want to rename). You can later reactivate these.\n\n*Logoff completely from the account and login with another account (create one if you have to, you can remove it later).\n\n*ctrl + click on your account name, select advanced options.\n\n*In the \u201cAccount Name\u201d field, delete your username and type the new one. Make sure the \u201chome directory\u201d stays the same as it was before, don\u2019t change it.\n\n*Click ok. Restart. Login using your new short name.\n\n\nOption #2 Change both short name and home folder\nBear in mind that this, like the previous solution, has problems with some settings in certain programs/services that may use your /Users/old_name). You\u2019ll have to check the settings for each and fix it (possibly reconfigure it). After you save the new settings for the programs, things should work ok.\nWarning: Time machine will go coo coo if you change your home folder and will have to backup every file again, because it tracks files using their paths. \n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Automatic Login and FileVault if you have them (for the account you want to rename). You can later reactivate these.\n\n*Logoff completely from the account and login with another account (create one if you have to, you can remove it later).\n\n*ctrl + click on your account name, select advanced options.\n\n*Like with option #1, change the name of your Account Name.\n\n*Change the Home Directory from /Users/old to /Users/new, where new is the short username you typed in step # 4. \n\n*Click OK and close all this, open a Terminal (/Application/Utilities/Terminal.app)\n\n*Type the following command, all on one line, and then press Return; when prompted, provide the password of the admin account you\u2019re currently using, and then press Return again:\nsudo mv /Users/old /Users/new\n(these are the names from step 4 and 5).\n\n\n*restart!\n\n\nWhy all this trouble and where is the answer to your question?\nSo after all this, if you want to have robert in your \u201clogin menu\u201d I believe you should simply tell it to show the short name and leave the rest of the settings alone:\n\nIn any case, if you REALLY want to have both \u201crichard\u201d, you\u2019ll probably have to rename your shortname first.\n\nA: I may be missing something, but I believe I have the direct answer that you are looking for.  I, too changed my \"Full name\" only to find that I could not change it back.\nHere's how to fix it in one simple step: \nSystem Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Options -> Network Account Server: Join -> Open Directory Utility ->\nSelect 'Directory Editor' and at the top left, select 'Users' next to Viewing, click the lock allow write access.\nScroll down to your user name (richard) in the left pane, then select the row in the right pane named 'RealName'.

{"text": "Q: Why does my MacBook Pro die without warning? I have a MacBook Pro (about 18mts old) which has recently started to inexplicably die without warning. I'm running it on battery and, yes, it's getting close to the bottom end (between 10 and 25%). In the past I would get to about 10 minutes of life left and the \"Reserve Battery\" warning dialog would pop up and let me know that I'd better get on the adapter. \nNot any more.\nNow it gets to about 25% and then plik! it's black screen and dead. Instantly. No warning, nothing. \nSome details about the Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware: 2.5Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo 4Gb, 667Mhz DDR2 SDRAM\n\n*Software: 10.5.8\n\n*Model: 4.1\n\n*Boot ROM: MBP4.1.00C1.B03\n\n\nFollowing advice from @Alex, I've checked the system logs (Console) and disk verification tool (Disk Utility) but they both come up clean. Apart from the instant death at low battery, there are no other dubious intermittent faults.\nEdit to cover suggestions so far\nMany thanks to all who have taken the time to address this issue. I've summarised the answers so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look at the battery cycle count (About this Mac | More Info | Hardware - Power - Battery Information) - @glenstorey\n\n*Recalibrate the battery - @Lawrence Vel\u00e1zquez\n\n*Check hardware (RAM seating, hard disk etc) - @Alex\n\n\nFinal result\nThe whole thing about battery cycles being guaranteed by Apple appears to be a myth (at least the bods at my Apple Store were unaware of it). So I changed the battery and all was fixed. Back to normal.\n\nA: Check to see how many cycles your battery has done (System Profiler - Power - Cycle Count); from what I understand your battery will still be under warranty if it has less than 300 - more than 300 and it's on its way out. We have a whole bunch of MacBooks (Pros) here, and once in a while one of them does this exact thing when the battery gets old and tired, just like yours. \nI've had batteries that have lasted 40 months, and some that have only lasted 18, the newer MacBooks with the non-removable batteries last a lot longer.\n\nA: In addition to what has already been said, it\u2019s possible that your battery may be miscalibrated. If true, this would explain why your computer runs out of charge, even though it thinks otherwise.\nI would strongly suggest trying to recalibrate your battery before doing anything else. Instructions can be found in this Apple support article. In a nutshell:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the computer in until it thinks the battery is fully charged.\n\n*Let the battery rest in the fully-charged state for at least 2 hours.\n\n*Unplug and run the computer on battery until the battery is exhausted and the computer goes to sleep.\n\n*Let the computer sleep for at least 5 hours.

{"text": "Q: troubleshooting connections issue between two macs I often want to move files between my MacBook and iMac, but its such an issue that I usually resort to failure. They will see each-other on the network (shown in Finder) but after selecting the machine and waiting a while there will be a message like \"connection filed\" or similar. The other MacBook in the house doesn't even show on this list at all. So I am wondering is there a secret to getting networking happening, or at least something I can use to troubleshoot these issues?\n\nA: First, make sure File Sharing is on for both computers. Then connect an Ethernet cable directly between the two machines. Each machine should appear in the other's sidebar of the Finder. Connect to it by double-clicking (login using your credentials if needed), and then drag your files or folders across at 1Gbps!\nLater,\nMike\n\nA: How strong is your connection?  I assume you're using wifi on the MacBook?  I used to have a lot of issues with this kind of thing until I replaced my wireless router.\n\nA: Either give them both static IP's on the interfaces that are linked with each other, or wait for them both to grab 169.254.x.x IP's.  Also make sure firewalls are down or in a \"half\" state (in Snow Leopard, at least, there's a \"firewall on\" mode as well as a \"block ALL connections\" mode - firewall on works well for me, and still offers protection without hindrance.)\nFailing that try pinging one from the other, and vice versa.  Might have a hardware problem.  I would also disable any other interfaces except for the ethernet ones that you're using to connect them to each other.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4459", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: Is the 3G data rate slower when reception is poorer? At work, my iPhone gets only limited 3G signal. The \"3G\" indicator is there, but the signal strength is only 1 or 2 out of 5 bars. Is the download throughput less under these circumstances, compared with the full 5 bars?\n\nA: Short Version: Yes but it largely depends.\nWhy?: 3G networks travel through air and are subject to interference (as any microwave, radio wave, etcetera). Just like a Wi-Fi network, the principle is the same (only 3G requires a stronger signal from the iPhone, hence why 3G drains more battery, the distances in 3G are measured in miles/Km), as opposed to the limited range of a 11n network). When you are far, the distance for the wave to travel is more and therefore is subject to signal degradation, interference, etc. \nAll these nuisances in the signal travel, cause more packages that need to be resent, which increases the response time and the amount of information that must be transferred.\nSay you request an image, the server gets the request and starts sending data. The signal is low, so the reception is bad, your iPhone keeps saying: what? say again\u2026 I didn\u2019t hear the last part\u2026\nTo put a real life example: If you\u2019re talking 5 feet away from a person, you can understand hear him ok, provided the ambient noise is low. Now add some noise\u2026 you need to talk louder and sometimes you need to request for the other person to repeat because you didn\u2019t hear. \nNow put that person 50feet away\u2026\nYou\u2019re starting to get an idea. \nNow we have to add another real factor:\n3G towers could be a few miles away from you, and there could be a few, so the phone must try to find the strongest one, this process is also time consuming and it causes so many packages to be dropped. When something is dropped, it must be resent\u2026 \nAll in all, it really depends. You might have a low signal, but a decent throughput, but think that the weakness in the signal is making it harder for your phone to communicate.\nThink that wireless connections, need to be as stable as possible to work, and in order to do that, they reduce the speed on purpose. I.e.: send less, but stronger. \nNow I don\u2019t have graphs or numbers (nor the real knowledge to be honest) to explain you how the whole 3G works and what is really involved, but having worked with a driver for a wifi modem, I know about the compromise of the stack to \u201cslow down\u201d when the strength of the signal is bad. You have a limited bandwidth and a limited strength, you have to balance. Wireless prefers strength over speed (which I understand) ;)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4521", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

In fact much code starts with the #!/usr/bin/env python line but is 2.x specific. I would say that having the python executable on your path being linked to python3.1 would be a problem Apple scripts that use python always look for /usr/bin/python so will always find the Apple version and not a properly installed other version.\neasy_install is from an external package setuptools and you can tell setup.py where to put it.\nSimplest is install from the python.org installer This will give a python3 executable in /usr/local/bin (and possibly python as well). In this case I would create a python symbolic link in ~/bin (pointing to the apple python or python3 and you can switch where it points as you require without sudo which a link in /usr/local/bin would require.\nIn this case I think easy_install for python3 will by default end up in /usr/local/bin and the apple one is in /usr/bin\nI use macports versions and they install in /opt/local and have a script port select that will switch /opt/local/bin/python between the 3.1 or 2.6 versions (or any others you have installed) - unfortunately not does not do this for  easy_install which is in  /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin (or 3.1 etc)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4539", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}

Whenever I want to listen to songs from a particular band in iTunes, I'll just type the name in the search box, select shuffle, and start playing. For most bands this works very well, but I've run into a few situations where I'm unable to narrow it down to a single band due to the fact that the name of the band I'm looking for is a subset of the name of a different band. A classic example is \"The Who\" - every time I type \"the who\" in my search bar I get \"The Guess Who\" as well.\nI've tried some of the basic tricks like using quotes or minus symbols but nothing seems to work. Is there a way to do this, or do I have to create special playlists for these problem bands?\n\nA: iTunes doesn\u2019t seem to exhibit any sort of smart searching built into the search box.

They both contain \u201cMeta\u201d in their names.\nSo when I search for artist \u201cmeta\u201d I get both, which is annoying, because I really don\u2019t like Metalium that much\u2026\nSo I have two solutions for you:\na. Use Launchbar (or quicksilver), to quickly find the artist (this is a nice way to do it and what I really use most of the time when I want to find a song or an artist, it works faster than anything else). I use Launchbar. Pressing enter there creates a temporary playlist (called Launchbar) that contains all the tracks in question, but you could have dig a little bit more if you wanted an album or song. Very easy.\n\nb.

{"text": "Q: Application DRM I wanted to know if there is a standard way of making licenses on Mac OS 10.6. For exemple, if I am creating an application and I want to create a licensing system, do I leave a file somewhere in the system that my application can read/write?\n\nA: Mac OS X Applications, tend to be limited due to the UNIX \u201copen\u201d nature of the operating system. Contrary to Windows for example, where one could bury an entry into the Registry under any name, provided you\u2019re given Admin privileges (which is very natural in Windows). \nUnder OS X, applications are forced to use dedicated locations for storing settings and preferences. ~/Library and /Library. \nWith that being said, this doesn\u2019t stop some applications to use other mechanisms in conjunction with that. \nI cannot name them all primary because I don\u2019t know all of the existing ways, but I can tell you some common forms:\nSerial Number / License Key:  These are the typical. The program stores an \u201cencrypted\u201d copy of these values in its preferences (sometimes even unencrypted), usually located in:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Preferences or /Library\n\n*The Application Bundle itself \n\n*Some value in the user\u2019s Home folder (possibly hidden by a .)\n\n\nThe problem with these are obvious, the serials get published/shared/copied and you have no way to stop it. Some applications have a \u201cblacklist\u201d of serials that although perfectly formatted, are internally hardcoded to be bad. \nOnline Activation: Less common (and usually more annoying), these require the app to connect to an online host to \u201cactivate\u201d or \u201cvalidate\u201d the license. This prevents a lot of fraud and usually ends with the application cracked by some genius, where the code that does the validation is simply modified to always return \u201cok\u201d making the application believe that the internet stuff went ok.  Read: Adobe Products.\nIn any case, the program has to store the value somewhere, and the usual locations apply. \nTied with Hardware ID This is common too, they extract your drive\u2019s serial number and some other parameters (Network card MAC Address for example) and they create a serial number that checks for those. So even if you \u201ccopy\u201d the license, the new machine won\u2019t have the same values and it will fail. This is annoying because if your hard drive crashes and you boot from a backup, you\u2019ll have to re-register. \nRESOURCES\nI assume you want to continue reading about this, so instead of believing me, follow these links: \n\n\n*\n\n*How should my Cocoa application store the user\u2019s license key?\n\n*What is the best way to protect a Cocoa shareware application from software piracy?\n\n*MAKeyedArchived  \n\n*Using OpenSSL for keys (good read!)\n\n*AquaticPrime: the famous secure registration framework (free, accepts donations)\n\n*Golden % Braeburn: The not free method used by the famous Delicious Library (among others). \n\n\nA: There is no set \"standard way\", you would have to either build your own from scratch or use one of the online store frameworks.\nIt sounds like what you want would be best suited by the Mac App Store. You'll need to join the Mac Developer Program to get access to it. It's $99 a year.\n\nA: DRM is handled by apple automatically if you use the appledev store submittal.\nThe DRM apple uses is extremely kept information, obviously the record labels and video studios demand this, as apple would love to not deal with it, per Steves frequent emails and other public letters.\nI need more info regarding what you want to DRM, type of content, iOS app, or perhaps you need a simple license /registration procedure, for an OSX.app.\nPlease be verbose\nTefrota Ho\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4559", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: What is the best way to use two 27\" monitors on your desk? In my work environment I have three smaller monitors and love the productivity benefit. At home I have two 27\" displays (the iMac and an external cinema display), but am having trouble laying them out on my desk so I can effectively use them without neck strain. What's the best layout for ensuring most of your work involves you staring straight ahead at your work, while still letting your work spread out over all those lovely millions of pixels?\nEDIT: responses so far have focused on having the monitors at the right level, i.e. at and below eye level. But the problem I'm having is that just one monitor nearly fills my field of vision, so I end up turning my neck or chair dramatically to work on the other.\n\nA: You don't say what you'll be using them for.  I'm (among other things) a programmer, and for me being able to see a tall vertical area in my text editor is of primary importance.  Thus, given 2 widescreen monitors, I'd set them up vertically, next to each other.\nI'm not unique here: when I visited Google, most of the programmers I saw had this layout too.\nI would think this could help with your neck problem, since it makes the display area closer to a square, and not a really wide rectangle.  Alternatively, you could keep them horizontal, and stack one right above the other.  Depends on the shape of the things you're going to be looking at most, I guess!\n\nA: Honestly, I've been using 2 24inch monitors for years (one  24ich connected to my 24inch iMac).  I personally think using two monitors is  not necessary anymore, if you effectively use spaces/virtual desktops.  \nI now only use my 24inch iMac as my only display, and basically just got used to the new setup, while mastering the keyboard shortcuts.  I don't need to move my head, the OS does it for me.\nI say ditch the other monitor and get use to using cntrl+arrow keys, just my opinion.\n\nA: Make sure both are at the same height, if you still have neck strain, then you are not sitting at the right level:\n\n(image courtesy of this link).\nIf you put them higher or lower, you\u2019ll have to adjust with your neck, thus causing strain.\nAn excellent blog post about that was written by our own creator\u2026\nLCD Monitor Arms. Good old school post.\n\nA: Ergonomics in a nutshell: The heuristic is to have your eye line be about 1-2\" below the top of your monitor.  That should allow your arms to be roughly parallel to your desk and your back perpendicular to the base of your chair.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4582", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "12"}}

{"text": "Q: Why is the wireless connection between my MacBook and AirPort Express so unstable?  The wireless transmit rate of my MacBook Core 2 Duo is extremely unstable. That is, when I connect to my AirPort Express the transfer rate is good for about one minute and after that it suddenly drops (option click on the AirPort icon shows a transmit rate of 1...).\nThe strange thing is that when I then click on the AirPort icon next to the clock and new networks are being searched, the rate gets normal again for about 10 seconds. Then again all running downloads and page load stop until I click again.\nI use the same network with a MacBook Pro without any problems. I've googled this issue, tried to switch wireless channels, switched back to 802.11g mode (it runs on n and g compatible mode normally) but nothing helped so far.\nAny ideas what could cause these transfer rate drops?\nUpdate\nNot sure if that's of any use but in the AirPort Utility it says Signal -24, Noise -95 and Rate 1 (it raises when I click the AirPort icon).\nUpdate II\nOne solution seems to be to switch to 802.11n only 5 GHz (2.4 GHz does not help). The downside: iPhone and many older notebooks don't support it...\n\nA: Something to try is to turn off IPv6 support in your networking preference control panel for wireless, and even for ethernet if you are hardwired.\nMine would drop connections randomly and I'd have to mess around and eventually would pull its power and let it restart to restore sanity. Then, I read somewhere it was a problem with IPv6 support, and turn it off on our Macs. Now it's very stable. \nI stopped using it for my wireless router, and now use it for AirTunes. Very seldom will it lag, and when it does it'll sync up again by itself. I really can't remember the last time it \"weirded out\" on me, even though some days I'll be playing music through it for most of the day.\n\nA: Just in case you're still experiencing the issue. I've been having that happen with my early 2008 MBP for two years now. I seem to have found two half-solutions, see below. Please see if they work for you.\nTo recap:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rate is usually good (54)\n\n*drops after minutes, sometimes hours\n\n*rate is good in most all other networks I happen to be in\n\n\nSo, the first thing I noticed is that when I alt-click the airport icon the rate rises from 1 to a rate somewhat higher, maybe 2 or 4 or 8. It then usually drops again. When I alt-click several times in quick succession, I can get the rate to rise up to 48. But again, only to see it drop again.\nMy first half-solution is this: I found out that whenever I experience the rate dropping I can change the channel in my router from, say 1 to 6 or 11, which will usually resolve the issue. After I reconnect to the network things will be fine for a while (minutes, hours, sometimes a day or two).\nMy second half-solution is turning off all other wireless clients in the network. Whenever I'm alone at home and my laptop is the only computer running, everything's fine. I seem to be having the dropping-rate-problem only when other clients are in the same network, especially when one of them is using the network intensely. I'm almost certain about that now. Please try and see if removing all other clients \"solves\" your issue.\nWhenever it is not avoidable to have other clients in the network, I try the first half-solution (sometimes 2 or 3 times) and it usually does the trick.\nIncredibly annoying though!\n\nA: Your wireless card in the computer need replacing. I have 2 Mac Books. an old 2008 Core Duo that does exactly what you describe. And a new Mac Air. The Mac Air works all over the house and has a transmission rate upwards of 300 depending on were it is located. Bottom line wireless cards get weak and die a slow death. The are not hard to replace if you are at all good with a screwdriver.The can be found all over the net and on ebay as well as Ifixit. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4590", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

Unfortunately, I want to take the raw video stream, and hook it into something like a Justin.TV or LiveStream ProCaster for live streaming purposes, but I can't figure out how.\nThe PVR is not listed as a \"video device\" like a camera, so I cannot choose it as a video source. Since this is a MacMini, there are no registered video devices listed in any app on the Mini (say for example, iMovie's \"Import From Camera\" section).\nHow can I take the video feed going into my Mac Mini via USB, and re-use it immediately for any video-like purpose?\n\nA: Argh, I wish I had seen this in time for the bounty.\nI do broadcasts using Camtwist. Camtwist will become a video source and it does things like just broadcast the desktop. So if you have EyeTV maximized and Camtwist broadcasting the desktop and your flash broadcasted using camtwist as a source, you should be set!

My home network is very secure, but my school's wireless network is open, which makes it vulnerable to wireless sniffing (e.g. with Firesheep).

When you join an untrusted network, Sheepsafe switches to a network location that has a SOCKS proxy configured and starts a SOCKS proxy by SSH'ing into a remote server, thus protecting your browsing traffic from FireSheep and other snoopers on the local network. When you switch back to a safe network, Sheepsafe switches back to the default, trusted location and shuts down the SOCKS proxy.\n\n\nA: There are a number of location switch apps that work along with the Location feature such as NetworkLocation and LocationX.

The above keystrokes scroll the terminal window, but if the terminal window has not been paged, then scrolling won't accomplish anything.\nThe second half of the answer is one that I can't answer without more detail.\nExample:  \n\n\n*\n\n*In less, the spacebar or ctrl ^+f will page down one screen full.  \n\n*In vim, ctrl ^+f will page down one screen full.  \n\n*In screen, you will probably never have to Page Down, but if you scrolled back in copy mode, ctrl ^+f works there too.\nIf I haven't answered your question, you will need to elaborate on it, heavily.\n\nA: In addition to VxJasonxV\u2019s answer (which is correct), if you want to modify your terminal behavior so using up or down does a pageup/pagedown in vim (and others), you can go to:\nTerminal -> Preferences -> Click on the Settings Toolbar, then the Keyboard Tab.\nAdd a new keys like this: (showing one example below)\n\n\n*\n\n*Page Up: \\033[5~\n\n*Page Down: \\033[6~\n\n*Home: \\033[4~\n\n*End: \\033[1~\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example with the \u201cCursor up\u201d: \n\nNow you can press Up/Down and it will do the pageup/down. I suggest you add a modifier (like Control). Sadly, you can\u2019t use the \u201cFn\u201d key as a modifier. \nNote: By default, Control + Cursor Left is delete until the end of the line and control+cursor right is insert (in vim at least), so you can use another modifier if you don\u2019t want to change those.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4629", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "12"}}

{"text": "Q: What issues might (legacy) FileVault cause? Edit: The below was written before Lion came out, so this post is referring to what is now called \"Legacy FileVault\", which encrypts only your home directory.\nI've enabled FileVault on my computer and haven't had any problems yet, but I've read online that FileVault has issues. What are these issues? Are they out of date and fixed in Snow Leopard or are there still problems that I might have in the future?\nI like the idea of my disk being encrypted, and it hasn't seemed slow to me, but I'd like to be aware of any possible pitfalls that currently exist with FileVault.\n\nA: There are a number of possible pitfalls to having an encrypted home folder; most of them are more-or-less intrinsic to the idea, so they're not likely to go away... ever.\nUPDATE: Lion's FileVault 2 uses full-volume encryption rather than just home-directory, so it actually does make some of these issues go away and changes several others.  I've added notes in [] below.  Note that upgrading to Lion does not automatically convert to FV2; you must first turn off \"Legacy FileVault\" encryption for accounts using the old system, then turn on VF2 to reencrypt.\n\n\n*\n\n*Speed: obviously, the computer has to decrypt the data to read it from disk, and encrypt it before reading from disk, which'll slow down disk access.  This usually isn't a big deal unless you're doing something like video editing.  There's also a delay at logout as it recovers space in the image (and maybe also backs it up; see below). [VF2 removes the logout delay, and can use hardware AES instructions (on CPUs that support them) to minimize the general slowdown.]\n\n*Too much security: the good thing about FileVault is that nobody can get at your data without your login password (of the computer's master password).  The bad thing is that if you forget your password (and don't remember/haven't set a master password), you can't get at your data either.  The recommended procedure is to set a master password (before enabling FileVault), write it down, and store the written copy someplace secure (e.g. sealed envelope in a safe deposit box). [VF2 creates a recovery key, which functions very similarly to the old master key. There's also an option to have Apple store the recovery key for you, although I'd recommend using that in addition to (not instead of) storing the key yourself.]\n\n*File non-sharing: FileVault security prevents you from sharing files out of your home folder.  Your Public folder, normally accessible by other users on the computer (and if you have file sharing turned on, other computers on the network) is locked in the FileVault and available only to you. [FV2 removes this limitation.]\n\n*Risk of data corruption: normally, if your computer crashes there's a possibility that whatever files you had open could get corrupted; with FileVault, your entire home folder is contained in a disk image, and if that gets corrupted you could lose everything.  IIRC both OS X v10.3.0 and 10.4.0 shipped with bugs that could corrupt the types of images used by FileVault (fixed in 10.3.1 and 10.4.1, but still...).  So backup is very important if you have data you don't want to lose. [FV2 does not have the image corruption issue, but is still vulnerable to normal volume corruption; it will also limit your options for data recovery somewhat, as not all volume repair/recovery tools support encrypted volumes (yet).]  Speaking of which:\n\n*Backup time: backing up the FileVault image file is generally only possible when you're logged out.  External volumes (like backup drives) get dismounted when nobody's logged in, creating a bit of a catch-22 for many backup systems.  Time Machine gets around this by doing a backup as you log out (after the image becomes accessible, but before the backup drive gets dismounted), so make sure you log out with the backup drive attached from time to time.  Other backup systems... who knows.  In any case, test to make sure you're actually getting a useable backup. [FV2 removes this limitation. Note that Time Machine under Lion supports encrypting the backup volume, in which case it can only back up when the backup volume is mounted and decrypted.]\n\n*Backup capacity: backup systems generally save space by only backing up files that've changed since the last backup.  With your files hidden in a disk image, this isn't really possible.  The image is stored as a series of \"band\" files (in \"sparse bundle format\"), so the backup system only needs to store the bands that changed, but since these don't neatly correspond to specific files in your home folder, it's still going to use more space than if it could back up the files directly. [FV2 removes this limitation.]\n\n*Backup recovery: since the files you're likely to want to recover from a backup are hidden inside the encrypted image, they're a lot less convenient to recover from backup.  When using Time Machine, its slick view-through-time interface doesn't work with FileVault-protected files, you have to find the backup of the image, mount it, and recover the file(s) you want by hand.  Similarly, if you want to recover a file from an online backup, you're likely to have to recover the entire image so you can mount it and pull out the file(s) you want. [FV2 removes this limitation.]\nOne more note: to keep people from bypassing FileVault, make sure you have secure (encrypted) virtual memory enabled (in System Preferences -> Security pane -> General tab), and either log out consistently (yeah, right) or require a password immediately after sleep or screen saver (same place) and set the screen saver to run automatically when the computer's been idle for a while.  There is an option to automatically log out after a period of inactivity, but this doesn't always work (a program with unsaved documents will generally prevent logout).  [FV2 encrypts the virtual memory swap along with everything else, although the advice about locking or logging off still applies.  Also, 10.7.0-10.7.1 were vulnerable to FireWire DMA attacks in some states, but this appears to have been fixed in 10.7.2.]\n\nA: Filevault has/had some issues in the past, but it also had some pros:\nPROS: \n\n\n*\n\n*Easy to backup (one big image file)\n\n*Protection from unwanted users trying to read your home folder.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Forget your password and you can start forgetting about your data. No way you\u2019re going to get it back.\n\n*If the image for your Filevault gets corrupted somehow, your data will be trapped forever in there\u2026\n\n*No recovery software will be able to read through the encrypted data, so forget about this.\n\n*Startup/Shutdown times are a little bit longer due the cleaning and initializing of the image, the same with some big copies to/from your home. \n\n*Free space for the image will only be reclaimed at shutdown (at least it was like that in Leopard) so you might want to restart every now and then if you move large amounts of data inside your home folder.\n\n*Disabling FileVault: Some people have reported problem when disabling filevault (I\u2019ve never done that to be honest). Some even quote that they had to reinstall OS X. \n\n*Time Machine: Filevault won\u2019t backup your home folder unless you logoff, it will happily skip it until you do that. \n\n*Time Machine II: You cannot restore individual files in your home via T.M. (because they are encrypted and out of reach of TimeMachine) ;)\n\n\nThere are some more stuff you might want to consider that I can\u2019t remember right now. Here\u2019s a link that talks about performance (taken from SuperUser).\nAnd if you want to backup your Home folder while using FileVault and while being logged, it is possible, but the backup will be stored unencrypted. Check this question.\n\nA: One big one I can think of is that if you enable FileVault you won't be able to use the new Find my Mac feature in case your laptop is stolen.\nYou can only use one or the other.\nAlso, as you might've already found out if you enabled it some things won't be available via GUI anymore so you will have to use the terminal to work with the encrypted disk.\nFinally, until Apple releases an update for Bootcamp if you plan on running that you may run into some major problems.\n\nA: One issue seems to be upgrading to Lion. The old FileVault functionality is gone, and you have to first convert your FileVault directories (to normal unencrypted ones). That cannot happen in-place, so you may need quite a bit of temporary disk space.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4640", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}
{"text": "Q: Do you have a better way to browse Windows 7 machines in Finder (SL 10.6.5)? Browsing the \"network neighborhood\" in OS X Finder does show XP machines, but not Windows 7 machines. (Vista machines have a similar problem). I can connect manually to Windows 7 machines (\"connect to server\" and then specifying \"smb://ip_or_name\"), but want to be able to browse Win 7 machines automatically.\nBrowsing works if security is lowered on the Windows 7 machines, and the OS X machine is forced to be the master browser. Question: Who has a better solution? I would like to find another solution without having to change OS X and all Windows 7 machines. Maybe you know some extra OS X software that \"makes samba just work right\"?\n\nA: Windows 7 has extra network security options, and one of them sets its discoverability. By default in Windows 7, when you connect to a new network you are prompted for what type of network it should be: Public, Work, or Home. These profiles set up the firewall and security options when on that network; I can't off the top of my head list all the things they specifically set up, but when you select Public, sharing and discoverability are locked tight, whereas in Home they are more relaxed.\nIt's very likely that you have set your network type to Public on your Windows 7 computer. If you open the Network and Sharing Center, under the name of your active network it should say either \"Home network\", \"Work network\" or \"Public network\". If it is indeed set to Public (or Work), click it and then click Home network. You shouldn't have any problems after that.\nAlternatively, you can open the start menu and type Network and hit enter. This opens the Network window, which lets you browse other computers on your network. As soon as the window opens, a yellow bar should appear at the top informing you that network discoverability is turned off; click the bar and then click one of the resolution options. This may fix the problem as well.\nI haven't had any problem in OS X connecting to my Windows 7 computers that are set to Home network, as they should be. But a Windows 7 computer set to Public network should be basically undetectable.\n\nA: The Non-Ideal Solution\nAfter reading a lot of hints, lowering the required client security on the Windows and making the OS X machine the master browser works reliably for me. However, this solution is less than ideal, as it requires reconfiguring the Mac and every Win 7 computer.\nSteps\nChanges to Windows 7:\n\n\n*\n\n*change the security policy. Using  secpol.msc, go to local security, security options and find \"Network security: \nMinimum session security for NTLM-SSP based...\" both for client and server.\n(sorry, may be different, I have a German install).\n\n*\n\n*uncheck \"NTLMv2 session security required\"\n\n*leave \"128 encryption required\" checked.\n\n\n\n128 bit encryption works with Snow Leopard. Unchecking it is required for some older versions of OS X.\nChanges to OS X Snow Leopard:\n\n\n*\n\n*edit /private/etc/smb.conf\n\n*locate \"os level = 2\" and change to \"os level = 99\" which makes this samba always win\n\n*locate \"domain master = no\" on next line and change to \"domain master = yes\"\n\n\nStarting the new configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*shut down your OS X and disconnect or shut down all your Windows clients.\n\n*restart OS X. This way, OS X will become the master browser for samba.\n\n*restart or reconnect your Windows clients.\n\n\nThe Very Simple Solution\nBy using OS X Server (properly configured), browsing will \"just work\", without the need to reconfigure anything else.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get OS X server.\n\n*Configure SMB as Standalone Server\n\n*\n\n*enable Workgroup Master Browser\n\n*enable Domain Master Browser\n\n*enable WINS server\n\n\n*under Access, allow NTLMv2 & Kerberos, NTLM, LAN Manager   (according to what your minimum security should be)\n\n\nThis may be more than necessary, but it made the situation unambigous.\nThe problem is circumvented. It is not a principal problem of OS X Server, which uses the same Samba build as OS X client. It works reliable with the server solution. Since there is rather little interest in this topic, I will not further investigate, sorry.\nAbout the server cost: It is quite pricey. If you happen to be registered as an Apple Developer, then you can run an evaluation copy of OS X server.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4647", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

Senuti costs $18, but there's a trial version, which can transfer up to 1000 songs.\nNeither of these require a jailbreak.\n\nA: Phoneview - is a great option, as it allows you to access your entire media directory.

Basically, I want to be able to tether my laptop to my iPhone 4 but I don't want to pay for extra service or lose my unlimited plan.

I've also heard that you can do some things if you have a developer account.\nSo, are there any free, simple ways to do this without jailbreaking my phone?\n\nA: It's probably not an easy way but since there have been some apps snuck into the app store that had hidden tethering abilities: http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/07/apple-approves-pulls-flashlight-app-with-hidden-tethering-mode/ It's clearly possible to do this in an app but not one that will be in the official store.

{"text": "Q: How Many iTunes Accounts I have an iPhone 4 with an iTunes account. My husband got his own iPhone 4 today. Is it better to have one or two iTunes accounts, but not have to rebuy apps. \n\nA: I think that Apple's article on iTunes Home Sharing should cover what you're looking for. My husband and I have separate accounts, and anything we both want, we share.\n\nA: It's easy to break things down with the two \"rules of 5\".\nEach account (Apple ID to be technical) can be authorized on 5 computers at the same time.\nEach device is happy to track purchases from 5 different accounts. \nThere is no limit on the number of devices that get to sync to any computer that is currently \"authorized\" so hundreds of devices can feed from that one iTunes library. All purchases from the 5 accounts that are \"authorized\" get to sync without passwords being entered.\nSo if you both had an account - your shared computer would count as one authorization for you and one for your spouse. Each of you could take your iPhones to 3 other friend's house and sync apps and music there (since you used 2 \"slots\" for your accounts). Most people never come close to the 5 limit.\nYou do need to know each account's password to update the apps on the go - so having twice the accounts means an extra step to update on the road or having to wait for a password or having the apps download at home by your spouse. \nThere's no way to split things up later - so if you don't mind the extra hassle of two accounts (and remembering to sign in and out on the computer to keep straight which account is buying what from the computer) it's often better to have two store accounts.\nI always recommend if you don't share underwear drawers, don't share iTunes accounts. There's nothing wrong with a little individual space - especially when it's easy to share whenever you feel like it.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4685", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

{"text": "Q: How do I enter Dutch names in Address Book? Dutch surnames are kind of weird, in that a lot of them start with small words such as \nde/'t/het (\"the\"), van (\"of\"), van 't, van der (\"of the\"), etc. This makes them a pain to enter in most address books, since you really want to ignore that part of the name when sorting, but not when displaying. This means you get \"Piet Vries\" instead of \"Piet de Vries\".\nWhile Address Book has the \"middle name\" field, which can be abused for this, it really isn't meant for it, causing some applications (iCal, for example) to ignore the field, showing an incomplete name.\niTunes solves this problem for artist and album names, giving you a \"sort album\" or \"sort artist\" field to enter a string to sort on (so \"The Beatles\" are sorted as if they're called \"Beatles\"). I haven't been able to find a similar field in Address book.\nSo, what is the correct way to make Address Book deal with this?\n\nA: My preference is to list their name as something like \"Heirseele, van\" because when searching by last name you'll still find them using \"van\" if you decided to. Putting the preposition in another field is a little hackey (and incorrect from a data-integrity point of view) for me.\nFor the benefit of others: in Dutch, all those prefixes are part of the name. You refer to someone in Dutch as \"Meneer van Heirseele\" not as \"Meneer Heirseele\". Those names haven't joined the prepositions like French names have (e.g., Dupr\u00e9).\nJust my two cents\u2026\n\nA: The better-world answer is that Address Book should allow users to enter Dutch surnames with the tussenvoegsels ..\nFirst name: Rembrandt\nLast name: van Rijn\n\nFirst name: Huig\nLast name: de Groot\n\n... and then allow users to specify what collation method to use.  That way someone using one collation can exchange contact information with someone using a different collation, and the names will show up where both expect them.  \nThe term for the bundle of preferences which includes grouping and ordering of names, thousands and decimal point indicators, sort order for non-ASCII vowels, etc., is \"locale.\"  It's not just the Dutch: Gaelic names treat Mac, Mc and M' as identical.  \nThe Address Book needs work on \"locale.\"\n\nA: If you don't mind misusing a field, you can use the \"Phonetic Last Name\" field to change the sort order.\n\nA: I would enter the surname prefixes (\"de\" etc) into the firstname field. \nBenefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*That way, sorting would work correctly regardless whether you prefer sorting by first or last name, \n\n*the full name is always displayed correctly because it simply combines first + last name,\n\n*you don't have to fill in additional fields.\n\n\nA: They've got prefix and suffix fields, so would it really be that hard to have a mid-fix or whatever the correct english term is field?\nGoogle suggests infix or interfix, BTW.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4697", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

{"text": "Q: Is there a way to access the TOR network on iOS devices? What are my options for using TOR on an iPod Touch, either using something similar to the VPN settings, or through dedicated apps for browsing/email/RSS ?\n\nA: I suspect you would be able to use TorVPN's PPTP Server, just make sure you switch the \"Send All Traffic\" switch on the VPN configuration settings to \"on\". Otherwise it will be astoundingly ineffective :).\nNote that I have not used this service, but knowing what iOS supports (L2TP/IPSec, PPTP, Cisco L2TP), I have a hunch that it will work.\n\nA: TOR runs on the TorVPN server, actually - so you don't have to run the client software on your end at all.\nTo enable it, just log in to your control panel at http://torvpn.com and in your VPN settings click the checkbox that says 'Transparent TOR routing' or something. It's a server side configuration you can do through the TorVPN website. Hope that clears it up.\nBy the way, PPTP is very unstable in the sense that it works for some people, and doesn't work for others. This is probably because of the GRE protocol and natting issues. I have a feeling PPTP is the only TorVPN supported way that works with iPods, but generally I recommend OpenVPN above all.\nps: i can hardly imagine what you want to do in an iPod that you want TOR for... could you help my curiosity?\n\nA: Yes. Open VPN can be used on all iOs devices. Open VPN Connect is a free app that you can load open VPN config files into. I use it to connect my iOs devices to the Private Internet Access VPN. I think you should be able to use it to connect to tor as well.

{"text": "Q: Which Macbook Pro Hi-Res screen is better for editing photos? The Apple shop lists glossy and antiglare options for their Hi-Res screens and I'm not sure what the difference is, and in particular which one is better for editing photos.\n\nA: This is 80% what calavera already said, and I'm only posting it for a few additional details that wouldn't fit into a comment. Translation: Accept calavera's answer instead, if you're thinking about accepting mine.\nGlossy is generally considered better for accurate color gamut (I believe that's the proper term). Closer to \"real life\", full representation, etc. If you're professionally serious, I would still recommend picking up a color calibration kit, but you'll likely have less tweaking to do for accurate representation.\nAnti-glare is exactly what it says, and exactly as calavera put it, it doesn't reflect the sun, room lights, generally light sources nearly as strongly, so you can use it nearly anywhere without having to re-orient/re-angle yourself. But, as a side effect of this, colors are dulled, a bit washed out.\nPhoto editing, video editing, anything that is geared for visual presentation pretty much demands a glossy screen, as opposed to something with just a visual interface (surfing, audio editing). Of course, with Apple making the anti-glare the \"special order\", it's there for people who need it, but otherwise people get the better choice in the majority of situations, by default.\n\nA: In my experience I would have to say the glossy.  Even though the resolutions are the same, I really think that the glossy has much better color reproductions and looks more natural.  The anti-glare tends to dull the colors, making it more difficult to judge when making adjustments.  In fact, both my wife and I went with the glossy earlier this year for exactly this reason (photo editing).  She has a lot more experience with photoshop than I, and she was blown away by the difference in color between the two.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4712", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

If not, are there any free or relatively cheap tools out there to accomplish this?\n\nA: You can also start Automator workflows with iCal if you just want something simple. Otherwise I would do it through launchd. \n\nA: iCal can be used to run AppleScripts, launch applications, and perform tasks to a schedule.\nThere are limitations to using iCal, but it is included with Mac OS X and relatively easy to set up. The limitations and a visual walk through on how to set up a scheduled AppleScript are included in the link above.\n\n\nA: There are two Unix command-line tools that do what you want.  at will allow you to schedule a task to execute once at a specific time in the future.  Of course, part of the task could be to schedule another task.\ncron allows you to schedule tasks to regularly execute at the same time, based on time of day, day of the week, etc.  \nOne thing to note is that both of these will not run tasks if your machine is not running at the time they are scheduled.  There are alternatives, such as anacron, that will run scheduled tasks the next time the machine boots.\n\nA: Scheduler for MacIntosh is a gui-based task scheduler for macOS can be downloaded at https://macscheduler.net/. Been using it to run a backup app I wrote.  Runs in background, doesn't need to be opened at startup.

{"text": "Q: Settings for Firewall and AirPort Extreme Router to Open a Port I am trying to make ports on my OS X 10.6.5 MBP accessible to the open internet.\nThe only thing I could find in the system firewall was allowing (or disallowing) a particular.app file, but nothing about specific ports. From Googling I read that the firewall is supposed to let an allowed.app use any ports it wants and specification is not needed. I added the .app I wanted to add the port for.\nThe router is an AirPort Extreme v7.5.1. \nI've created a DHCP Reservation based on wireless MAC address for the laptop, 10.0.0.5.\nUnder Advanced: Port Mapping, I added a new entry with the same values for each combination of fields:\nPublic/Private UDP/TCP Port: 9000\nPrivate IP Address: 10.0.0.5\nI want port 9000 on my public IP address to forward to port 9000 on internal IP 10.0.0.5.\nWhen I test my application after this, it doesn't work.\nTo further test, I've turned off the system firewall on the laptop, and I've also placed the laptop in the 'DMZ' by checking Enable default host at: 10.0.0.5\nEven with this configuration set (disabled firewall in the dmz), a full port scan from GRC Shields Up!! reports no ports open whatsoever. Is that normal for OS X? I come from Windows-land, so that would be a surprise.\nIs something wrong here?\n\nA: Something's wrong.  If you've only got the Apple device between yourself and the internet - you've verified your external IP, you've lowered your machine's firewall, and you've DMZ'd your internal IP (which you've verified is correct...) - then the only way a connection can be halted is through another piece of software running on your machine.\nIf you go through all of those steps, you should be completely open to the internet.\n\nA: Wait.\nIf you are set to be wide open and you are showing as filtered from somewhere outside your network, then look to your ISP. \nEDIT:  After some research ipfw supersedes the Application firewall ( socketfilterfw) so, setting ipfw to allow the ports you want open should help.

Apple has a guide for conditioning laptop batteries, yet I can't find a version for iOS devices (still looking).\nThere is a general tips page on maintaining great battery life, as well as general terms about battery replacement.\nPersonally: This sounds like a bad battery.

A possible workaround to see if it is app involved or a bad battery, is to drain your phone to a similar level, open the fast app switcher bar (double tap the home button), tap-hold on any application in the task bar until they begin to \"jiggle\", then press the white minus inside the red circle on EVERYTHING. This will kill any and all tasks that aren't first-party. (For example, it will not stop the occasional housekeeping/tasks that Mail, Phone, Safari, or other built-in apps are allowed to do.)\nHaving said that, to properly test, ensure that mail's auto-fetch is off (or in push only mode at best), make sure that you have no tabs in Safari with \"live\" or automatically refreshing content.

At least since iOS 2.something (where I started with an iPhone 3G).\n\nA: A note to those who find this QA: a link here from Apple can be helpful.\nThis morning when my battery was draining out, I tried the above tips ( reproduced below), and it worked. \n\nIf you have an Exchange email account\n  you probably have some stale sync\n  threads. Try this:\nGo to Settings/Mail,contacts,calendar.\n  Tap the name of the account. Turn off\n  the 3 switches. Back out to the main\n  settings page.

This is the model with the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M video card.  This MacBook Pro should support the higher resolution of the 30 inch model (2500x1600 res), but...\nHow do I add the older 24\" monitor (1900x1200 res) into the mix?  \nThe laptop stays closed, but technically this is 3 screens.

I have read about several USB to DVI converters on Amazon, most with mixed reviews. \nCan anyone recommend a specific piece of hardware known to work?\n\nLater addition:\nThanks everyone for the helpful answers.  \nThanks Martin, but the Matrox is unsuitable for my setup as I have one 2500x1600 and one 1900x1200 monitor.

I had a major problems with the DisplayLink 1.5 drivers when trying to resume from sleep. The 1.6b3 drivers fixed that.\n\n*You cannot use the Mac built in screen capture on the USB monitor.  No biggie, but it tripped me up until I figure out that was the issue. \nRock on.\n\nA: A new product has been announced today about this. On the Windows side, the Matrox DualHead/TripleHead were common, but not available for Mac. \nThat has recently changed because Matrox Introduces New Mac-Friendly DualHead2Go DP and TripleHead2Go DP Multi-Monitor Adapters.\n\nA: I use a USB to DVI adapter based on the DisplayPort line of products with my MacBook Pro (2007 running Snow Leopard 10.6).  Overall, I am quite happy with it however there are a few things you should note:\n\n\n*\n\n*It does not support hardware acceleration so certain programs, such as iMovie, will refuse to launch when the device is plugged into your computer.  iMovie is the only program that I have come across that is affected but I mainly do web development and work in PhotoShop.\n\n*At this time, the DisplayPort drivers do not support color profiles.  Your only option for color calibrating your monitor will be whatever manual controls your monitor comes with.  It's not a deal breaker for me as I mainly edit text but if you are color correcting photos it could be a problem.\n\n*Small youtube videos play pretty well but you won't want to use the monitor for anything like fullscreen playback.  It will work, but the results will be pretty choppy.\n\n*Make sure you are on a USB2 hub or directly plugged into a USB port on your machine.  It won't run over anything slower.\n\n\nYou can find a link to my preferred vendor here, though any product with Mac Drivers based on the newer chipset (resolution higher than 1080p) will work:\nhttp://eshop.macsales.com/item/Newer%20Technology/VIDU2DVIA/\nDon't buy an adapter that uses DisplayPort if it does not specifically say it will work on a Mac.

The front and back covers of iPhone 4 are made of glass and have an oleophobic coating. To clean these surfaces, simply wipe with a soft, lint-free cloth. The ability of this coating to repel oil will diminish over time with normal usage, and rubbing the screen with an abrasive material will further diminish its effect and may scratch the glass.\n  \u2014 iPhone\n  User Guide, page 54\n\n(emphasis added)\nOr in other words: remember that little piece of cloth that came with your iPhone? That's all you should need.\n\nA: I often slide the phone across my sweater (chest or sleeves) - anything that's soft, reasonably dry and clean, and won't scratch the glass will do.\n\nA: I swipe my iPhone 3GS across soft parts of my clothing, which works OK. But any microfiber cloth should work much better than plain cotton, and should also work reasonably well without being damp.

{"text": "Q: Easy way to get gcc and make in OS X I want to install a few CPAN modules in OS X.\nIt filed since the module I want requires make and gcc to be installed. A quick google on the subject tells me that I need to install \"Apple Developer Tools\".\nDo I really have to install the entire Xcode package (it's a 3 GB download) just to get make and gcc?\n\nA: I would highly recommend installing the developer tools. They are free from Apple. \nIf you really don't want Xcode after the fact, you could just remove the Application itself. You may also be able to not install any documentation, which I think also takes a bit of space. \n\nA: You can use osx-gcc-installer to get GCC and related tools without installing Xcode.\nNote that there might be legal problems with osx-gcc-installer, and for this reason make-gcc-without-xcode has been made as an alternative. It requires the Xcode installer package, and generates an archive with only the necessary stuff -- no Xcode.\n\nA: While I would certainly suggest that you download and install the developer tools from Apple, you can obtain gcc, etc. in any number of other ways.

{"text": "Q: Is there an easy way to update a NetBoot image? I have a NetBoot image which I use for booting into to do things like disk maintenance and testing new applications without having to install them on my workstation. It's really handy, but I created it a while ago and much of the software on it is now out of date, like the OS, QuickTime, and Safari. I want to update the NetBoot image but the only way I think to do that is to use Disk Utility.app to restore it to a USB drive, boot from the drive directly, make any changes necessary and re-image the USB drive, overwriting the original image.\nIs that the best series of steps or is there an easier way to update a NetBoot DMG file?\n\nA: I think you've got the best way, I know you can mount the disk image inside the netboot image, but AFAIK it breaks the netboot; and some updates can't be applied to a non-boot-drive disk image. \nIf you're netbooting a lot, I'd recommend using DeployStudio, a free, open-source powerhouse for network deployment and the like; it makes it a bit easier to update / deploy images than netboot - but it might be a but much for what you're using netboot for. \n\nA: I would suggest just using a separate user account if you want to test out applications without changing the environment you are working in, if your OS and everything else is up to date.\nIf that is not the route you are looking for, then I agree with glenstory that your direction is the Apple way to go, and will take more time, but maybe less time than learning DeployStudio which will let you update a netboot image, which Apple's System Image Utility will not.\nFinally, a third option is to have an install on an external drive that you can update and boot to to test things.  You have the base as the Netboot that you are using, so that is a good base to start from.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4804", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: What do you think about Apple's Ping service? Personally, I have not signed up the Ping service that is included in iTunes 10.  My main reason for avoiding it is the fact that Apple requires you to use your real, full name for registration.\nWhat are your opinions of the service?\n\n\n*\n\n*pros/cons\n\n*privacy or security concerns?\n\n*things you wish they had done/not done\n\n*things you'd like to see added\n\n*things you'd like to see removed\n\n\n*note: this question is serious but also meant as a sort of experiment to see if a discussion question can be useful or relevant on the site. if you hate it or don't want any sort of discussion other than the occasional list question, vote to close but please post a comment explaining your reasoning\n\nA: Primarily, I don't understand the purpose.  I don't know a single person in the world whose musical taste I trust, or that I think is similar to mine.  I've seen last.fm, facebook, twitter, etc., and they've taught me to ignore musical recommendations.\nMalcolm Gladwell wrote a New Yorker article about how social network links have so little value because they're so easy.  I might get 50 musical recommendations on facebook this week, and I'd only have to click twice to listen, and I'm not going to listen to any of them.  But when the guy who lives next door hears me listening to Brahms, and stops in and says \"You might like this other thing too!\", and brings me a CD, I'll put it in my stereo and listen to it 2 or 3 times.\nSecond, the interesting music I'd want to share is largely not on iTunes.  It's the bootleg of some Asian singer whose recording you can't get here yet (and maybe never).  It's the Youtube video of some guy you kind of know playing at a club downtown last week.  It's the out-of-print-for-40-years LP on my shelf of an incredible and rare recording of a popular group, that I got at a garage sale once for $4.  It's the MP3 preview that some up-and-coming composer dropped on his blog to show you what he's doing.\nLike everything Apple seems to do these days, Ping is probably great if you only care about recent mainstream name-brand consumer goods.  (Lady Gaga at the announcement!)  From a couple of longhairs who started out selling devices to let you make phone calls without paying, Apple has really turned into a company that doesn't care for the fringe -- even the legal fringe.\nThird, it's part of iTunes.  Back in 2003, I thought iTunes was awesome.  These days, it's got so much crap in it, I don't even know how to do all the things I used to know how to do.  It's confusing and frustrating and I use it as little as possible -- only for feeding my iPod, for things that can't be loaded directly.  (iPods have gotten a lot more complex and confusing since 2003, too, but there's pretty much no competition in this space.)  So Ping would have to be pretty awesome for me to want to use iTunes more than once every couple weeks, and it's not.\nSo if I wanted to do something that I don't, but can do already in better ways, but now do it in an app I hate instead of on the web ... I guess Ping would be for me.\nYou know what would be a better thing to put in iTunes, since apparently it's no longer just about \"tunes\"?  Recipes!  I need to keep track of them somewhere, and iTunes might be better than a bunch of text files.  Plus, I actually do trust food recommendations from friends, so Ping-for-Recipes would actually be worth something to me.\n\nA: Weird question, but\u2026 a user with a name calavera (which we still don\u2019t know if it comes from Skull in spanish or Sepultura\u2019s brothers) and the Xcode icon on its profile, what can you expect\u2026 ;)\n\ncalavera as in Manny Calavera, the\n  travel agent and grim reaper :)  --calavera\n\nIn any case, here\u2019s what happened with Ping and I.\n\n\n*\n\n*New iTunes. Oh ping, what\u2019s that? \n\n*10 minutes investigating, registering, etc. \n\n*A few days later. Nobody had it. There was nothing (other than 3-4 authors)\n\n*Found a way to disable it. \n\n*New iTunes update. Native disabling. \n\n*Disabled it all. Removed my ping account.\n\n\nHow could it be better?\nI\u2019m not sure, maybe if it was Facebook instead. People already has facebook, nobody wants another social network. Facebook+Twitter is enough for 99%. \nI want to tell my friends (or group of friends): Hey, listen to this, it\u2019s cool, you\u2019ll like it. \nI want to be able to see what they have found\u2026\nFor everything else, there\u2019s Mastercard.\n\nA: One day the RIAA will reach for your music through ITunes.  Spotlight will tell them where it is on your drive, Ping will tell them what.  You think that people who are setting up the equivalent of S.P.E.C.T.R.E won't wait until the political or economic situation  of Apple, the leading music player manufacturer, will allow them to purchase, or negotiate a time time to attack \"filesharers\" in that fashion?  \nThat being said, it's a good idea in principle:  People who share my music taste to a high degree, are almost always people I can get along with.  But share my mp3 list with Apple's backend?  Perhaps not.  Last.fm is ok, or SomaFM for variety.  I don't need to be a data source any more than I am.\n\nA: Ping does not let me like music unless it is in iTunes, which sharply limits its value as a discovery tool.\n\nA: Remove: ping\nAdd: Facebook\nInstead of trying to create a new social network (which people are quite reluctant to change) they should have partnered with Facebook. Or at least tied into Facebook so that you could find friends using Facebook. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4806", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: How to get the fully resolved path of a symbolic link in Terminal? I have a tangled mess of python installations on my laptop.

I've found some tidbits here and there regarding use of pwd -P and the find utility to do this.  The problem is that these don't seem to work on OS X the way that people describe them working on linux (i.e. outputting the full path to the symbolic link).  They just print the symbolic links path for me:\nFantasticMrFox:bin robert$ pwd -P python3\n/usr/local/bin\nFantasticMrFox:bin robert$ find `pwd -P` -name python3\n/usr/local/bin/python3\n\nAny ideas on what's going on here?\n\nA: I think that pwd -P and readlink are going to be your friends for this task.\n\"How can I get the behavior of GNU's readlink -f on a Mac?\" is a handy resource.\npwd -P only works if you're inside the symlink directory:\n14:07:13 jason@mac ~ $ cd bin\n14:08:08 jason@mac bin $ pwd -P\n/Users/jason/Applications\n\nreadlink works by specifying the target (thus it can be used against files):\n14:09:03 jason@mac ~ $ readlink bin\nApplications\n\n14:09:34 jason@mac ~ $ readlink /var\nprivate/var\n\nThe output of readlink appears to be relative to the parent of the specified target.\nEx: The parent of /var is /, so private/var is correct, relative to /. Per my above example of bin -> Applications, both are in my Home Directory, no matter where I run it, the output is the same.\n\nA: GNU coreutils-8.15 added in 2012 a new command-line tool realpath that does what you want: it resolves chains of symbolic links and outputs the result as either an absolute (default) or relative path.\nApple does not yet include realpath in macOS (they sadly seem to shun all GPLv3 tools), but you can easily install it yourself, e.g. using Homebrew: brew install coreutils.\n\nA: In zsh:\necho /usr/local/bin/python3(:A)\n\nOr more robustly, in case there are backslashes in the path:\nprint -lr -- /usr/local/bin/python3(:A)\n\nThis prints the absolute path to the file with all symbolic links resolved (i.e. it's equivalent to GNU readlink -f, not to a plain readlink).\nExplanation: the parentheses (\u2026) at the end of a word surround a list of glob qualifiers. A colon : in the list of glob qualifiers starts a list of history modifiers. The history modifier A turns the given path into an absolute path and resolves all symbolic links.\nIf this is the python3 in your $PATH, you can save typing with equals expansion.\necho =python3(:A)\n\nEven if you aren't running zsh, you can invoke it just for that.\nzsh -c 'echo /usr/local/bin/python3(:A)\n\nor (putting the history modifier directly on the parameter expansion)\nzsh -c 'echo $0:A' /usr/local/bin/python3\n\n\npwd -P can work as well, but only for a (symlink to a) directory. pwd only prints information about the current directory. It doesn't take an argument. So it's useless for a regular file, and for a directory you need to change into it first.\n(cd some/where && pwd -P)\n\nWith find, I don't even know what you're trying to do.\n\nA: This resolves recursively and returns an absolute path:\n$ python\n>>> import os\n>>> os.path.realpath(\"/usr/local/bin/python3\")\n\nOr the non-interactive version:\npython -c \"import os; print(os.path.realpath('/usr/local/bin/python3'))\"\n\n\nA: Maybe this discussion on Stack Overflow is of help: How to resolve symbolic links in a shell script\nIn particular, please consider this answer.\n\nA: There are other answers using a python one-liner, or suggesting to install GNU programs using homebrew so you can have access to readlink -f or realpath. A recent update to macOS (12.3) has apparently introduced readlink -f natively as well.\nDeveloping a solution in Bash to do the job across more platforms is a tricky problem, but the following canonpath function correctly handles the edge cases that cause some simpler solutions to fail:\ncanonpath() (\n    # Print absolute canonical path, like GNU's `readlink -f`\n    # - target may be symlink, file or directory; path may contain ., .., symlinks\n    tgt=${1:?Non-null path required for canonpath}\n    [[ -e $tgt ]] || { echo >&2 \"target path must exist\"; return 2; }\n\n    # resolve symlink(s) at basename (possible chain)\n    while [[ -L $tgt ]]; do\n        tgt_dir=$(dirname -- \"$tgt\")\n        tgt=$(readlink \"$tgt\")\n\n        # handle relative symlink and tgt_dir=/\n        [[ ${tgt:0:1} == / ]] || tgt=${tgt_dir%/}/$tgt\n    done\n\n    _canon_dir() ( builtin cd -P \"$1\" &>/dev/null && pwd; )\n\n    if [[ -d $tgt ]]; then\n        # handle paths like this/is/a/link/..\n        printf '%s\\n' \"$(_canon_dir \"$tgt\")\"\n\n    elif [[ -f $tgt ]]; then\n        printf '%s/%s\\n' \"$(_canon_dir \"$(dirname -- \"$tgt\")\")\" \"$(basename -- \"$tgt\")\"\n\n    else\n        echo >&2 \"unknown file type\"\n        return 3\n    fi\n)\n\nTesting examples:\n# use `set -vx` if you want to see the gory details of unwinding the paths\n# can also compare against `greadlink -f` if you have installed it with homebrew\n\ncanonpath /var\n# outputs /private/var on macOS\n\nln -s ~/Documents /tmp/alink\ncanonpath /tmp/alink/..\n# outputs HOME path as expected\n\nln -s /etc /tmp/e\nmkdir /tmp/a && cd /tmp/a\nln -s ../e b\ncd ..\ncanonpath a/b\n# outputs /private/etc on macOS\n\ntouch /tmp/f\ncd /tmp/a\nln -s ../f\ncd ..\ncanonpath a/f\n# outputs /private/tmp/f on macOS\n# rm e f a/b a/f && rmdir a\n\nHandling paths that don't exist\nThere is a small difference in functionality between the canonpath function above and GNU's readlink -f, in that canonpath explicitly requires that the path must exist. readlink -f allows the final path element to be a broken symlink, or simply non-existent. The function could be adapted to accommodate this functionality, but I suggest simply testing for path existence before calling canonpath, and passing the parent directory of a non-existent path if necessary.\n\nA: You may use readlink -f. It recurses through all the links. Suppose the link is to a path that is further a link.

It should work great. If you want something that looks vaguely like a dock/taskbar/GNOME panel, it won't replace that.\n\nA: http://brawersoftware.com/products/ubar\nI was impressed with this. It is the closest thing to a task bar replacement I found. Some of its behavior annoyed me so I did not purchase it at the end of the trial. You may fare diffently.\nThe DOCK is rather ill conceived for a variety of reasons, but programs leaving the dock when open is a huge one. Finding open windows is OSX is far more difficult than in Windows. alt-tab > cmd+tab then cmd+~. Seeing the window clearly on the task bar is also nice.\nEDIT: I found this forum while looking for a replacement for ubar. I was unable to find one worth a crap. So I ended up buying Ubar, even tho it has some issues. Even with its issues it is better than the dock. The dock is a common complaint for windows users; this isnt a case of stubborn users rejecting change or a different way of doing things. This is a case of the taskbar really being the better way fulfill these functions. \n\nA: HyperDock gives you window previews for each running app in the dock, which helps tremendously. \n\n\nA: Ubar is very nice.

{"text": "Q: Do iOS apps crash regularly? Is this normal? I've been having some trouble with one of the third-party apps on my iPod Touch 4gen, and realized that a lot of apps I use (which isn't many) have been spontaneously exiting, recently.  Safari and Youtube both did this a few times today.\nIs this normal?  iOS apps tend to go back to what they were doing, so it's not that big a deal, but perhaps it's indicative of some hardware or software issue.\nI'm using iOS 4.2.1.  I don't remember it being quite this bad on 4.1, but that could well just be my imagination.\nI looked for crash logs on my computer, but there's been no crash logs created in over a week, even for apps which I know have crashed many times since then.  I don't know what that means, if anything.\nShould I be concerned?  Is there anything I can do?  Is there some kind of \"is my iPod completely &#@!ed?\" diagnostic I should run?  I realize this is kind of a vague question.\n\nA: It could be a low memory issue. iOS is supposed to manage memory automatically, but I've found that it's not always perfect. Try quitting every single app and restart the device (hold the power button down for several seconds, then slide to power off, then power on again) to see if that fixes it.\n\nA: Until recently, iOS apps had no automatic memory management mechanism. Thus, developers had to track memory allocations and release them manually. Most developers were good with this. Apple provides tools to check for various kinds of leaks. This is in contrast to Mac apps, that do have semi-automatic memory management via garbage collection.\nSome iOS developers did not perform enough testing, or could not find the cause of the leaks, and the App Store checks only for content, not app malfunctions, although of course, if an app is DOA, it is rejected.\nWith iOS 5, the situation for iOS developers improved. A new memory management system called Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) was introduced. iOS runtime takes care of memory management in app.\nApple provides a handy tool in Xcode to convert apps to make use of ARC.\nSo, developers now can improve their apps so that the only crashing that happens is with virtual race cars!\n\nA: I browsed on internet and found that app crashing is associated process to low memory and that's why to adjust the processing speed, it simply shuts off the process. Then reboot, refresh and blah blah blah....\nI found 2 main causes:\n\n*\n\n*Refreshing rate: I think iOS devices use Dynamic Ram which needs refreshing/rebooting. When we switch on the iOS device. iOS loads and we never shut it off so the OS stays in RAM. Considering this with PC. We boot and OS comes to RAM, we start process and then after using it we shut down. It means every process which was in RAM was sent back to permanent memory with OS as well.\nWe generally do not shut off the iPad and that's why the OS has a permanent sector in RAM, As the RAM is dynamic it needs to be refreshed but we do not do. Hence it's virtual memory becomes too low and hanging occurs.\n\n\n*Single tasking device: one process at a time. So earlier devices do hang and applications crash.\nLet me know your comments.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4832", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}
{"text": "Q: iPhoto and unknown RAW Formats I have a Camera that supports RAW (Panasonic Lumix FZ35), but sadly iPhoto (and Aperture) don't support this format.\nShort of reporting Feedback to Apple and hoping for the best, is there any other way to make iPhoto work with this RAW Format, like a \"Plugin\" that integrates neatly into iPhoto?\nI want to avoit having to use Photoshop to edit/convert them to JPG and then put those JPGs into iPhoto.\n\nA: A lot of cameras come with software to convert their RAW files to other formats. If your's comes with conversion then see if it supports regular TIFF. \nYou might want to look into GIMP, which is a graphic program from the *nix world that runs under X11 on the Macintosh. It's very similar to Photoshop but is free. It has some auto conversion capability and/or might be able to read your camera's RAW files. GraphicConverter might be another option. It's got a long list of formats it supports and converts between.\nConverting to JPG changes the file format in ways that make it a lot less flexible. I have my own photography company, and only shoot RAW when I'm doing serious work, because I need the flexibility of non-jpeg. I convert to Photoshop format and do all my manipulation in their format, then save a copy of the final image in Adobe's Photoshop format, then make another copy and save it as JPG, ready for sending to the place that does my prints. RAW and TIFF support better color and greater gamut (light range from dark to light) and you can see the difference after converting to jpeg so I want to avoid the conversion until the last step.\n\nA: Converting to something that isn't RAW means you'll lose data. GIMP and Photoshop are essentially raster image editors so you lose that very useful camera data.\nSilkypix is another good alternative for RAW editing and conversion and it supports a huge list of cameras. It is a non-destructive editor so any editing you do leaves the original file unharmed.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4834", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

I'm not even sure that PDFs have, embedded, a concept of \"line\". I think that Preview tries to detect that for the purposes of selecting text (major improvements on this from 10.5 to 10.6).\nYou could set up a program (AppleScript, Automator, etc.), that simulates pressing the down arrow a certain number of times.

In your example you need to boot from Ubuntu.\nTurns out your Mac uses EFI instead of the archaic BIOS.

External_Drive_B has 74GB of free space. The desired end result is to move all the files from A to B so that A can be wiped and put to use in another location. \nDrag & Drop approach is to open one Finder window for A, another Finder window for B, highlight all the files on A, then command-click-drag them to B.\nmv approach is to open a Terminal session and invoke \nmkdir /Volumes/External_Drive_B/A_legacy\nmv /Volumes/External_Drive_A/* /Volumes/External_Drive/B/A_legacy/\n\nDoes Drag & Drop do anything behind-the-scenes in addition to the copy and remove, or is it strictly a thing of Beauty? \nAnswered by jmlumpkin below: \nThey differ! Drag & Drop brings the metadata, mv does not. I tested this by adding a phrase to the Spotlight Comments section on a text file's Get Info dialog. When I dragged and dropped the file across volumes, the phrase was present when I invoked Get Info on the destination; but when it used mv, the phrase was missing when I invoked Get Info on the destination.\n\nA: Do not use mv or drag&drop for moving data between volumes.\nIf anything bad happens during the operation, you will end up with half the data here and half the data there, and it will be hard to figure out where to restart. If this is done over the network, you may not even still have all the data on either volume.\nDo a copy (command line or drag&drop), and after that succeeded, delete the source. \n\nA: In earlier versions of the Mac OS, Dragging and Dropping a file was actually closer to the 'ditto' command to retain resource forks, etc. \n\nA: The end result is probably the same, but I would guess that edge cases might be treated differently, also depending on which mv you use (the default in /bin/ or a GNU version in /sw/bin/ from fink, or from macports, etc.)\nFor example, an OS X alias or resource forks might not be treated properly by the unix toolchain, and there are probably cases where low-level unix file things might not be handled by the OS X drag-and-drop.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4880", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}

{"text": "Q: NeoOffice extremely slow in Mac OS X 10.6.5 I've installed the latest version of NeoOffice 3.2.1 on my May, 2010 2.66 GHz Core i7 MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.5 (8.0 GB RAM).\nRegardless of what I do, whether its Writer, Calc, or Impress, the application's response has been extremely \"laggy\", (i.e. the exact opposite of snappy...can't think of a good word for it). It always takes close to a second before anything responds to a mouse click, and moving/resizing images is a pain also because the response is so slow.\nQuestion: Is this typical OpenOffice.org/NeoOffice behavior in Mac OS X? Or is there a way to optimise its performance? I doubt it's my hardware being insufficient!\n\nA: I would also take a look at LibreOffice, which is the more open fork of OpenOffice, having used OpenOffice and NeoOffice, LibreOffice is cleaner on OS X then OpenOffice, and does not suffer from the slowness that seems to plague NeoOffice.\n\nA: I do not agree with any of the opinions provided here regarding NeoOffice. \nI have used NeoOffice for eight years, as each new version came out. Today I also use OpenOffice and LibreOffice, and I can tell you from my experience that NeoOffice is in no way inferior to those other programs.\nI find NeoOffice to be faster than OpenOffice.org (which has all but been discontinued in its development) and LibreOffice. NeoOffice's strength is that it is better integrated into Mac OS X than either OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice. It feels more \"Mac-like\" and uses Mac features, such as the system-wide spell check and Services in some cases. NeoOffice is quirky in places, but the full release version of NeoOffice is not buggy. It is quite stable. Of course if you are working with a beta version of any program, you can expect bugs. I'm using NeoOffice 3.2.1 beta right now myself.\nFurthermore, the latest version in beta, 3.2.1, removes much of the deprecated code and replaces it with more up-to-date methods.\nhttp://neowiki.neooffice.org/index.php/Mac_OS_X_Upgrade_Issues\n\nNeoOffice developers have reimplemented all of the text layout code\n  using the \"CoreText\" functions in NeoOffice 3.2 Beta.\n\nI am upset with the tone of many comments made here. Several people who admit to never having actually used NeoOffice have condemned it as being buggy or inferior and say \"Why not use something else?\". \nWhy do other posters spread slander and gossip about a program they have no direct experience with? It would be better for you not to post at all if you admit that you don't know what you are talking about.\n\nA: There is a specific reason that NeoOffice, for several years, hung on to deprecated code. This is that NeoOffice was, for several years, the only fork of OpenOffice.org that would run on PowerPC Macs as well as Intel Macs. OpenOffice for Mac, since its first version for Mac, would only run on Intel Macs, so the developers of NeoOffice deliberately back-ported the OpenOffice code to provide NeoOffice to users that still had PowerPC Macs. This was a valuable service to those users.\nTherefore compatibility with PowerPC Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 was a design decision aimed at providing G3, G4 and G5 Mac owners a free office suite. It was the only such program available for that hardware.\nIt is only in 2011, with version 3.2 and higher, that NeoOffice is being developed more strictly with Intel Macs in mind, on the understanding that today there are very few users who still rely on PowerPC Macs.\n\nA: NeoOffice works ok, but it uses certain technology that is deprecated by Apple. I was trying to find out about that, when I realized that it\u2019s in the front page of NeoOffice. It\u2019s kind of they know that their Java Implementation is using older (and deprecated) APIs\u2026\nIn any case, here\u2019s the neowiki entry about NeoOffice potential problems with Lion, which describes the three deprecated services being used. \nTL;DR Version: They don\u2019t use NSPasteboard and CoreText\u2026 this is fail. And of course the future of Java in OS X is, although \u201cguaranteed to exist\u201d, uncertain in compatibility levels.

{"text": "Q: will running Google Latitude (or any similar app) in the background significantly affect battery life? I have installed Google Latitude and am wondering how much quicker my battery will run flat? I know the way Apple implemented its \"mutitasking\" framework minimises the impact?\n\nA: Specifically, the Latitude app (and other background location-updating apps) register themselves for location updates \"on significant location change\". \nHow the phone knows the location has changed significantly is when the phone does a cell tower handoff. It's moved enough that it's out of range of the tower it was talking to and its service is handed to the next tower. At that time, if any apps are registered for location updates, the phone fires up its GPS, gets its coordinates, and feeds them to those apps. Those apps then get to do a LITTLE work with what they were told.\nWhen iOS 4 came out, I wrote a little app to play with this API. Basically it just sat in the background and recorded lat/lng for every update it got. Between my office and my house (like 10 miles) it got eight or nine sets of coordinates.\nThat means eight or nine times (call it once a mile or so) that the phone has to fire up the GPS chip, listen for signals from outer space, and do something with them. That obviously takes up more electricity than if it didn't have to do that.\nIs it MUCH more? You know what? Not really. I charge my phone when it needs it (rather than, say, nightly), and I didn't notice it needing it more than usual when my little app was running. So my guess is that Latitude won't be a major battery suck. But it'll definitely suck some.\n\nA: Yes, any app that runs in the background needs some attention from the CPU, and this costs battery power. Further, if the app needs GPS and/or 3G service or other battery-intensive services, then of course the battery will deplete even faster.\nBut depending on your situation and circumstances, this can be a trade-off that's worth it, especially if you only need to do this for shorter periods of time.\n\nA: Due to the way multitasking is done in iOS 4, Apple tried to implement it in a way to reduce this as much as possible. For example, with the latitude app, it can only poll and post location information at certain intervals. \nSo, yes, any background app actually working (like GPS or Upload type apps) will use a little more resources than a phone not running them. \nBut, if one were to run this type of app fully in the background (for example, how some jailbroken apps do), it would be using a significant amount more of power. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4942", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: How do I download photos from my iPhone? I find it very complicated to move photos taken with my iPhone into my pc's photo library. \nI used to take photos with a compact camera, and pc applications could very easily import the photos because the compact camera shows up as a USB disk -- this way, importing photos was almost a one-click process!\nBut the iPhone doesn't show up as a disk, and that makes it very messy. I've tried to sync using iTunes, but syncing is not what I want to achieve. I want to move the pics away from the iPhone! I've tried moving them using iFunBox, and while that works, it creates the problem that all photos to get a new timestamp which ruins my photo library.\nQuestion:\nHow can I easily move photos and videos from iPhone to PC without using iTunes syncing, and keeping the files' original timestamps? \nClarifications:\nI'm using Windows 7, and the phone is already jailbroken. I'm looking for a solution that will allow Windows to see the phone's native file system as a normal USB drive from which I can import the pics&vids using a Windows program -- or any other solution that comes as close as possible to this.\nUpdate:\nBased on the solutions so far it is clear that extra pc applications won't help. What I need instead is some way of getting the damn phone to present itself to Windows using a drive letter, just like any other disk resource or compact camera does. \nThis is a good example where I think Apple is being too restrictive with their products; if people want access, then let them have it. If they break it, it's their problem. That's what backups are for. \"It just works\" only works if you stick by Apple's intended use, and that doesn't include Windows drive letters.\n\nA: When I connect my iPhone to a Windows machine, it does appear as a digital camera and allows me to copy files from the DCIM folder or to use the \"Import Pictures\" option from Windows.\nI just tried this in a Windows 7 VM and was able to view all the pictures in my Camera Roll.\nFrom there, I could drag and drop pictures to my desktop.\nI don't have iTunes installed in the Windows 7 VM.\nIt works the same way in my Windows XP machine, at work. There it is a physical machine and I have iTunes installed, but I can copy the pictures from the iPhone without syncing, anyway.\n\nA: What about this solution?\n\nWith the plug-in you can manage music, videos, podcasts and photos for your iPod. You can >add all those files to your iPod, delete and organize them into playlists as well as smart >playlists. \nInstall WinAmp + mliPod on your computer\nTo manage your iPod you need two\n  files, WinAmp itself and the above\n  mentioned plug-in mliPod.\nDownload\n  directly from WinAmp\nDownload mliPod\n\n\nA: Creation and modification dates in the Finder or in Windows are never completely reliable as they can be changed by almost anything (as you have noticed). The photos have the real time stamps held internally in the files themselves and any image management software should be going by those, not by what you see in the OS' file system,\nApplications like iFunBox on Windows and Image Capture on the Mac to manage file downloads from devices are really the only alternatives to iTunes or iLife.\nUPDATE: Do not jailbreak your iPhone. It's usually unnecessary and it voids your warranty. One viable option is to look at PhoneView which offers a disk mode. You don't say what platform you're on, but I've used that in the past on my Mac before I purchased iLife.\nI think no matter what, the creation and modification dates in the OS are going to be problematic for you because the files will be new to the OS.\n\nA: Have you seen the free app, WiFi Photo Transfer? \nNot sure about timestamps on video, but it's great for quickly grabbing photos and video off your iOS device.  Especially since it will zip up photos.\n\nA: I think you can do this by using Diskaid - http://www.digidna.net/products/diskaid \nIt works for Win7 and for both jailbroken and non-j... phones.\nYou could also give Sharepod at getsharepod.com a try.\n\nA: Here's how I fixed it in Windows 7:\n* Press the Windows Start Button\n* Select Devices and Printers\n* Find the Apple iPhone icon (for me it was under Unspecified)\n* Right-click\n* Select Troubleshoot  \nThat fixed it and then I was able to browse the phone like a regular drive\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4945", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "9"}}

I installed the bootcamp stuff from my Leopard DVD and I updated my bootcamp to 2.0. with Apple Software Update but the Microphone is still not working. \nHow should I make the microphone work?\n\nA: Are you sure you have all the bootcamp drivers installed on the PC side of things?\nAlso, what type of microphone is it? Are there updated drivers for it?\nIs Windows even recognizing a device is attached? Can you choose it and tell it to find the newest drivers?\nEDIT:\nGo to ControlPanel > SoundAndAudioDevices and click the 'Voice' tab.

(One possible extra step: have to go to \"advanced\" and check-mark a box for \"boost mic.\")\n\nI then determined to try the microphone with headphones on. Sound comes through crystal clear to other people with them on. I don't understand why, but just know that it works fine now. So try some headphones for a temporary fix.\n\nIf none of this works for you, it seems that there is no fix for this issue yet and it will have to take another update to the Windows Bootcamp drivers for this issue to be resolved.\n\nA: Having looked around a long time for answer to this question, I finally sorted mine out today.

If you've got a headset connected, and you've got this problem, then I would assume the only thing you would see immediately is \"Headset Microphone\".\nNow right click in the box and you should find an option which says \"show disabled devices\". When I selected that, my on-board microphone showed up as disabled, but at least I finally had an icon for it. Then it's a matter of right clicking on the disabled microphone (icon), select Properties and near the bottom of that screen there is an options box, which should include \"Use this device (enable)\".

{"text": "Q: Kingston SV100S2/128G on MacBookPro 6,2 (late 2010) issue \n*\n\n*I just upgraded the harddrive with the Kingston SSD (100V series), did restore with Time Machine, immediately noticed the battery doesn't seem to play nice, it charges, but the time estimate is quite off. On a 100% full charge, it shows it can run shy of 3 hours, with the computer doing nothing. Another thing is it seems the battery drain is crazy fast.\n\n\nDoes anyone else have the same/similar issue?\nanother thing is, I am running Snow Leopard, and Trim support says \"no\", but it is supported on my drive. is that normal? \n\nA: OS X doesn\u2019t support the TRIM command (which is usually tied with the OS and an NTFS volume), however, a few benchmarking have apparently reach the conclusion that OS X\u2019s performance with an SSD drive is not affected like it was in Windows (with TRIM Disabled). \nIn other words, Windows without TRIM suffered massive performance degradation over time. With TRIM, Windows did well.\nOS X, on the other hand, having no TRIM support, didn\u2019t suffer the performance degradation in the first place. The interesting article can be found here at bit-tech.net.\nTLDR Version (and I quote): \n\nWhile we know SSD performance is affected by the OS - after all, you need Windows 7 for TRIM support - but for OS X not to suffer from performance degradation when it's using an SSD seeming stunning to the point of being difficult to believe.\n\n(Emphasis added)\nTRIM aside, your battery problem might be mitigated by a few things and there are a few recommendations about how to make it work better under OS X.\nThe original article is a blog post found here which I suggest you read for more detailed information.\nIn short: \n\n\n*\n\n*Modify Sleeping mode so it doesn\u2019t save the content of RAM to drive when closing the lid (if you do this and remove the battery while in sleep, you lose the ram contents and will have to restart your computer). \n\n*Hard Drive Sleep: turn it off, SSD has no reason to go to sleep.\n\n*Sudden Motion Sensor: You can also disable this, an SSD has no moving mechanical parts that may be affected in case of a sudden impact. \n\n*Enable noatime for SSD filesystems. This will make the SSD write less info. (If you\u2019re using FileVault make sure you read the article) \n\n*Spotlight: The article suggests disabling it if you don\u2019t use it, but I wouldn\u2019t do that. \nOn top of all that, I recommend you do a few things: \n\n\n*\n\n*Check this question and answers on this site about how to identify possible CPU processes that may be hogging your CPU and therefore eating your battery life. \n\n*Perform a full battery cycle charge. All the relevant information is in Apple\u2019s Battery Page, which is linked in this question on this site too, with some more interesting links you might want to follow. \nTo address your question, it shouldn\u2019t happen, as SSDs are usually more energy efficient than mechanical drives. I bet either spotlight or time machine are doing some work and draining your battery life. \nTry starting your machine in safe mode (hint: press \u21e7 shift after the chime) and monitor your battery life there. Don\u2019t forget to perform the battery tips before doing that. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4967", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: Why does Safari cache old pages on iPhone even after you've downloaded the new page? This may be a problem specific to Reddit.com, but I find that if I follow a link to another site on mobile safari and hit back, that only part of the time will I see the latest copy of the page.  A lot of times, I'll see a copy of the page from weeks ago that mobile Safari has cached for some reason.\nFor clarity this is what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*I visit reddit on March 1st in mobile Safari, click some links, everything works.\n\n*Later I visit reddit on March 3rd and I see the March 3rd homepage. \n\n*I click a link to visit another site off of reddit, and then click back to go back to reddit.com\n\n*I see the March 1st copy of reddit.com\n\n\nA: I would imagine this has something to do with Core Data, memory warnings, or both. If Apple is using its own kit, then it is saving the cache in a Core Data store, which is, essentially, an unordered set. My theory is that when you go to a site, Safari is going to the Core Data store and grabbing the first instance of the URL in question if it exists, which can be old, new, whatever. But since I also don't think that Apple would be nearly that sloppy, I'd say that every page attempts to cache, but the amount of data required to properly cache a site is beholden to memory warnings, which you, as the user, should never, ever see, only this time the newer page simply doesn't get cached and that's why you get random older pages in view.\nOkay, that was a bit technical. In short, I think Safari attempts to maintain a clean cache, but memory limitations of the device don't always allow that to happen.\n\nA: I'm having the same problem. If you goto Settings>Safari>Clear Cache it fixes it for a week or so. \nThe page it's happening to me on is http://www.google.com/m/ig which is my homepage in Safari I use for reading latest news and such.  \nAlso, Philip mentioned that it may be a memory problem, which may be the case on iOS4 but on my 3GS with iOS3, I never had memory problems and animations and such were excellent.

I want to organize them in groups, but I've read that some applications don't properly handle being put inside a folder.\n1) What is the truth to this statement? Is there a list of applications with known problems? Is this a thing of the past? Does FileVault have anything to do with it? (I have FileVault turned on)\n2) What alternatives do I have? How do you group your applications?\nI'm currently considering making some other folder in my home directory (maybe \"Shortcuts\"), with subfolders for groups, and inside of those subfolders making symlinks to applications in the /Applications directory. Then I would drag my Applications folder off my dock and replace it with the Shortcuts folder. Do you see anything wrong with that?\nIs there any mechanism built into Snow Leopard for grouping applications?\n\nA: A little off-topic, but I hardly ever launch Applications from the Finder.\nThey are either in the Dock, or you can get to them with Spotlight (or your favorite alternative app launcher).\n\nA: 1) The pre-installed Apple applications generally won't get updated by Software Update if they are moved. The Developer applications won't work properly if moved. I honestly haven't tried complex installs like Photoshop to see if they can be moved. But most applications that you download from a website as a zip or dmg can be installed where ever you like -- I tend to create an \"Applications\" folder in my home folder for those applications\n2) I think your suggestion is the recommended one. Note that the typical way to create what Mac OS X calls an \"alias\" (kind of like a windows shortcut, more like a unix soft link) is to \noption+command drag the icon to the destination. You could also have sub-folders in your shortcut folder -- \"Games,\" \"Productivity,\" \"Communications.\"\nOnce the Mac OS X App Store gets started, I think there will be more options for organizing app store apps.\n\nA: Very few 3rd party apps need to be in /Applications. You can usually tell as they don't look very Mac-ish, or are low-level requiring an installer and a reboot. I haven't seen any drag-and-drop apps that need to be there.\nI put everything I install in ~/local/Applications, and I have had zero problems.\nIf you want further classification/categorization, I think your suggestion of Aliases is the way to go. The advantage here is you can have the app appear in multiple places, for example, VLC could be filed under both an \"Audio\" and a \"Video\" folder.\n\nA: If you take your recommended route (basically making aliases to the apps and grouping them by folder), you could then add these folders to your dock, and basically have a folder for each group. Then clicking on one (say you have a group for network stuff like browsers and FTP clients), click on that - which would thing bring up the list for you to click the icon.\n\nA: My answer is as simple as the keystrokes I just used to look something up. (Note: Requires an application launcher such as the built-in Spotlight, or the free Alfred.app)\nCmd + Space, terenter \u21a9\nMy terminal is now open and I can proceed to run the commands I wanted to.\nTwo other favorites are goo / chr for my browser. But that's pretty much always open anyways. And if it isn't, I rarely invoke it directly, more often just by clicking a link.\n(Note: for Alfred, the default keystroke is Ctrl+Space instead of Cmd+Space)\n\nA: I use something called \"Overflow\" (15$) that expands the capacity of the dock.\n\nA: Folders for Applications is coming with Mac OS X Lion.

All the tools are on the Mac, as is the simulator program you'll need to test in.\nEven if you could somehow finagle the whole thing running in Windows you still need a Mac to submit to Apple to get it on the App Store.\nCheapest scenario you're looking $699 for a Mac Mini and $99 for the iOS Developer Program (which you won't need until you want to run the thing on a real phone). You can go cheaper on the hardware if you buy it used but something to keep in mind is that it must be an Intel-based Mac running Leopard (10.5) or higher.\n\nA: Depending on what you want to do, you can develop web apps that look pretty much the same as an actual application, start from the home screen and even hide the navigation and URL bars. Take a look at Glyphboard, for an example.\nNative apps require Mac OS X, as far as I know.\n\nA: Yes, you can. Check out this website called macincloud.com. Most people are trying to install Mac OS to PC hardware, sometimes it works, the drawback for that is newer mac updates often break the installation. macincloud.com actually allows you to rent a mac and access the Mac remotely. Therefore you always have the latest Mac OS and it is a good way to start developing iphone apps right away since you are actually using a native Mac system. Hope that helps.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4992", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}
{"text": "Q: Running .NET binary with mono When I have abc.exe generated from C#/Mono source, I use 'mono abc.exe'.\nIs there a way to run abc.exe with 'abc.exe' not 'mono abc.exe'? I mean, when I run 'abc.exe', can I make 'mono abc.exe' called automatically?\n\nA: See this link\nBasically what you have to do is to use one of the Mono tools (mkbundle is a generic one while macpack is designed to work on Mac OS X) to link all your application executables, resources and dll in a single executable file that can be later run as a single app.\nFrom the macpack doc:\nmacpack is a tool that must be used to bundle Cocoa# applications into Double-Clickable, Finder friendly, bundles on Mac OS X. It bundles static libraries and resources, as well as generates a basic info.plist into the .app bundle.\nFor example the following commands are used to build the CurrencyConverter.exe into an application bundle:\n$ mcs -g -debug+ CurrencyConverter.cs -out:CurrencyConverter.exe -pkg:cocoa-sharp\n$ rm -rf CurrencyConverter.app\n$ macpack -m:2 -o:.  -r:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/    \n  libCocoaSharpGlue.dylib -r:CurrencyConverter.nib -n:CurrencyConverter \n  -a:CurrencyConverter.exe\n\nThe resulting CurrencyConverter.app is just another Mac OS X application as far as the Finder is concerned, and can be opened from Finder, or launched from Terminal using the open -a CurrencyConverter command.\n\nA: Improving Calavera\u2019s answer to allow you to do it with a parameter, the script should look like:\n#!/bin/bash\nmono $1\n\nThat way you can do:\n./abc.sh name_of_the_app.exe\n\nI would have added this as a comment, but the format would have been lost\n\nA: I don't have a lot of experience with mono but you'll probably have to create an executable shell script that does the mono call for you.  Something like:\n$ vi abc.sh\n\n#!/bin/bash\n#abc.sh\nmono abc.exe\n:wq\n\n$ chmod +x abc.sh\n$ ./abc.sh\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4996", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}
{"text": "Q: Why automatically adjust brightness doesn't work after I change the brightness Why automatically adjust brightness doesn't work after I change the brightness manually using the hot keys although it's set to do so in the displays configuration?\n\nA: I have noticed a few times that if I turn the brightness up very high, the auto adjust is not nearly as noticeable as it is on lower settings. \n\nA: Theoretically it should, but it is all relative. The ambient light sensor turns the display brighter when its bright outside and dim when it's dark inside. The thing is, the Mac is designed to cater to the user, because supposedly a human being knows what it wants better than a little $.005 photo sensor, so the buttons on the keyboard (F1 and F2) override the ambient light settings for a set period of time, and then still until the light conditions change drastically enough to cause the auto-adjust to kick in again. Going from dark screen to bright screen is almost immediate, but the Mac will take a while to go from bright screen to dark screen except on opening the clamshell or waking from sleep. This kind of makes sense when you think about the real world situations where this would happen.\nSo try this with auto-adjust ON and make sure \"dim screen after inactivity\" in Energy Saver prefs is off: \n\n\n*\n\n*In a really dark room (no light except from computer), open the computer and manually raise the brightness to maximum, screen and keyboard backlight too if equipped.\n\n*Hold a small headed, bright flashlight (Mini Maglight or smaller) to the ALS, which is located to the left of the iSight camera on glass-paneled macs or in the speaker grille on older macs.\n\n*If the keyboard backlight goes off then the ALS IS WORKING\n\n*Lower DISPLAY backlight only to 1 above minimum level (minimum turns backlight completely off)\n\n*Put flashlight over ALS\n\n*You should see IMMEDIATE increase in backlight to full level.\n\n*Remove flashlight, display should readjust immediately to ambient level. Notice how after auto-adjusting the manual override is overridden so you can repeat steps 5 and 7 over and over again for entertainment ;)\n\n\nIf the steps above produce no results, restart computer and repeat tests. If still no results take to Apple certified repair center or Apple Store for repair which will likely be covered under warranty.\n\nA: From my experience, if you put your head between the camera and the light the sensor will trigger the auto adjust no matter what.\n\nA: After manually changing the brightness you need a way to trigger the light sensor. Just place your hand on the camera area, which will make the brightness dimmer and once you remove your hand, the screen brightness will automatically adjust itself.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4998", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "9"}}
{"text": "Q: How is a large, spread out company supposed to work with the iOS Developer Program? I work for a company which has several offices in various parts of the country (USA).\nThe division I'm part of wants to get an Apple iOS Developer Program license.\nAnother division (in another office/state) already has a license.\nWhen we go to that division they said it would be better/easier to just apply for our own license, which made sense.\nWhen we apply to get the license we have to use our legal company name.\nApple shot us down - because the other division already has the license under the legal company name. Which also makes sense.\nApple is being Apple in that it's basically impossible to get someone on the phone to discuss what we're supposed to do here. So my guess is that what we're going to have to do is piggy-back off of the license the other division is using.\nBesides sounding like a big huge hassle (coordinating with coworkers in another office/state whom you've never met) I'm not really sure what the logistics are. Are we supposed to be able to use this one license on every Mac we own across the company? (which luckily there's not that many of) Or is there a seat limit? The end goal is the App Store, but should we have gotten an Enterprise license? If so, is there any way to \"upgrade\" to that if the other division just got the standard one? Is someone from the other division supposed to be the \"admin\" of the license? Or can we all be added as users to their license?\nFor a large, spread out company with divisions in many different offices and states, how are you supposed to work with the iOS Developer Program?\n(I asked this on SO as well, and someone recommended I ask it here, too. Let me know if this is unacceptable)\n\nA: A $99 \"company\" developer membership allows the administrator of the account to set up many \"developer\" accounts. You should get the administrator of that account (whoever set it up originally, most likely) to create accounts for each of your developers.\nYou might need to share the admin account for things like provisioning and app submission, but for most of your daily work, you can have your own login that shares the developer membership.\n\nA: Since Apple has spoken that each \"company\" only gets one developer program, you will be forced to share or create a new company.\nThe initial burden of forming a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of establishing a legal entity is something that independent developers do for less than $500 and they get professional, but canned help.\nYou'll have to run this by your finance and legal teams to know how painful this will be for your company's particular situation. It's fairly simple for an individual to have an LLC or S corp fall under personal income tax and handling the filing paperwork with the state government is more of a light administrative burden. It could easily be more costly and complicated for a real corporation to set up a child company - but that's the direct route to getting your own developer account.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4999", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}

You can use a command to\n  open anything you can open by\n  double-clicking, including\n  applications, files, and Web sites.\n  You can also write scripts and add\n  them to the folder.\n\nIn regards to \"How does OS X know what command to run?

{"text": "Q: Can I upgrade my 2008 Mac Pro completely? Hey everyone, I have a 2008 Mac Pro/2.83hzXEON(8)/8800GT512mb.\nIs it possible for me to upgrade this machine to newer hardware, since it is Intel based? What would it entail to put a newer processor, ram and video card in this machine? Is it worth it?\nThanks\n\nA: I purchased a 2008 Mac Pro (3,1) with single quad core processor (Intel Xeon E5462 @ 2.80 GHz\n1 processor, 4 cores), and 4GB of RAM running at 667 MHz.  It produced the following GeekBench 3 results:\nSingle Core: 1559,  Multi Core: 3927\nI performed the following upgrades in stages and re-ran GeekBench 3 to get a base-line of what each upgrade offered in incremental performance.\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgraded RAM to 8GB to populate slots 1 & 2 on both memory cards.  Result was a single core score of: 1647, and a multi core score of: 5743  (pretty substantial increase in memory read/write speeds).\n\n*Next, I upgraded the CPU to 2 Intel Xeon E5472 @ 3.00 GHz (2 processors, 8 cores) which resulted in a single core score of: 1740 and a multi-core score of: 11638\n\n*Next, I upgraded the memory to 800MHz and 16GB, again populating the first two memory slots on both cards with the same memory resulting in the following pick up:  Single Core score: 1778, and Multi-Core score: 12441.\nThat is it for the Geek Bench measurable results.  Above should give you a pretty good guide on the increases you can achieve in your system just by changing the RAM config, or upgrading your CPUs.\nFor two other upgrades I would have to turn to Nova Bench to show the details.\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgraded video card from NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT GPU to the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 285. The 8800 was scoring at 405 fps, and scored a 139 on Nova Bench, whereas the GTX 285 scored 627 fps and a score of 191.  The GTX 285 doesn't have EFI support and therefore doesn't show the Apple logo during startup, but the cost/value savings of not showing that is good enough for me to forgo watching the Apple logo during startup.  The card is a 1GB DDR congif and just works (I had to add an extra power connector to power it, but the Mac Pro logic board has two and supports this card's power requirements stock).\n\n\nProbably the most significant increase that I noticed was the addition of an SSD;  unfortunately this isn't going to GeekBench or NovaBench a score that adequately demonstrates the perceived speed increase that I see.  I believe this is likely the most significant improvement one can make to any older system to see immediate and meaningful improvements.  I added a 500GB SSD, and turned it into a Fusion Drive using instructions I found using Google.  The load time for the OS went from 50 seconds to 21 seconds, and launching of some applications is instantaneous vs. 5 to 10 seconds.  Everything appears to be a bit faster.  This is so much the case, I purchased a bunch of 128GB SSDs for about $70 and moved ever computer in the house to use them for the startup partition and virtual memory manager utilizing a secondary hard disk for larger applications and data.\nHere are the specs reported by NovaBench for reference:\nDrive Write Speed (read speeds are going to be significantly higher on the SSD): \nStock Hard Drive: 44 MB/s\n7200 RPM Hard Drive: 75 MB/s\nFusion Drive: 180 MB/s  (the SSD by itself was the same as MacOS manages the SSD to always have free space available which should result in SSD drive speeds for writing data;  data reads will toggle between SSD and hard drive speeds depending on whether the data is on the SSD or hard disk when being read).\nThat is it on my upgrade.  I used the guides on FixIt for the take apart on the Mac Pro CPU upgrades, and everything else I already knew how to do.\nTotal cost for my new computer is about $900 and includes the cost of two 24 inch displays + my time to do the work.  \n\nA: I concur with your observations. I was ready to toss this 2008 dual 2.8 Quad Core machine as it seemed deathly slow compared to my PC. As a last ditch effort to save it I upgraded to Yosemite, threw in 12 GB of 800MHz DDR2 Ram, a 500 GB Samsung SSD boot disk, and an nVidia GeForce GTX770 which I bought on eBay. The machine once again rocks. I couldn't be happier with it. It is like a new machine and responds as well as my fast PC.\nDon't listen to all the bad reviews about Yosemite: it seems to have a very good handle on optimization for older machines. The total cost for my upgrades was about $800 and was a steal compared to the cost of a new Mac Pro.  \n\nA: Certain upgrades are possible, but it\u2019s not that simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Accelerate your Mac is a nice source of information, you can find them here.\n\n*ANandtech did change the CPU of a Mac Pro.\n\n*OWC Mac Sales does have memory upgrades (there are others).\n\n*Video card: Unless you want to experiment with modified firmwares, your only choice in that model is the ATI 4870, which is considerably faster than the regular NVidia (it\u2019s very noticeable in x-plane and 3d applications) but still lagging behind the \u201clatest offerings\u201d. \nAccording to Wikipedia: \"The Mac Pro, as with other Macintosh platforms, requires Mac OS X firmware. That is to say, a PCIe video card designed exclusively for other operating systems will not work properly under Mac OS X without appropriate drivers and/or firmware\u201d\nSadly, no other video card has that, other than the Apple\u2019s offerings. But If you google around there are some posts about people who managed to make other cards work. \n\n\n*\n\n*Forget about upgrading your Motherboard, as it\u2019s a custom design. \n\n*Hard drives/SuperDrives are generic and can be replaced, as you may have already guessed.\n\n*Any other component is probably \u201ccustom\u201d designed for a Mac Pro (the power supply for example) and you won\u2019t be able to get away with it\u2026\nIs it worth?\nI have an early 2008 Mac Pro with 2x4 Intel XEON 2.8 and 10GB RAM. I\u2019ve upgraded the RAM (from the lame 2GB to 10 @ OWC liked above), and I ordered the machine with the NVIDIA card (8800? I don\u2019t remember), which was the only option other than the stock ATI2600 or something lame like that. \nA couple of years later, the NVIDIA died (the Apple guy told me it had bugs and used to fail), so I got the new ATI 4780 512MB (it was 100\u20ac less expensive than the out of warranty NVIDIA apple replacement). The difference was really noticeable in 3d apps. \nI haven\u2019t thought about upgrading the CPUs because getting faster XEONs (I wouldn\u2019t be able to upgrade to Nehalem or anything new) won\u2019t really make a big difference for me.\nI use a SSD and 4 Hard Drives in the bays, if that counts as an upgrade (my original drive was 750gb, up from the stock 500). \nI brought it with the Bluetooth/Wifi module (it was optional back then) and tho I haven\u2019t used it a lot, it came in handy in a few occasions. \nOS X Doesn\u2019t support SLI/Crossfire for using more than 1 video card in parallel (you can install more than one, but it\u2019s not the same thing), so forget about getting two super video cards for running crysis y super-top-ultra-maximum quality. \nConclusion\nYes, if you upgrade the RAM to something other than the 2GB and yes to the video card if you do 3d intensive stuff. Expos\u00e9 will work fine on the NVIDIA8800 you have, but X-Plane (among other 3D things) will be noticeably faster with a new video card. \n\nA: My 2008 Mac pro 2.8 8 core 16g ram has been upgraded with PCI-e bus ssd's (2x500gb) and a 2 gb gtx 680 video card. 4 bays have 1tb or 2tb sata drives. driving 3 23 inch apple monitors.\nWith El capitan its stable and fast. maxing out black magic disk speed tests across the board.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5004", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "9"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I keep bugs out of the MacBook Pro's hinge vent? I've noticed that some flying bugs have an irritating habit of crawling into the hinge vent on my MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2009).\nI don't know what possesses them to go in there, maybe it looks like an inviting hidey-hole, but they obviously end up dying from the heat. I'm paranoid they'll eventually clog something. Bless the designer for the nice design, but it's next to impossible to fish dead bugs out of there! Ironically, because of the silent design there's also no huge gust of hot air to persuade them not to try climbing in there.\nThe problem is made worse when there's a light above the table drawing them in, but even without it the screen is a bright enough draw. I've seen them crash into the screen (or fall from an above light), and then make a mad dash straight into the vent. It's infuriating!\nHas anyone else experienced this problem with bugs and that hinge vent? How did you de-bug yours? My only workaround so far has been to surround myself with tons of other lights on to keep them as scattered as possible...\nEdit: Looking back at this question I'm disappointed that I forgot to include any regional info. At the time I was in a house in the country in Queensland, Australia. Bugs inside the house are the norm rather than the exception.

{"text": "Q: How should I set up my coding environment for PHP, mySQL, and JavaScript development? I'm having trouble finding a coding environment that is comfortable and I'm hoping anyone has had the same problem. On my windows box at the office I've found my ideal coding environment that I really dig. VS2010 or Eclipse, Notepad++, WinScp, Fireftp is often everything I need. \nOn my macbook pro however, I've not yet found that environment that just says \"click\". \nWhat I'm looking for is a solution that can handle \"intellisense\" with php, ssh browsing like WinScp and snapping windows over halv the screen like Windows 7.\nI've found one solution for the last point, but it had a lot of bugs so it got disabled. For some reason I find Eclipse to be a bit slow on my mac, and I haven't found a nice way of integrating a browser for the remote server via ssh either. \nI'm making this community wiki since I'm really looking forward to seeing how everyone sets their environment up. I'm sure there are some gems to be found.\nOn my mac I mainly do PHP, mySQL, javaScript development. \n\nA: I have about 7 years of experience coding in a Windows environment before I got my first mac early this year.  So I know exactly what you're talking about.  I was very used to the combination of Visual Studio for c++ and .net, Notepad++ for .bat and other scripting and lightweight tasks, and the occasional bit of Eclipse for java.\nWhen I first started using my Mac, I was frustrated by what I saw to be a lack of equivalent software for OS X.  I tried different IDEs and text editing solutions (Eclipse, Aptana, Textmate, Smultron, Fraise, etc), but like you said, nothing really 'clicked'.\nHowever, at some point I stopped looking for replacements and started using the tools that were commonly used on *nix machines.  Particularly vim.  I've found that once my expectation of finding software equivalents to everything I had used on Windows dropped away, my horizons broadened.  I feel like my interest in coding has been renewed because I'm learning a completely different way to work and think about the process.  I'm using the command line way more than I ever have in the past, and this has translated into new techniques even in my Windows development (like using powershell and command line versions of tools rather than the gui).\nI was in a huge programming rut before I started using my mac, but I'm finding that being forced to look at my process and tools in a different way is really bringing out talents and interests I didn't know I had before.  I'm coding in python and c++ rather than javascript and c#, in one of the oldest editors in existence, and I'm loving it.\n\nA: I my self use variant of IDE for coding:\nWhen I did PHP I mainly use Zend Studio that was eclipse based.\nBeside that I use Eclipse itself (but I hadn't your problem about it's speed), or use NetBeans (it was really good).\nAnd some times use Vim or MacVim.\n\nA: I've found TextMate with a PHP completion bundle and an ftp+ssh bundle to be pretty solid. You get everything you're asking for except for the window management, and as @mankoff noted, there are lots of choices for that. Not listed by him is HyperDock, which handles both window-snapping and window previews from the dock.\n\nA: Jetbrains PHP Storm\n\nA: If Vim is being given as a solution - I think Aquamacs should also be considered. It is a version of Emacs configured to be more OS X like. (Note the usual vi/Emacs arguments)\nEmacs includes several modes supporting programming. \nEmacs does not have the vi split between inserting text and text manipulation whch might be a point in Aquamacs' favour if that is the reason you use nano.\n\nA: For window arranging:\n\n\n*\n\n*SizeUp http://irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/\n\n*Divvy http://mizage.com/divvy/\n\n*Breeze http://www.autumnapps.com/breeze/\n\n*ShiftIt http://code.google.com/p/shiftit/\n\n*Mercury Mover http://www.heliumfoot.com/mercurymover/details\n\n*Optimal Layout http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout/\n\n*Cinch http://irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/\n\nA: I've been using a combination of Eclipse and TextMate. TextMate grew on me quickly, especially since I'd come from the premise of finding a free editor, it was just very neat. I use VI for quick command line edits.\nTextMate has nice SCM integration, snippet based completion, great highlighting and folding. It also has plenty of helper scripts, and a really good system for customizing or adding languages. However, it lacks if you want to browse a codebase - no indexing. It is for that kind fo indexing and heavyweight autocompletion that I switch to Eclipse. TextMate is fast and light, in a similar way to Np++ on windows. Extending textmate can be done with simple scripts - ruby, shell and others.\nEclipse you already know - just download and unzip. Heavy, a little slow, but great for source browsing. \nWith the SSHFS suggestion from mankoff, take a look at macfusion - handy setup for fuse file systems.\n\nA: I'll recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacVim - it's a great editor, extremely powerful, and uses all the same plugins and config files on MacOS as it would on a PC or Linux. This is my main editor at work and I do about 50% of my coding at home with it.\n\n*TextMate - MacOS only though there are some clones for Windows now. Very flexible and powerful too, but not the fastest or most powerful when doing search/replace. It is very easy to set up snippets and tab-completion. I recommend watching the videos to see what it can do. It's commercial and hasn't seen any enhancements for a while but it's solid. When I'm experimenting or answering questions for Ruby code on StackOverflow I'm using TextMate.\n\n*Komodo Edit - Pretty useful. I don't use it as much as the other two but some people swear by it or it's big brother Komodo.\n\n*BBEdit - BB and I go way back, to before it was released as a commercial product. It is very fast when searching/replacing in multiple files - amazingly fast. The developers know the Mac really well and, in my opinion, have a lot more powerful editor than TextMate or Komodo Edit. When I have to munge or search a bunch of files it's my first choice. BBEdit's smaller sibling is TextWrangler, which is free and quite fast and nicely featured also.\n\n*Coda - a great web development editor, and my first choice when I'm going to be doing a lot of HTML because of its web-page preview integration and CSS editing.\n\n\nAlso, if you do a lot of CSS then check out CSSEdit. That's all it does, but it does it really well.\n\nA: For SSH browsing, you could use sshfs to mount the drive locally, and then use the Finder, or whatever local browser you want.\n\nA: Personally, I use a combination of NetBeans PHP Edition and Coda for my PHP / JavaScript development. I use NetBeans when I'm working on a full project locally, and when I commit to subversion that uploads to our testing server. I use Coda for editing files via SFTP as well as for quick PHP or JavaScript edits. I also use Transmit on occasion when I need to browse an SFTP / FTP site.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5057", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}

On OS X, /bin/bash is the default, so try editing .bashrc or .bash_profile instead.\n\nA: All you have to do to change this is open Terminal.app, and enter the following: \n\ndefaults write com.apple.versioner.python Version 3.1\n\nThis will change the default used in the terminal.

{"text": "Q: Concatenate two videos recorded with Snapz Pro I've recorded two videos with Snapz Pro, and I'd like to concatenate them (i.e., have one immediately follow the other in a single file). What's the easiest way to do that? I have iMovie '08 installed, and I can use it to combine the two into a single movie. However, I can't get it to export the resulting video at the same resolution as the original video.\nAccording to the QuickTime player inspector, the video formats of the two original videos are \"Apple Animation, 1164x1153, Millions IMA 4:1, Mono, 22.050 kHz', FPS: 9.97 fps.\n\nA: Becuase Apple Animation is an older QuickTime format, you should give QuickTime Player 7 a try, which has basic editing capabilities. If you're on Snow Leopard, it may not be installed, but you can fix that pretty quickly\nIf you need more than what QuickTime Player provides, it might be worth looking at QuickTime Pro.\n\nA: If you have QuickTime 7 Pro, this is as easy as copy and paste.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open both videos in QuickTime\n\n*Select and copy the contents of one video\n(\u2318+A,\n\u2318+C)\n\n*Switch to the other video and move the playhead to the desired insertion point (e.g. the beginning or end) and paste (\u2318+V)\n\n\nThen you can save the combined movie.\nOf course, it is likely you don't already have QuickTime 7 Pro already installed. Apple charge extra for QuickTime Pro (\u00a320) which may not be worthwhile for you if you don't use it much. Also, if you are using Snow Leopard, that includes QuickTime X which doesn't have a Pro version available. In that case you'd need to install QuickTime 7 in addition to QuickTime X.\nI imagine there has to be a way to do it with iMovie as well, but I don't have experience with that.

{"text": "Q: How do I get Windows to assign a drive letter to my iPhone? I want to be able to move photos and videos from my iPhone onto my Windows PC, but the iPhone doesn't present itself like a compact camera. Because my existing import process works so well with normal compact cameras (they have drive letters!), I don't want to have to mess around with extra programs.\nWhen I connect my iPhone, I don't get a new drive letter for it. Instead of e.g. K:\\DCIM\\800AAAAA I just get the very cryptic address Computer\\Torbens iPhone 4\\Internal Storage\\DCIM\\800AAAAA. Windows Explorer can navigate this path, but no programs can access the path.\nHow do I get Windows to assign a drive letter to my iPhone?\nI am not interested in programs that can look into my iPhone and allow me to manually copy files from it to my harddisk. (iFunBox, DiskAid, Wifi photo transfer app, WinAmp - as mentioned in this recent question)\nI want a drive letter! When I have that, I can continue to use my existing photo-importing applications that do everything with a single click! (Moving rather than copying, file renaming based on timestamp, etc.) \nIs there some hack app that will make the iPhone present itself with a drive letter? This would probably not be a Windows application but rather an iPhone jailbreak app, but any solution is welcome.\nI'm running Win7 and a jailbroken iOS 4.1. \n\nA: I get a drive letter just fine under XP. Under XP a dialog pops up each time I plug it in, asking how it should be handled. By canceling it ends up being handled as a drive.\nMy guess is that there's a setting, probably related to cameras and photos, that will change how Windows 7 handles it by default. Unfortunately I've no Win 7 machine handy.\n\nA couple of suggestions from Googling for answers:\n\n*\n\n*Many people have solved the problem by deleting any photos on their iPhone that weren't actually taken with the iPhone. Anything received in email, saved to disk in Safari, etc. After clearing those out the device again appeared as a drive.\n\n\n*Reinstall the iPhone driver in Windows 7 by following instructions from Apple Support.\n\n\nEDITED TO ADD WIN XP, AS REQUESTED\n\nGetting Windows XP to Present Itself as a Drive-Like Camera\nFirst, the way I have things set up, which may or may not affect how it works for you: I am running all of the XP service packs, updated regularly through Software Update, with no special drivers or applications. My account is an administrator on my PC. iTunes 10.1 is installed, though it is not involved with the camera stuff (it's possible that having iTunes installed does provide some kind of driver, I don't know). My iPhone is a stock iPhone 3GS, non-jailbroken, running iOS 4.2.1. Note that all of this worked identically with iTunes 9 and my phone running iOS 3.0.1.\nEvent Handling\nThe first time you attach your iPhone to your WinXP PC a dialog much like the following should appear:\n\nDrive List\nIf you choose one of the Microsoft Office handlers, the Wizard, or another app like Photoshop, your phone  will not present itself as a camera (more on changing that behavior below). If you click Cancel then the dialog will disappear and the camera will become available.\n\nWindows Explorer Media Directory\nIf you then double-click on the iPhone icon all of the images and movies are presented:\n\nYou can freely drag photos and videos out of the directory. You can drag stuff in, too.\nChanging the Event Handler\nIf at some point you chose an event handler rather than clicking Cancel you can change how XP handles the iPhone. You'll need to get to the phone's Properties, which may require opening the Scanners and Cameras control panel. Click on the dialog's Events tab to see this:\n\nIf you change your current setting to Prompt then you'll get that first dialog I showed when you plug in your device. You can also choose Take no action if you want it to always behave like a drive.\n\nA: I've successfully mapped a drive letter to the iPad on Win7 64 machine. Just install the Air Sharing app on the iPad and map using the Bonjour address.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5096", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}

Is there any clean way in AppleScript to check to see if the backup process is completed? Or is there a good \"hook\" that you can use in bash to check to see if it's completed?\n\nA: You might also start the backup with tmutil startbackup -b. -b blocks the command until the backup has finished.\n\nA: Here's one way - I know it's nowhere near a \"proper\" solution, but I imagine it would work.\nps ax | grep \"/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/backupd-helper\" | grep -v 'grep'\nWhat it does is search the process list for the backupd-helper process, then filters out the grep command itself from showing up.

Before that you can use, as mentioned, /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/backupd-helper to manually run Time Machine.\nYou can then use wait to wait until the process is finished. Without arguments it will simply wait; if you provide the PID you can get its return value (exit status).\nParticularly, wait $! will wait for the last process started in that shell. However, as Lauri mentioned, this wait will return before time machine is finished because backupd-helper finishes before the backup is done. I was not able to find any process name that indicated that the backup was not complete.\nLooking at the contents of /var/logs/system.log (or via the Console), I noticed that when the backup is finished, the last thing that is done is to eject the time machine disk image. Sure enough I checked that (this is OS X 10.6.8) during the backup there is a /Volumes/Time Machine Backups. Thus you can simply check if the directory exists. When it no longer does, Time Machine is finished.\nI am not sure if this will work for everyone since I've followed the directions here to backup to a Windows machine on the network.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5105", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "17"}}

I was wondering if the MBA OCT 2010 edition with max cpu (2.13GHz Intel Core 2 Duo) and 4gb ram would work well with photoshop and some web development? The tools I use are photoshop, dreamweaver, textmate,coda, and transmit, also my MBP from 2008 is 4gb intel core 2 duo 2.4 ghz. Would the MBA be faster then my 2008 MBP? \n\nA: A similar question was asked over at Programmers.SE, though it was about iOS development. Some might say that's not the same thing, but Photoshop is a robust application that allows you to install some very heavy-duty plug-ins and it has some of its own as well. The consensus could be gotten from the top two answers (mine, which has the higher vote count, and the other which was accepted):\nMine with 5 votes:\n\n...leaving aside price, I would\n  recommend a MacBook Pro for any\n  serious development work instead. A\n  MacBook Pro is more easily upgradeable\n  to suit needs than an Air (if it is\n  even upgradeable at all). The Air\n  seems more targeted to lighter-weight\n  uses.\n\nAccepted with 4 votes:\n\nIt's obviously not going to be the\n  fastest machine but it's perfectly\n  suitable.\nI'd say the 13\" over the 11\" because\n  reasonable screen size is a big deal\n  for development, and it can go up to\n  4Gb RAM rather than 2Gb (absolutely go\n  for the 4Gb RAM model on day one and\n  if you can afford it the faster\n  processor as I suspect upgrading later\n  isn't something Apple will be\n  pushing).\nYes it's got limitations (basically\n  the same as any laptop - essentially\n  screen and power are limited next to a\n  desktop) but I have the new one and\n  it's entirely workable and I know\n  others who use them (and used the old\n  MacBook Air) day to day with no\n  problems.\n\nI, personally, still wouldn't recommend the MBA for any type of development work, web or otherwise. I've yet to do anything developing for iOS that causes me to bog down my machine the way Photoshop can and will.\n\nA: I use a Oct 2010 Air for development work, that includes working in Coda on RoR sites, light Photoshop, XCode iOS development and C++ work in QtCreator. This is frequently with Ubuntu running in VBox at the same time. \nIt works, it's not going to be so fast your eyes fall out. I've never seen mine get bogged down at all, it stays perfectly solid unless I'm really really pushing it and that's incredibly rare. Plus, you know, 8 hours battery life, I'll take portable and long life over the extra weight and more power.\n(As a side note I opened 50 3.5Mb PSDs in about 30 seconds without the system stuttering, so that might have an indication of the relative speed)\n\nA: As a web developer who uses a Mac Pro and sits next to another dev who uses just a 13\" MBA (MC504LL/A (256 GB)), for web development (especially if you're starting and stopping a server often) the Air often \"feels\" faster than much more powerful machines, though to be fair, on the Mac Pro (with a single 2TB 7200rpm drive), I have 9GB of ram, and tend to leave more things running/open as a result. This is almost entirely the SSD's doing. So putting an SSD in the 13\" MBP would be a big help to overcome that.\nSo from my experience it works well for web development and some Photoshoping, which is more what I do.\nI'm looking to replace a 2006 Macbook I still use for freelance work, but Apple really made it a tough by keeping the lower-res screen in the 13\" MBP, that's the only thing that's making the Air look more attractive at this point.\nEdit: After seeing this video I decided to go with the Air (Thunderbolt) MBA (Oct 2010) + Photoshop video\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5129", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

The 5th and 6th gen iPods would not produce an audio out signal using the connector.\nWhat I determined is that pin 11 on the dock connector is used to enable audio out on the dock connector if pin 11 is grounded. I took a my dock connector apart and pin 11 was not connected. Determining which pin 11 is was difficult as the connector is quite small. After soldering a jumper between pin 11 and ground my 5th and 6th gen iPods can once again be used with the headphone amplifier.\nIt seem the the 5th and 6th gens check for the pin 11 being at ground before audio comes out of the dock connector, where as the older generations sent audio to the dock regardless. I bought the connector online \u2014 I went to the Apple store but they do not have a connector like that, otherwise I would have bought one of theirs.\n\nA: I just got the iPod Nano 6th generation, and was able to plug it into my Altec Lansing IMT325 via dock connector without any problems.\nSo, I think the 6th generation iPod dock connector is not different from the 5th generation at all.\n(The Altec Lansing IMT325 says on the box that it works with iPod Nano 3rd to 5th generation, which led to my original question.)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5134", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}
{"text": "Q: Can I configure the modem on my G5 to only allow calls from certain numbers to ring through? This is a weird question, I know, but... I have an alarm system which I can call into and send commands to, I.E. to arm/disarm/listen to the ambient noise. However, for this to work obviously it has to pick up the line, which prevents me from using voicemail for anyone who calls me.\nInstead of getting a separate phone line, I was wondering, if I plug my G5 into the phone line and plug this device's telephone line in to the telephone line out of my G5, is there any way the G5 could only tell the alarm system the phone is ringing for certain caller ID numbers?\n\nA: I can think of a variety of methods to do what you want, but none of them are easy solutions. You'll probably need to write some code. This question should be tagged PBX, but that is too obscure for this site.\nYou'll probably want minicom installed to control the G5 modem. Get it via fink or macports. If you can use minicom to check the number without answering, then you are mostly done. If it doesn't match, ignore it. If it does match, you'll need to find some way for minicom to answer/forward/pass the incoming call out the modem out line. I'm not yet sure how to do this.\nIf minicom needs to answer the call in order to determine where it came from, then the situation is as above, but you might need two modems. If it is a call for the security center, pass it out one modem. If it isn't, pass it out the other, which goes to your home phone I presume.\nIf minicom cannot determine the number, or if can but has to answer in order to check it and this is problematic, then I would get a caller ID display, put it in next to the G5, and use a webcam to read the numbers off the caller ID. OpenCV would help with this part, or any script-able optical character recognition (OCR) software. You can get gocr from fink or macports too, and that might be sufficient. Determine the number and if it should go to the security console, have minicom patch it through.\nBut, why do you need to call in?\nIf your G5 is at home and online, it might be easier to not call into the security system, but SMS or email yourself, have the G5 fetching the mail, and taking action based on that (perhaps that action is using minicom to connect to the security system, but you don't need a phone line to the outside world in this case).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5135", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

I was excited when my new HP 8500A arrived this weekend because I wanted to try out its recently added AirPrint compatibility.

What is not clear on HP's AirPrint website is how one goes about updating the firmware. Playing with the menus on the printer I finally found that attempting to access the web apps menu causes the printer to check if it has the latest firmware. The printer then determined that it did not and proceeded to download and install the firmware update. After the update the iPad lists the printer as an option for printing. My programmer brain was probably making this too hard looking for a non-consumer friendly way of doing the update.

{"text": "Q: What's the best NAS for home usage with Macs? Please share your experiences and reviews about NAS (Network-Attached Storage) below. In particular, rate their compatibility with Macs, OS X, iTunes, Time Machine, AppleTV, and other Apple-specific tools. The goal is for future users to be able to easily find the best Mac-compatible NAS appliance.\nRules:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a single answer for each NAS (no duplicates, please).\n\n*Vote (up or down) on any NAS you have experience with.\n\n\nAlso welcome: useful reference links, such as this one from xlr8yourmac.com.\n\nA: Drobo FS\nThe Drobo FS is my new favourite NAS. I've run a Netgear ReadyNAS and a PC-based NAS in the past and neither touch the Drobo FS for simplicity, speed and reliability. The ReadyNAS suffered from poor RAID performance, especially on reboots when volumes needed to be scanned. And the power supply in it was really lame. And the PC-based NAS was just a pain to maintain and costly to keep up.\nThe Drobo FS is super simple to set up. Has very, very good volume build and scanning speeds on startup. Has what has to be the best hot-swapping of any multi-disk unit I've ever seen that was in the sub-$10k range. And performs like a champ while drawing very little power.\nI now run an FS for home sharing and an old Drobo hangs off my iMac for audio project data. They are teh awesome.\n\nA: Time Capsule\nThe Time Capsule can be used as a shared drive.\nIt is also a Wi-Fi router, and is automatically recognized as a backup device for Time Machine.\n\nA: Freenas using generic hardware\nI love the ability to grab an old computer, fill it full of cheap hard drives, and install Freenas on a CF card or USB drive. Software RAID is reliable. \nA key point, if any of the hardware dies, the RAID array can be rebuilt when the software is installed on new hardware, unlike some proprietary solutions (NAS or RAID cards) where you may be tied to a particular vendor and/or model, which, after time, may not be sold/available.\nWorks fine with Macs and PCs -- and for this reason i use SMB shares rather than AFP. Performance is fine.\nI use the SMB shares to stream to all the computers in the house, and there is no problem.\nTime Machine backups are a little more complex, involving creating a Sparse Bundle (which is not the official method). For this reason, i don't do this, i use Carbon Copy Cloner to run to a disk image (dmg) every night.\nI use MediaRover to sync iTunes libraries, and this works fine. Other iTunes support is available (an iTunes/DAAP server called Firefly), but i haven't used it.\nIt has a BitTorrent server built in, but again, i haven't used it.\nAdministration is very easy (web based), setup is not difficult, but there are several steps to add disks, format them, create a RAID array, create a mount point, enable the services (AFP or SMB) to access. Documentation and community support are satisfactory.\n\nA: Don't want start any flamewar, but today here is only NAS solution - the ZFS based NAS.\nZFS is a filesystem, what has \"copy on write\" feature, so you will get a backup in every save - fully transparently. ZFS has million really cool features like raid management, snapshots etc.. too much for one post. If you interested can duckduck for ZFS.\nZFS is implemented in Solaris and in the FreeBSD. So, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*use some older (but 64bit+lots of RAM) PC with a plenty of HDDs and\n\n*\n\n*download and install FreeNAS. You will get web-managed NAS with Samba and etc.\n\n*install plain FreeBSD and config it as NAS plus some your own tweaking - IMHO this is the best way.\n\n\n*you can also buy an preconfigured FreeBSD/ZFS NAS too\n\n\nYou should definitely check theese:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://breden.org.uk/2008/03/02/home-fileserver-i\u2019ll-use-zfs/\n\n*http://blogs.oracle.com/constantin/entry/zfs_and_mac_os_x\n\nA: Western Digital MyBook World Edition\nYesterday I installed a Western Digital MyBook World Edition, 1 TeraByte, single disk.\nPros: very simple to install and work with, includes a Media Server and a iTunes server that can be used to share music and videos across the network. It's pre configured with the common shares and if you copy the files in the proper folders it's very, very simple to use. Quite cheap compared to a similar solution from QNap or Sinology. I did not perform any single task \"mac related\" on it and it worked from start with my Mac.\nCons: old firmware from 2009 and no update available, the single 1 TB disk inside obviously do not support any kind of Raid, no serviceable by changing disk if needed (unless you broke your warranty), the control panel do not give you a lot of control also if you use the so called advanced version.\nDefinitively a good choice for a \"first\" NAS to work and experience with, if you need to go on a cheap model or if you do not have a lot of IT experience, suggested for simple home environment where no redundancy it's needed, I would avoid it if you need redundancy or if you like to fine tune and experiment with every possible option.\nThere is also a public wiki about hacking it but I've not tested any of the stuff described (yet!).\nUPDATE: after some time I've found more problems, all related to the time machine interface:\n1) The quota option do not work with time machine\n2) The Lion update completely stopped the Time Machine usage\nNOT RECOMMENDED ANYMORE!!!!\nUPDATE: The Lion/Time Machine problem will hopefully be fixed soon. Apple changed some things and Western Digital is working on an update. This affects the MyBook Live and MyBook World Edition II. Read more: Error: 'The network backup disk does not support the required AFP features' is displayed using Time Machine on Mac OSX 10.7.x (Lion) to backup to a WD NAS drive\n\nA: Netgear ReadyNAS\nWe recently joined the crowd getting their first NAS, and after taking a close look at several, settled on the Netgear ReadyNAS NV+.\nThe Drobo, previously mentioned, was tempting\u2014but just way too expensive for use on a home network.\nWe've only had it a month or two, but so far, so good. Like most Netgear products, it works well with Macs. There's also a solid community & support site.\n\nA: Western Digital My Book Live\n\n\n*\n\n*Small footprint (same size as MyBook desktop drives)\n\n*Size 1-3 Tb\n\n*Pretty cheap\n\n*TimeMachine compatible over network (firmware just got updated with support for Lion)\n\n*Single disk, no RAID\n\n\nhttp://wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=280\n\nA: Qnap 259PRO+\nThe Qnap TS259Pro+ which uses a 1.8Ghz Dual Core Atom CPU,\nwould be the perfect setup for Sickbeard, and streaming to more than one TV in the house. Take the firmware for a spin with this \"Live Demo\"\n\nA: Seagate Blackarmor NAS220\nAt the moment of buying, the features listed sounded great, and Mac compatible.\nOnce in the studio, and after 4 weeks, it is just a hard drive on the network.\nThese are some of the issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*NOT Time Machine compatible\n\n*Very slow\n\n*Access remotely is useless, hangs everytime. So you cannot access it outside the studio. This was a main reason for buying, and tech support say they know about the issue and are to update... still waiting for it.\n\n*Software for mac is just a discovery tool. The name says it all, it tries to find the NAS, which it initially did, now it no longer detects it. Finder does.\n\n*Only a APC brand UPS is compatible. This was a total surprise, it is only stated in small letters in the manual inside the box, not outside or anywhere else visible before you buy, not even the product web page.\n\n*Very slow, i know i already said that, but it is terribly slow.\n\n\nStay away, not only mac users, but everybody who wants a NAS, this is not an option.\n\nA: Synology DiskStation\nThe Synology DSM software has built-in support for Macs including Apple Fileshare Protocol (afp) and Time Machine support. It has an iTunes server in addition to a regular DLNA Media server. As it is Linux based it is easy to configure the NAS to do rsync backups (ssh login).\nIt has a great web-based desktop-style interface that is very easy to understand and use. The DSM software is constantly being updated and improved.\nThey have solutions from 2-disk on up to 15-disk.  You can find the 4-disk DS411j without drives for less than $400.\n\nA: A Mac\nMy NAS of choice is an old Mac. In my case, I had an old MacBook that wouldn't hold a charge anymore so I rigged up an eSATA connection to my 2TB external drive.\nThe advantages to using an actual Mac over a true NAS system:\n\n*\n\n*Uses first-party AFP on HFS for optimal compatibility. In particular, it supports Spotlight and fast file searches (CatSearch), something that other NAS systems cannot do as well: They usually use a Linux system with netatalk and an ext3 file system which, compared to AFP with HFS, are not optimized for the ways a Mac can search. For more technical information on this, see the Find Any File FAQ, What kind of disks do support \"fast search\"?\nFurther features to consider:\n\n*\n\n*Can serve as a Time Machine backup volume (some other NAS can do that as well).\n\n*Works great as an iTunes master library, connected to my Apple TV and my other Macs via Home Sharing.\n\n*Can run a BitTorrent client to download Linux ISOs and Stack Overflow data dumps (some other NAS can do that as well).\n\n*Use built-in screen sharing to control.\n\n\nA: D-Link DNS-323\nThe D-Link DNS-323 is quite customizable, but should do everything you need out of the box.\nIt has a very active community behind it\n\nA: QNAP is surprisingly perfect actually ;o)\nI use TS-419 for my home use and pretty happy with it.\n\nA: WD My Cloud EX2 12 TB: Pre-configured Network Attached Storage featuring WD Red Drives: $662.5 or $56/TB\nI put together a comparison here: http://forum.railsonmaui.com/t/best-way-to-backup-large-external-hard-drives/305.\nBased on reading many of the numerous reviews, the WD gets the job done at a very competitive price point with few disadvantages.\nI'm ordering one this week and will plan to update my answer.

Unfortunately my DVD drive is toast, so I can't boot from the install DVD and make the repair.  Is there a way I can create a bootable USB drive and perform the repair that way.  I have an 8Gb USB drive.\n\nA: In order to create a bootable drive, you need the install DVD (or a copy of it) mounted. Sorry\u2026\nDo you have a friend with a Mac? If so, you could take the thumb drive & install DVD there and create a boot drive for yourself.\n\nA: This may not be the solution you want, but you could boot into single-user mode to run a diagnostic on your boot drive.\nTo do this you hold down Command+s when turning the computer on.

If I have a bunch of menu extras (the things on the top right side of the menu bar, such as time, date, battery status, and other OS X icons, plus 3rd party icons from QuickSilver, DropBox, etc.), sometimes they are hidden if the foreground application has a lot of or long-named menu items.\nIs there a way that I can access the menu extras that are not displayed because the menu items get priority?

{"text": "Q: Switching between applications in OS X It is very easy to switch applications in OS X using \u2318-tab. But what if an application is hidden?\nLet me describe some problems I am facing and what I want to accomplish.\n\n\n*\n\n*\u2318-tab switches between all opened applications\nWhat about minimized applications or applications with no windows?\n(Xcode, for example, after I've closed all its open windows)\n\n*When I press F9, I can see all windows\nThis includes minimized windows at the bottom, but not hidden windows\n\n*Hidden versus minimized windows and application creates confusion\n\n*If someone wants to switch, they can:\n\n\n*\n\n*F11 to view the desktop\n\n*F9 to view all opened windows (except for hidden windows)\n\n*F8 to switch Spaces (if multiple Spaces are active)\n\n*\u2318-tab for all applications\n\n*\u2318-H to hide an application\n\n*\u2318-M to minimize a window\n\n*\u2318-` to switch between multiple windows of one application\n\n\n\nI face a lot of confusion while switching. I have to keep many things in mind, such as whether it is a window or an application.\nIn short: What do you do when you want to switch? And what's the simplest way to get familiar with how OS X handles opened windows and applications?\n\nA: Let\u2019s reply in parts (as Jack The Ripper may say).\n\n\n*\n\n*\u2318 cmd + Tab is effectively for switching between applications but not windows of an application.\n\n*\u2318 cmd + ` does the window part. \n\n\nSo far, so good. \nWhy do we have Minimize and Hide?\nAt first they tend to be very confusing, especially because the hide part is rather new to people coming from other Operating Systems. Windows only has minimize. \nIt is confusing but the reason for both becomes apparent when you analyze the limitations of each. Independently of the particular implementation that OS X does for handling with this situations, there\u2019s a reason for each. \nHide\n\u2318 cmd + H will effectively hide most of the applications (and I say most because there are some notable exceptions out there). You will want to hide an application when you want to get it out of the way, completely, in all its forms, windows, and palettes. There will be two traces of the application after it has been hidden. It will be on the Dock with a dot (where you can click to perform the usual dock\u2019s magic) and it will be once in \u2318 cmd + Tab regardless of the number of windows/palettes/etc.\nSo in conclusion, hide is an all-or-nothing mode. If you have a multi-document application (e.g.: Pages) with a few documents open (each in its own window), and you want to not see all of them at the same time, Hide is the way to go. It disappears. Until you bring it back, again, all of it. It also doesn\u2019t show in Expos\u00e9, so you can\u2019t find it there. You\u2019ve hidden it. \nMinimize\n\u2318 cmd + M will perform an old trick and will send the current window to the dock. In older OS X versions, there was a dedicated space (next to the trashcan) for these minimized windows. Snow Leopard changed (for better in my opinion) the way this works, and now you can see them in Expos\u00e9 or when clicking (and holding) on the application icon in the Dock. This subtle distinction is the first important difference, as hidden apps are invisible to Expos\u00e9 (except when you click on the Dock\u2019s Icon, expos\u00e9 will show all the windows, separating the minimized ones in the lower portion, but you can still see the ones that were open before you hide the whole application).\nYou want to use Minimize when \u2014following the above example with Pages\u2014 you have this Application with three windows (Pages Docs) and you want to hide one of the documents, but not all of them. Minimize it, and it will go to the Dock, but you can still work on the other documents you have open. \nBut what about Applications with one Window?\nWell, here\u2019s where things get \u201cgray\u201d. Technically, unless you really like Minimize (or have any other reason), hide should be the way to get rid of that Application. Minimize is more clumsy and harder to bring back without the mouse, but hidden windows do not show up in Expos\u00e9, so you really have to decide.\nOk, I know I minimized something, how do I bring it back without the mouse?\nThat\u2019s a tricky one since the age of Panther (OS X 10.3). Perform this simple test. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit and create 3 new documents (windows). You have now 3 editor screens right in front of you. \n\n*\u2318 cmd + M one of them, and watch it go to the Dock. \n\n*Now use \u2318 cmd + ` and see you can only switch between the two windows.\n\n*\u2318 cmd + H in either Window, hides all the TextEdit windows. It no longer shows in Expos\u00e9\u2026 wait\u2026 the Minimized windows do show! \n\n\nLet\u2019s get real\u2026 really, how do I bring it back?!\nTechnique Number One:\nUse Expos\u00e9. You can type the name of the window while expose is activated (or use the arrow keys) to select a window, including the minimized ones.\nTechnique Number Two: (this one is trickier)\n\u2318 cmd + Tab until you have TextEdit selected but don\u2019t release \u2318 cmd, instead press \u2325 alt (both at the same time now) and release them together. It\u2019s hard. \nNow this doesn\u2019t always work (especially if the Application has multiple windows open and you have switched a few times away), so the best way to bring minimized apps back is Expose.\nEnough trickery, how do we deal with this?\nThis is subjective and a matter of personal preference, and I didn\u2019t even include Spaces in the mix, that would have make it more interesting\u2026 all these window handling mechanisms are confusing and have gotten more confusing with the newest additions to OS X. But it\u2019s usable and you get used to it kind of fast. \nWhat I do is usually hide an application I don\u2019t use. I don\u2019t really use Spaces, I hide. If I happen to have a lot of windows of an application open, I start to minimize the ones that I really wish I could hide but I can\u2019t because then I\u2019ll lose the others (are you following me here?). So the key for me is Hide as much as possible. Only minimize when more than one Window within the same application and I want to keep at least one visible. \nI have recently started using HyperDock (still Beta and Free) and I like the Window 7 approach to the Dock (and the fact that It can show all safari tabs as \u201cwindows\u201d). So I\u2019ll be likely getting that. I don\u2019t use the Mouse that much, but that\u2019s a nice addition for when I do. \nIn Mac, users tend to hide rather than Minimize, at least that\u2019s my experience after spending years with other Mac users (mostly programmers and graphic designers). \nAs they say in Internet, ymmv. :)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5201", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

I need to mount an SSH/SFTP volume and make it visible in finder to be able to use it as if it were a local volume (think SMB share). I have tried everything I could find (MacFUSE + sshfs (whatever version), Macfusion (couldn't install),...).\nIs there anyway to do this seemingly simple thing? It feels like I'm missing something here. Also, I'm not looking for an SFTP client for download/upload. My personal machine is an Ubuntu box, and that's easily doable on that.\n\nA: As of March 2013, the current free software solution is macFUSE plus a package for SSHFS (a download link on Fuse for OS X webpage).\nMacfusion is a GUI for easy mounting/unmounting remote shares but it needs to be patched to work with SSHFS/Fuse for OS X.\n\nA: Well, MacFusion was going to be my answer but since you've tried that I'll recommend my second favourite app when it comes to mounting shares: Panic's Transmit. It's new, very awesome, feature lets you mount any share that it can connect to in the UI as a \"disk\" in your Finder that you can drag files to. SFTP, SSH, S3...very cool.\n\nA: The best solution I've found today (2017) is to use Homebrew and Cask to install osxfuse and sshfs. Note that Homebrew core deprecated all FUSE-related formulae in 2020 so you need to install sshfs from a tap:\nbrew install --cask macfuse\nbrew install gromgit/fuse/sshfs-mac\n\nAnd then:\nsshfs username@hostname:/remote/directory/path /local/mount/point -ovolname=NAME\n\nIt works! :-)\n\nA: I use Cyberduck for this task. It's a cross-platform (but native on mac) app that is full of features and it's free to use. You can support the developers by donating or buying it directly from the Mac App Store.\nThe developer also has an application named Mountainduck which let you mount the path you want to a folder and access it through Finder app.\n\nA: Best ones that you can use are Transmit, like has been said before, or Expandrive, which is probably more like what you're looking for, as finder integration is its main feature.\n\nA: Another solution is WebDrive (35$+). I successfully used the Windows version of the same product, so I expect the same from the OS X version. Too bad, that they require you to buy separate licenses for Windows and OS X.\n\nA: If you already have FUSE for OS X installed (e.g. you got it directly from SourceForge), then @eskatos solution can reduced to just installing sshfs instead of the whole cask which includes FUSE.  You can do this by using:  \nbrew install homebrew/fuse/sshfs\n\nYou might want to check if you have the latest version of FUSE for OS X through your System Preferences while you're at it.\n\nA: Given I cannot comment, I'll add to this answer that if you want to unmount the recently mounted sshfs disk, you need to execute:\numount <MOUNTPOINT>\n\nThe sshfs man page states that you should do fusermount -u <MOUNTPOINT> but that command doesn't exist in macOS\n\nA: Just in case you are having problems unmounting the disk, you can unmount it simply writing\numount ~/mounted/folder\n\nhope it saves some headache to someone else\n\nA: I use Filezilla, its free, connect as sftp.\n\nA: ExpanDrive is a commercial version with an outrageous $50 price tag, but is very clean and slick. \nIt also mounts Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Amazon S3, OwnCloud folders, plus a bunch more and supports ssh keys and sftp. \n\nA: You can download CloudMounter from the Mac App Store.\nThis app, permit virtual mount units like, GoogleDrive, DropBox, S3, SFTP, FTP, etc.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5209", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "126"}}

{"text": "Q: Using international phone numbers on iPhone edit: 1 accepted answer but still no (good) solution! :(\n\n\n*\n\n*In my previous phone carrier I could just dial +55 11 99883655 and it would just work.\n\n*Now I moved to a new carrier and it doesn't work anymore! When I dial the same international number it keeps saying the number isn't formatted correctly.\nHow can I get my iPhone to understand international numbering back again?\nI've got over 100 contacts with numbers stored in this format already, and I want to keep them that way.\nAt this point I would be happy with any simple app that would just enable me to use my stored info the way it is to strip the +5511 part and place a call. Or some tweaking to allow proper and simple editing of the phone number on Phone.app would be very welcomed!\n\nA: You are in Brazil (so am I), so you can't just dial the \"+\" in front of the country code. You need to dial \"00\" and the CSP (the long distance operator code).\nWhat happens is that some operators (Oi and Claro, for sure) have a JavaCard application in the SIM card that intercepts every call you place and before send the dialed number to the network verifies if you are in a situation that you should need to add a CSP or not, and adds the operators own CSP in that case, if there isn't one in the dialed number.\nSo, for example, if I'm in Rio (area code 21) and dial a call to (24) 9999-8888, which is a long distance call, the application will add \"0\"+  to my number. The same if I'm in Petr\u00f3polis (area code 24), since my MSISDN is from Rio.\nOn the other side, if I register my phone numbers using the international notation, the application is smart enough to remove the \"+\" and the country code and add the \"0\" and the CSP, unless it realizes that you're roaming abroad.\nBesides Oi and Claro, I would guess that Vivo also uses an application like that, since it buys SIM cards from the same manufacturers. \nTIM has a different application in their SIM cards that modifies the phone numbers in your SIM card to add the CSP 41. It is a lame solution and I regret every time I have to use a TIM mobile.\nIf it is enough for you to have an application like TIM's, there are at least two in the brazilian App Store that will edit the iPhone's Address Book:\n\n\n*\n\n*[Minha Operadora](http://itunes.apple.com/br/app/minha-operadora/id401640256?mt=8)\n\n*[DDD F\u00e1cil](http://itunes.apple.com/br/app/ddd-facil/id381994693?mt=8)\n\n\nI haven't tested either, so I can't offer advice on how well they work.\nOtherwise, you will probably have to go back to an operator that offer that application in the SIM card (there is no way for a user to add apps to their SIM card by themselves).\n\nA: Usually adding two 0 at the beginning works.

{"text": "Q: How can I save Google Maps in iOS for offline use? Is there a way to retain a map with as much detail as possible (street view, maps, directions, zoom levels) offline? \nThis question refers to the Apple maps program that shipped with iOS versions 1 to 5 that relied on google map tiles. Please open a new question for iOS 6 maps and the google map app that is also available on the App Store since 2012.\n\nA: Without jailbreaking, the iPhone DOES cache the last few map tiles on the view, at all the view zoom levels. I'm not sure how extensive this is, and because it's only a temporary cache the data is always a second away from deletion. \nWithout jailbreaking, you can download an application, there are lots of them, but my favorite is called MotionX GPS, which is on the App Store. It allows you to cache and save certain types of map tiles from a variety of map modes, including Terrain, roads, and more. I'm not sure if they're specifically Google Maps, but you can get some types of maps for sure.\nAfter jailbreaking, which is both legal and easy, you can find a couple of 3rd party utilities to help you download map tiles to the device, but most of them require you to view the tiles in the app itself, not in the Maps application. \n\nA: Yes there is, but to do it properly requires a jailbreak (legal, voids warranty) and a possible breaking of the Google Maps TOS.\nThe cache can be used to an extent: The Google Maps application uses its cache offline, so tiles are visible and the map can be panned a bit (if it was panned while online and could fetch neighboring tiles). Directions are retained in the list view even if you can't follow them all in map view.\nIf you want more than this, it isn't built in by default. If you jailbreak, you could hack it to have a much larger cache that supports hundreds of MB of content including zoom levels, etc.\nSetting it up would be a significant hack and against the Google Maps TOS. When online, you'd need to sniff your own packets off the iPhone, detect those involving Google Maps, and build a cache. When offline, you'll want to redirect all requests to Google Maps servers to a local HTTP server running on the iPhone, and then serve the tiles. \nI've seen this done with a computer that was frequently offline, but not with an iPhone, but it should work just fine. You can also add custom tile layers this way if you want.\n\nA: Another method does not involve as much hacking. It seems some people have already solved this problem. You do need to jailbreak, and directions will not work, but browsing at different zoom levels should work, and GPS works too, so you at least know where you are.\nSee the following sites:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://iphonenodata.com/site/offline-maps/\n\n*http://joesonic.com/blog/2008/04/14/google-maps-offline-for-iphone/\n\n*http://iphonefreakz.com/2008/04/12/save-google-maps-with-maps-offline-for-later-viewing/\n\nA: I use CityMaps2Go for offline maps.  Not quite the same as Google Maps, but pretty good for my use.  I live in a relatively low-population area, so there wasn't a map available for my area at first, but they added it within a few days of my requesting it.\n\nA: The application Atomic Web Browser can save a static copy of a Google Map page locally.  The saved page cannot be scrolled or zoomed, but it is available offline.  I tested with Airplane Mode on version 4.0.2.\n\nA: This may not satisfy all of the criteria, but there are a handful of humongous (in terms of file size) applications that have map data stored locally. Think traditional GPSes with screens that have to have this data stored locally.\nXROAD, Inc. has US West and US East apps that offer navigation features, and have map data stored in the application, so you may look them up offline, manually, or online with automatic triangulation. Note that these ARE NOT Google Maps. Per mankoff, Google's TOS prevents any other company from offering turn-by-turn on their map data (less current agreements with Apple and the like).\niTunes App Links:\nXROAD US West\nXROAD US East\nThere is very likely more if you look around, these are just the two that I've been shown before should I ever need to travel in a place with uncertain coverage.\n\nA: The iOS map app will cache tiles for as long as it can. In practice, my iPad will cache tiles for a turn by turn trip across the country and generally not lose any of the tiles when playing light games, reading books, etc... It's not foolproof, but the less you do with the device, the longer your tiles stay in memory. \nGoogle's tiles are not generally licensed for offline use. They do have an excellent static map API that might suit your needs but you'll have to find another app that allows more control over pre-loading map tiles for true offline use. The iOS map app simply doesn't do what you ask. \n\nA: I recommend OpenMaps - which uses OpenStreetMaps for map data. Simple to use, you can download the needed map area at any or all zoom levels.\n\nBrowse the maps of OpenStreetMap, download them for offline use, edit the maps (tag editing and node creation), find out where you are, search for addresses, get directions and scan the map for tweets with OpenMaps for iPhone, iPad an iPod touch.\n\n\nA: For offline maps, I use Offmaps, the old version. The map display is much faster than of City Maps 2Go, and my personal opinion is that it also feels much more like a iOS app should feel like. So even though Offmaps has no working compass, cost more money, can\u2019t download in the background and I had downloaded CityMaps for free, I stick with Offmaps.\n(Developer Felix Lamouroux has released a rather misleadingly-named new version some time ago, which is a different thing altogether \u2014 more a city guide with Points of Interest and maps.)\n\nA: I've installed on ipad galileo-offline-maps, and it keeps available previously opened maps when offline.\n\nA: As others have noted, you can't easily do it with Google Maps on a standard handset. What you can do is use another source of maps. There are a number of apps that use OpenStreetMap that allow you to download maps in advance. The one I used, oMaps, downloads data a different levels of detail so you can zoom in and out.\nThe maps are a little variable in quality but undoubtedly better than having no map at all.\n\nA: I use the GaiaGPS App for my walks. This is free and does the job. You can save maps and use them once you're on the spot without any connexions. And you can zoom! No need to say that this don't cover Street View, because of the size needed for this kind of feature.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5252", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "21"}}

I have it currently on my iPhone 4. It's untethered for last-gen devices, but for the iPhone 4 it's a tethered jailbreak, which means that you'll have to connect it to your computer and use the program (redsn0w) to turn on the phone every time the phone gets turned off or looses power. \nIf you don't turn off your phone a lot, then it's not big issue, though. And because you have a 3GS, you'll be untethered anyway.\nThe jailbreak is at http://blog.iphone-dev.org which is the iPhone Dev Team, the MOST reputable source for iPhone jailbreaking. These are the actual people who do the work (or compile it from Geohot). DO NOT trust any info from places like BigBoss, RedmondPie, UltraPWN, or anyone else.\n\nA: It is possible and it includes unlock.

Keywords are: USB and Apple Mobile Device (DFU Mode).\n\n*If the value after iBoot is 359.3 or lower, that's the old bootrom. Yippie!\nIf it's 359.3.2 or higher, tough luck you're stuck with new bootrom and lame tethered jailbreak.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5264", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

On iOS 7+ it is that simple.\n\nNow, if you want to automatically change it back (which is a completely different question), once you plug it out, you'll need to jailbreak. But since it's complicated and I haven't tried, I'll just give one pointer that seems to do it: get Tasker (found on lifehacker).\nI personally rather just manually switch it on and off, until apple decides to have some kind of NFC. It should be just around the corner, if not with NFC, then with iBeacon.\nOld answer (jailbreak only, iOS 4 or less)\nFirst, I just tried on my iphone and even calculator stays active after 1 minute, even if the screen dims out. So maybe your question is really just about keeping the screen on.\nAnyway, I can think of two solutions: kirikae with backgrounder might do the trick as a side effect. If not, you can use SBSettings with Autolock toggle to do it manually and temporarily set the auto-lock to never. All of them you should find in Cydia.\nedit: as none of the above actually worked, here's some update.\nSome custom toggles on SBSettings seem to just not work indeed. It's probably due to getting outdated or conflicting with something else, two common problems we find on cydia apps. BigBoss is kind of similar to SBSettings and also have an Autolock toggle. You could use it along with some multitasking, leave it on the background and use it as needed. It hardly have any conflicting issue.\nUnfortunately I can't find many more ideas to this.\nOnly thing I can assure you is that I just tried SBSettings's Autolock toggle on my iOS 3.1.3 and it works. It also says it's updated to 4, so most likely it's either problem with 4.1 or conflicting with something else you've got installed. And believe me, there are conflicts from the least expected things (look at the comments).\n\nA: I use iTunes.

Since dictionaries use entries like\n<key>some key</key>\n<string>some value</string>\n<key>another key with boolean value</key>\n<true />\n\nYou can create a valid XML file that is not a valid plist file, for example:\n<key>some key</key>\n<!-- oops, forgot to enter a value - still valid XML -->\n\n<!-- valid XML, not a plist -->\n<key>another key with boolean value</key>\n<true>yes</true>\n\nIf you're willing to go commercial, Plistinator will edit both binary and XML plist files.  \nFull-disclosure: I'm the author of Plistinator and the $12.99 it costs pays for my ramen and rent.\n\nA: Free Visual Studio Code editor can open, edit and save plist files in binary format with the help of the Binary Plist extension:\n\nA Visual Studio Code extension that enables editing of binary property list files as XML. It is inspired by the BinaryPlist Sublime Text package, although the experience is not as seamless (the user must agree to opening a binary file and the editing takes place in an additional tab). A virtual file system is used to achieve this using the FileSystemProvider API.\nThe extension is cross-platform but primarily uses the macOS plutil binary for conversion, the Python plistlib is used as an alterntative if available. The node package simple-plist is used as a fallback but due to JavaScript not having a float type real values that are whole numbers will be cast to integer types (a warning dialog is shown first).\n\n\nA: On a Terminal window, you can use PlistBuddy, available at /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy.\nPlistBuddy can read and modify values inside of a plist, either interactively or directly on the command line.\nHowever, PlistBuddy is not a GUI editor.\nUsage examples:\n# Show full help\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -h\n\n# Print content of plist\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c print /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist\n\n# Print selected content of plist\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'print SkipPaths' /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist\n\n\nA: A PList file, like Mankoff said, is just a specially formatted XML file, so you can actually edit and create them in a program like TextEdit.\nBecause of the specific nature of PLists to Development, however, using a special program like Xcode or Property List Editor becomes a much more fruitful endeavor. This is because it not only automatically formats the XML code for you, but it will actually translate the key identifiers and layers into readable words, and also for some values it will provide a drop-down menu to fill in the correct responses. Especially when dealing with iPhone plists, when multiple runtime variables can be set using the Plist, easily creating new fields and knowing what to put in them makes it so much easier.\nYou can get both Xcode and PList Editor from the Apple Developer website for free by downloading the latest Xcode release.\n\nA: I have used PlistEdit Pro for macOS and found it to be useful and comprehensively feature rich.\n\nA: BBEdit will open plist files for editing, and do any necessary conversion of file types.\nIt will also handle file permission access, if needed.\nYou can also do things like create Text Filters to do things like encode/decode base64 encoding.\nIt's the essential text editor for Mac.

{"text": "Q: What's the best iPhone SIP apps work internationally and allow recording? \n*\n\n*So far, Siphon is the best SIP app I've tried.\n\n*MobileVOIP and TruPhone are very nice too (and don't need jailbreaking). \n\n*Other apps offer at least some SIP features such as Nimbuzz, Fring, Viber and even Skype. \n\n*Apple's FaceTime audio clearly is an option for some\n\n\nWhile I have all of these, I hardly use any of them, for a variety of reasons.\nI'm looking for a more ideal third party app that should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Integrate with both Address Book and the iPhone's native recent calls\n\n*Replace phone.app and load rapidly to place phone calls\n\n*Have international number support  \n\n*Allow call recording\nAs a plus, \n- Support Skype, Google (talk, voice, etc) and integrate with other options if possible\n\nA: I've used Acrobits SoftPhone (link goes to their site, iTunes link below) for some time, thought admittedly very sparsely and only for the simplest of use cases, so, much of this is taken from their site.\nUse the OS' Address Book: Yep, it maintains it's own \"quick list\" (favorites) however.\nand global Recent Calls list: Nope, maintains it's own (pretty sure this one is impossible anyways, \"private APIs\" and all that).\nLoad as fast as Phone.app: I call this subjective, because Phone.app is always running, which gives it an inherit speedup compared to anything else. Acro's SoftPhone does support the VoIP backgrounding, and even push, so you can \"Swipe To Answer\", but it still takes at least a couple seconds to do. (At least that's how it feels, comparatively speaking.)\nInternational Number Support: I think this is not so much a client feature as much as it is a feature of your server you SIP register to. This one is unknown to me as I've never attempted to call an international (outside the US) number.\nAllow Recording: Yes. Upon tapping the record button, a voice announcement is played, and then conversation is recorded and able to be replayed from the app.\nSkype: Nope\nGoogle Voice: Yep, but to what extent, I am unsure. Per their website:\n\nGoogleVoice users:  Though we have integrated GoogleVoice, Acrobits Softphone's main use is as a SIP client.  You can setup Acrobits Softphone to initiate GoogleVoice calls through other types of numbers, but to get the full functionality of Acrobits Softphone, you need to have GoogleVoice linked to a SIP Account.\n\nRest: If it's SIP, it should work.\nBonus: It supports ZRTP. Zimmerman's encrypted RTP protocol for SIP calls. Free for incoming calls, in-app purchase for initiating calls using it.\niTunes Link: Acrobits Softphone.\n\nA: After some problems getting DTMF to work I tried WeePhone with some success.\n\nA: I just tried several free softphones and I liked Zoiper the best, but since our Asterisk server is configured with very peculiar prefix rules I cannot use it. It supports native address book integration, call recording, various audio and video codes... pretty cool, if only it would allow custom rewriting rules :(\nAs strong second best I decided to use Join softphone. It does integrate with addressbook and allows complex rewrite rules. It promises that it does call recordings, but I could not get it to work properly. What really puts me off with Join is rather confusing UI with too many colors and drop shadows. It really does not work well on mobile screen. Maybe desktop but not small screen such as mobile. But it was only feature full free solution I've found.\n\nA: I use Smartgroshen app, simple, good quality of voice and sync with your phone contacts. Get 0.5 euro at start.\n\nA: General problems when using Softphone app are:\n1. Complex network conditions in mobile networks (i.e. NAT). Not all VoIP servers can properly work with NAT.\n2. Limited bandwidth. Is is impossible to use high nitrate codecs in 3G networks. But many operators does not support modern codecs like Opus.\n3. Problems with incoming calls. To receive calls phone must be connected to the server. It drains battery.\nThis is not ad, but try our solution:\nwww.sipmobile.org\nWe resolved this issues. You can use our Softphone in mobile 3G networks with good voice quality. If you have LTE or WiFi, video calls are available. Softphone for iOS can be switched off and receive calls with push notifications (of course only in our domain).\n\nA: Prefer Sipgo. It's probably the app with the lowest bandwidth usage. No useless extras, just sip calls.\n\nA: I confirm Smartgroschen is good app for cheap international calls, voip calls with good quality voice calls.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5289", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "9"}}

The audio output works fine, but I am having issues with the audio input.\nI saw this post which talked about some power issues to the microphone on the Mac Mini\u2026 I did not quite get what they were discussing, though.\nI also found this link which says:\n\nSome microphones require power on the stereo mini jack and may not work on Mac systems. Try to check for Mac compatibility when buying USB microphone sets.

If yes, is there a workaround?\nDoes anyone know of any VERY cheap sound cards?\nWhy doesn't my microphone work?\n\nA: On new Macbook Pros, there is no microphone input. What you have is a line-level input. Microphones that do not have integrated power and amplification (all cheap computer microphones/handsets) will not work when connected to the line-level input.\nThe connectors are exactly the same, but on the line input there is stereo input and ground, and on the microphone input there is mono input, voltage reference and ground. The input level is also different, with line level at around 1V and microphone level at 10-100mV.\nTo resolve the problem, you need to get one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*a USB sound card which has a proper microphone input circuitry,\n\n*a powered, amplified microphone that can be used with line-level input, or \n\n*a microphone preamplifier.\n\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.hobby-hour.com/electronics/computer_microphone.php\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_level\n\nA: As discussed in the \"Are there headset adapters usable for MacBook Pros?\" thread, new Macs DO have a normal Mic level input.  However it is combined with the headphone jack (not the \"audio in\" port).  You can purchase an adapter (such as the \"Headset Buddy\") that combines the headphone and mic into a single \"smart-phone\" style plug.\nNote that this will only work properly under Mac OS.  So if you intend to use your headset under Windows with BootCamp, you will want a USB adapter, such as the Griffin iMic instead.\n\nA: As I wrote in an answer to this question, you can buy third-party USB adapters which should work (emphasis on the should), such as this USB 2.0 Virtual 7.1 Channel Sound Card Adapter.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5306", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}
{"text": "Q: How do I connect to a SOCKS Proxy from an iPhone/iPod Touch? I like to surf securely and privately via a SOCKS proxy which I created via SSH tunneling, on the Mac. I used the SSH client on my Mac to achieve this. Then I thought, since the iPhone OS is essentially Mac OS, the same trick might work also on the iPhone.\nI managed to create a SSh tunnel on my iPhone via the Terminal (iPhone's Terminal). (Yes, it's jail-broken)\nssh -D [port] user@domain.com\n\nAt this stage my iPhone is SOCKS proxy.\nHowever, there doesn't seem to be a way in the iPhone networking preference panel to specify a SOCKS proxy. Someone suggest creating a Proxy Auto-Contig (PAC) file to workaround this, but that sounds complicated.\nAny ideas how to make iPhone use it's own SOCKS proxy?\n\nA: Wow thanks for that last answer. \nTogether with this \"SSH to get your iPhone online via USB cable\" blog post, I came up with a pretty solid instant reverse SSH/SOCKS solution over USB tether given only an SSH server somewhere on your network. This allows all my tcp-based apps to use an SSH server's internet across USB despite my WiFi being defective and not having a strong phone data plan (T-Mobile Prepaid). \nNo proxy server configuration required.\nThe gist of the blog post is that you CAN control the proxy from the command line. Use the file:\n/private/var/preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist\nFind the \"ip1\" section (if you want to replace GPRS/EDGE/3G interface) like:\n<dict>\n<key>Interface</key>\n<dict>\n<key>DeviceName</key>\n<string>ip1</string>\n<key>Hardware</key>\n<string>com.apple.CommCenter</string>\n<key>Type</key>\n<string>com.apple.CommCenter</string>\n</dict>\n\nBe careful that you got the ip1 section if you want to override EDGE/3G! Do not look for the other Proxies entries in the file.\nThen add the following section afterwards: \n<key>Proxies</key>\n<dict>\n<key>ProxyAutoConfigEnable</key>\n<integer>1</integer>\n<key>ProxyAutoConfigURLString</key>\n<string>file:///private/var/preferences/proxy.pac</string>\n</dict>\n\nThen use your trick to specify an SOCKS proxy in the file we just specified:\n/private/var/preferences/proxy.pac\nAdd:\nfunction FindProxyForURL(url, host)\n{ \n     return \"SOCKS 127.0.0.1:1080\";\n}\n\nChange permissions on proxy.pac to 777 (all can read, write, execute).\nReboot the iPhone.\nDownload iTunnel for iTunes 9 (older versions are available too). (http://www.mediafire.com/?2q1fzowoy12)\nCreate a new Putty Connection: in Connection>SSH>Tunnels section add new forwarded \"remote\" port, like port 202 on the iPhone to your internet-facing SSH server (say, 192.168.2.100:22).\nSource Port: 202\nDestination: 192.168.2.100:22\n\nIn the SSH section of the same Putty Connection set your Remote Commmand to:\nssh -D 1080 user@127.0.0.1 -p 202\n\nSave your Putty configuration to a new named session.\nOptionally generate keys & add the public keys to *~/.ssh/authorized_keys* to both ends so you don't need to type passwords. Use putty.exe -load \"Profile Name\" in a shortcut to speed it up even more.\n\nA: Well I guess, there's no better way to do it.  Darn you Apple, is it so hard to put a SOCKS Proxy setting in the iPhone OS network settings panel? \n:-(\nAnyway, the best answer so far, and the only one I could find on the Net, is from a document from the SNIPPLR Code 2.0 website entitled How To Connect To A SOCKS Proxy From An Unjailbroken iPhone/iPod Touch. \nBelow is a cleaned up version of their solution:\n\nLet's say, perhaps, that you are already forwarding your web traffic through an SSH/SOCKS tunnel at work (for privacy reasons) and you would like to use that same tunnel on your iPhone/iPod Touch. This is actually pretty easy to accomplish.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the SOCKS tunnel on your work computer allows LAN connections so your iPhone/iPod Touch can connect to it. \nssh -N -g -D 1080 user@domain.com\n\n\n*Create a text file and insert the following code:\nfunction FindProxyForURL(url, host)\n{ \n     return \"SOCKS 192.168.xx.xx:yyyy\";\n}\n\nReplace the x's with your IP and the y's with the port you used after the -D in your SSH command\n\n*Save the text file as a Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) file to a web accessible place with a .pac extension. \nIf you're reading this chances are you know how to serve a file over HTTP on your work LAN, so I won't delve into that.\n\n*Finally, on your iPhone/iPod Touch, go to Settings \u2192 Wi-Fi and click the blue arrow to the right of your work network. Scroll to the bottom, click Auto and type in the address to your PAC file (e.g. http://192.168.xx.xx/mysupersecretproxy.pac).\nNow you can surf the web securely from your iPhone/iPod touch.\n\nA: This message seems to suggest that it's not possible to do this via the command line, if I'm interpreting it correctly. I think that means you really can't at all, since the Network preferences don't support SOCKS.\n\nA: iPhone + SSH Tunnel + Socks Proxy = SUCCESS Very Happy\n--> http://thireus.dareyourmind.net/index.php/thireus-home-news/8-general-announcement/109-iphone-ssh-tunnel-socks-proxy-success-d\nThanks for the help :)\nI'm now able to use my local socks proxy via Wifi/3G/Edge :p and I also created a script that recreate the tunnel if the connexion has been lost ;)\n\nA: If you have access to the shell (jailbroken) and can place the proxy.pac file in the location mentioned above, you can also use the following link for the proxy.pac file in the Network preferences for the connection you are trying to tunnel:\nfile://private/var/preferences/proxy.pac\n\nTogether with an SSH tunnel to an SSH server in the US, I can listen to Pandora/Slacker etc. over  Wi-Fi outside of the allowed coverage area (i.e. while traveling outside of US).\n\nA: The answers above are not all right.\n\n\n*\n\n*The ssh -D is not a global proxy on iOS system (such as iPhone and iPad).\n\n*The HTTP proxy is also not a global proxy.\nThey cannot both be used on most games and IM (instant message). It just for some web surfing (Safari is all right) but mostly only this.\nThe best and most easy way on iPhone and iPad is using VPN. That's global agent, which can transfer all Internet data via remote VPN server. Another choice is OpenVPN, which gives a client on iOS. \nThere is no such a program for iPhone and iPad to run global socks proxy like that on Windows.\n\nA: I found a way to do this without jailbreaking, but you will need access to an ssh server, which you could host on your own home computer.\nYou will need two iPhone applications; iSSH (ssh tunnel), and ProxyBrowse (socks5 browser).\nYou will also need an SSH server.\nFor this example we'll call our SSH server [host] and our user account for the ssh server [user].\n\nSSH Server\nRun the following command: \nSSH -f -N -D 8080 [user]@[host]\n\nThat's right, you're on [host] creating a dynamic port forward back to [host], you'll see why soon.\n\niSSH\n\"Add Configuration...\", fill out the usual stuff for the server/username/etc. Near the bottom you can choose SSH > None, and you'll see an option for \"Tunnel\", select that. Choose the button to \"Add Tunnel\".\nLocalport: 8080\nDest Host: [host]\nDest Port: 8080\nSave everything and open the connection.\n\nProxyBrowse\nServer: localhost\nPort: 8080\nDon't fill in Username or Password, you won't need to, because iSSH already created the tunnel and iSSH continues to run in the background on your iPhone.\nThat's it, now you can browse the web over an SSH tunnel.\n\nWant to go a step further? Install Tor on your server, have the iSSH tunnel connect to the Tor port, and then from your phone you can truly browse the web anonymously.\nFor the technically inclined who want a little more detail on what just happened:\n[host] : ssh -f -N -D 8080 [host]\n[client_tunnel] : ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 [host]\n[client_socks5] : localhost:8080\n\nThe SOCKS proxy browser communicates over the local port forwarding tunnel to the dynamic port forwarding tunnel on the server.\nrst\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5308", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "23"}}

{"text": "Q: Attaching 3.5\" desktop drive to MacBook SATA I have a mid-2007 MacBook that, according to the Apple Store, has suffered some liquid damage and requires a new logic board to operate correctly, a ~$750 repair I've been told (would normally be around ~$300 were it not for the \"liquid damage\"). The unit itself works fine - the only problem I've been having is that the system does not recognize the battery and will not charge it. Curiously, the system can still be powered by the battery and even recognizes when the power cord is detached by diming the backlight, but I digress.\nNow that this laptop will likely become a desktop, I'm wondering if it might be possible to attach a desktop drive. I recently purchased a 2TB SATA drive and I'm wondering if it's possible to somehow attach it where the current internal drive connects. Obviously the drive itself will not fit inside the device, but as the unit will spend the rest of its days on my desk, that's not really much of an issue.\nMy main questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this possible?\n\n*If so, how would I connect the drive? Would a SATA extender cable work?\n\n*Is the SATA port on my MacBook capable of powering a desktop drive? Or should I just get a SATA male-to-female cable and see if I can power the drive through other means (a cheap power supply, for example)\n\n\nThe disk I'm referring to is the Hitachi Deskstar HD32000. Though I couldn't find that exact model on Hitachi's support site, these are the power requirements for a similar drive, the 7K2000 (2TB, 7200RPM, SATA II):\n\nPower\nRequirement +5 VDC (+/-5%) +12 VDC (+/-10%)\nStartup current (A, max.) 1.2 (+5V), 2.0 (+12V)\nIdle (W) 7.5\n\nFrom what I've read, 2.5\" drives require 5V, meaning that my MacBook obviously is capable of producing it. The specs seem to suggest that this drive seems capable of accepting it instead of the typical 12V - is this an accurate interpretation of the power requirements? Or does it need both 12V and 5V?\n\nA: Just an update - I've successfully connected my 2TB HD to my MacBook's internal SATA data connector. If anyone's interested in doing this themselves, you'll need:\n\n\n*\n\n*external enclosure with eSATA to power the drive (I'm using a NexStar CX with eSata):\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*an eSATA to female SATA cable (I got mine from http://satacables.com, see \"eSATA DATA Cable Extension Male to Female\" near the bottom of the page):\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need to cut those plastic tabs off the SATA portion of the cable, leaving only the section with the pins - otherwise, the cable won't fit in the port.\n\n*Follow iFixit's steps for removing the keyboard section of the MacBook \n\n*Remove the hard drive, connect cable. Since we had to remove the tabs on the cable in order to make the connection, the cable does not latch in place. I recomment taping the table to the bottom of the case where the hard drive was:\n\n\n*Reverse the disassembly steps to put the computer back together, with the exception of the memory cover and the battery. The cable should now poke out of the hole where the battery used to be.\n\n*Install the hard drive in the external enclosure, connect the eSATA and power cables, and enjoy.\n\n\nA: 1) Yes\n2) You have a couple options. You can use an external device such as this that will connect through USB, or you could connect the external SATA drive to the onboard SATA port. You would probably still need an external power source, but I can't find any links to back up that statement. (#3)\nGood luck!\n\nA: I've never done this but one thread I found has some ups and downs with some anecdotal evidence of frying a drive this way. I suppose looking into an external power supply would be best.\n\nA: FireWire 800 would be faster than USB, so I'd look into getting a FW800 enclosure. If it's a Pro model, you could use an expresscard esata adapter (I think the mid-2007's had those).\nLook at OWC's mercury elite external cases. They're expensive, but blazingly fast.. and they look cool. :)\n(EDIT: Whoops, did the mid-2007 macbooks have firewire 800? If not, my bad...)\n\nA: Okay, I've done a bit of looking on this one, because it got me interested.\nIt seems the connector for the sata HD is not really a cable but more of a port that the HD slides into(1). This makes me think your idea of a female to male adapter is a good one. However, I'd still grab an eSATA case, and get something like an eSATA to SATA Type (\u201cI\u201d) to Type (\u201cL\u201d) Shielded External Data Cable with a female->male sata cable for between that and the one inside the lappy. I wouldn't use the laptop's sata power lead to run a full size drive, and this would mean one instead of two cables coming out of the lappy.

{"text": "Q: What devices can receive an AirTunes signal? I'm trying to set up an in-home music system with built-in speakers. Right now I have my Apple TV plugged into the stereo outputting the AirTunes signal to the speakers. However, I'd like to get my Apple TV back at some point, so I've been looking into a replacement unit. The AirPort express and the Apple TV seem to be the only two devices that will seamlessly work with iTunes. New units cost $100, and even the used units command $50-$60 on eBay. It's also possible that I'd like to control several sets of speakers throughout the house, which would require several units for the different audio channels.\nAre there any other pieces of hardware that will perform this task? What about software solutions? I'm aware of Rogue Amoeba's Airfoil, but this doesn't work well with the Remote app for the iPhone, and plus it requires that the software be installed and configured on the streaming computer. Are there any other solutions?\n\nA: As far as I've been able to find, you've covered it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple TV\n\n*AirPort Express\n\n*Airfoil\n\n\nI'm not positive, but I thought that you can use AirTunes from one Mac to another if they were on the same Airport Express network. I don't have my Airport Express hooked up right now. I'll have to test it out later.\n\nA: Ken's got it covered; Airfoil nonwithstanding, you're stuck with either an AppleTV or an AirPort Express.\n(Sidebar: I have an AirPort Extreme, and it does not support AirTunes.  I didn't need it to when I bought mine, but I thought it did for some reason.)\nSo yeah, to do an AirTunes network \"right\", you need a seperate AirPort Express for each set of speakers in the house.  Then you can have iTunes running on your PC as the streaming source, and it all works great - the iPhone remote, speaker selection, etc.\nBut, of course, that costs a bajillion dollars at ~90 bucks a pop for the Express.  Too rich for my blood, certainly.\nI went with the PC, a bunch of speakers, a receiver, a big roll of speaker wire from monoprice.com, and a drill.  Sounds great.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5324", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}
{"text": "Q: Is it possible to hide the dock on a per-application basis? There's an app or two that I'd like to run fullscreen on my Mac. However, hiding the dock manually and unhiding it when I'm done gets tedious. I know there must be a way to get an application to hide the dock when it's active as iMovie 06 used to do exactly this. I also think that I read somewhere recently how to do it, but my search for the particular article comes up empty.\nHow can I get an app to hide the dock when it's active?\n\nA: This can be done, but you cannot hide just the dock per app. It will hide both the Dock and the Menu bar per app.\nYou just have to make a quick, simple edit to the plist file for the application. Check out this article from Mac OS X Hints:\n\nTo hack an app so that when it's active, the menubar and dock are hidden, you need to find its info.plist file. Control-click on the program in question, choose Show Package Contents from the pop-up menu, and then navigate into the Contents folder. \nOnce there, add the following to the file:\n<key>LSUIPresentationMode</key>\n<integer>4</integer>\n\nBe sure that it goes in alphabetical order, otherwise it won't work (i.e. LSUIPresentationMode goes after LSMinimumSystemVersion but before NSAppleScriptEnabled). Save the file and enjoy. \n\nYou can change the value (in the example, it is 4) to 0 - 4. Apple's documentation has more details:\n\nValue: 0\nNormal mode. In this mode, all standard system UI elements are visible. This is the default value.\nValue: 1\nContent suppressed mode. In this mode, system UI elements in the content area of the screen are hidden. UI elements may show themselves automatically in response to mouse movements or other user activity. For example, the Dock may show itself when the mouse moves into the Dock\u2019s auto-show region.\nValue: 2\nContent hidden mode. In this mode, system UI elements in the content area of the screen are hidden and do not automatically show themselves in response to mouse movements or user activity.\nValue: 3\nAll hidden mode. In this mode, all UI elements are hidden, including the menu bar. Elements do not automatically show themselves in response to mouse movements or user activity.\nValue: 4\nAll suppressed mode. In this mode, all UI elements are hidden, including the menu bar. UI elements may show themselves automatically in response to mouse movements or other user activity. This option is available only in Mac OS X 10.3 and later.\n\n\nA: Is this Yosemite? \nYou could just click the green button in the top left corner that takes the app (most are supported) to full screen on a different desktop.  I often have several apps open (on several different desktops) in fullscreen at the same time and have mouse horizontal scroll enabled so that I can scroll between them with a quick simple mouse swipe.

Several responses to a question I asked earlier suggested I try Opera kiosk mode, so I decided to download it and give it a try.

{"text": "Q: How to get iTunes to keep downloading podcasts even if I don't listen to them right away? As the owner of a Mac and an iPhone, I've naturally been using iTunes as my podcasting program. It works pretty well, except for one huge problem: if it determines that I haven't been listening to podcasts for a while it stops downloading them. Is there any way to force iTunes to continue downloading podcasts regardless of how often I listen to them? For most it isn't a big deal, but there are some (like \"This American Life\") that only publish one episode at a time so it's impossible to download the ones that you've missed.\nThis would also be useful to set up an iTunes server that shares the podcasts over the local network - since the podcasts would be listened to remotely, their \"new\" status would not be changed.\nI poked around com.apple.iTunes.plist to no avail - if there is a setting to disable it, it's not labelled in there.\nOne idea I had would be possibly trying to fool iTunes into thinking that the podcast was listened to recently, as one of the criteria for automatically unsubscribing is that it hasn't been listened to in 5 days. Would it be possible to periodically set this value to the current time? Or might it even accept a future time so it doesn't have to be periodically set?\n\nA: Apple covers this feature in their Making a Podcast page.\n\nAutomatic Unsubscribe.\niTunes automatically unsubscribes from\n  a podcast if the following conditions\n  are both met:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The user has not played any episode downloaded in the past 5 updates\n  (there may be more than one episode\n  downloaded per update.\n  \n*More than 5 days have elapsed since an episode was played.\n  \n  \n  In addition to minimizing unnecessary\n  bandwidth costs for both the user and\n  the podcaster, the unsubscribe logic\n  built into the iTunes client makes it\n  more likely that episode downloads, as\n  reported by a podcaster to a sponsor,\n  are roughly in line with actual plays\n  of the episode\n\nAnd as far as I am aware, you cannot disable this feature.\n\nA: There is an Applescript called \"Update Expired Podcasts\" at dougscripts.com.  \nhttp://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=updateexpiredpodcasts\nYou can run this automatically via your crontab or launchd using osacript:\nosascript ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts/Update\\ Expired\\ Podcasts.scptd\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5339", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "22"}}
{"text": "Q: How can I play music from my iPhone through my computer? Now that I've had my iPhone for a few months, I'm trying an experiment to see if I can't replace the laptop I carry around with my iPhone + internet connected computer. To this end, I've been trying to find a program that will let me play the music on my iPhone through the hardware and software on the host computer.\nIf I recall correctly this was possible a few years ago with the iPod - Linux software like Rhythmbox and Banshee was able to read the music off an iPod and play it through the speakers. I even thought I recalled iTunes itself being capable of this at one time.\nNow, however, iTunes greys out/disables the music on my iPhone and I can't find any documented support for the iPhone in any other music program. Is this really no longer possible? Am I limited to using the headphone jack to get music to play?\n(note: I am using an iPhone 3G with the 3.0 software. I am attempting to play music on computers other than the one I sync with)\n\nA: The only way to play the music from your iPod or iPhone is to set iTunes to 'Manually manage  music and videos' on your device. \nTo do this just select your iPhone under 'Devices' on the left, and make sure \"Manually manage  music and videos\" is selected.\n\nClick 'Apply', and now your music should not be greyed out and you are free to play it. You should then be able to use Apple's Remote iPhone application to control iTunes from your device.\nIf you have all your music (and everything else) backed up already, just try it. iTunes can manage iPods funny sometimes and can do strange things (such as warnings like you describe that don't amount to anything). I have done this before to watch a video on another and no content was removed from my iPod touch at all.\n\nA: I came across this question via a Google search and registered just to post what I've discovered relating to this problem. I have a similar situation: I have a home computer that I'm using to sync music with my iPhone 3G S, and a work computer that I'd like to play the music on (without copying the music to the computer). The work computer can see all of the music but it is all greyed out, and when I do the \"Erase and Sync\" dance I get the same results that you do.\nUntil I got my iPhone last week I used to play its music through my work computer without issue with my 80GB iPod 5.5 gen.\nDespite what the other answers here say, everything I've read indicates that this is not possible with an iPhone. I suspect that the other people who have said it works do it with their iPods and just assume it works with the iPhone as well.\nDisappointed that I was losing a feature important to me by replacing my iPod with an iPhone, I set out to find a workaround. The best one I've found so far is this:\nhttp://www.andrewgrant.org/2008/03/30/how-to-sync-an-iphone-with-two-or-more-computers.html\nThe author refers to this technique as a method to allow you to sync with two computers, but I've found it also enables playback of my iPhone's music flawlessly on my work computer. You are essentially tricking the iPhone into thinking it's connected to the exact same instance of iTunes in either location.\nHope this helps you!\n\nA: Run this program on your computer:\nhttp://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/speakers.php\nIf it's a Mac, what you want is Airfoil Speakers for Mac. When the program is running, start playing music on your iOS device. Look in the little menu to right of the start/pause buttons in the iOS device screen. You'll see your computer listed there! Choose it. The sound from your iOS device is now coming out of your computer. If the computer is connected to speakers and using them as its output, the sound is coming out of those speakers.\n\nA: I know I'm replying on an old question, but I came in here googling.\nMy iPhone 4 had the same behavior, I just updated to iTunes 10 and I my music is no longer greyed out.\nIn essence: upgrade to iTunes 10 and you should be able to do this.\n\nA: You can do this with iTunes itself. Enable \"manual sync mode\" and you can then read right off the disk for playback.\nHere is an article with further details.\n\nA: You're talking about DAAP, which is what is used to present and stream music in iTunes (although iTunes also has encryption & friends, but we'll leave that out of the conversation for the moment).\nI think that this article on an app that allows you to turn your iPhone into a DAAP server might be of considerable interest to you.  As in, it allows you to stream your music from your iPhone to another DAAP-capable client, like iTunes...or Banshee...or Rhythmbox...\nAnyways, if that doesn't work, you at least know what you're looking for...and that's half the battle.  Find a DAAP server for iPhone and you're pretty much set.\n\nA: Here is a simple solution for those wanting to play music on iphone through the computer that I am doing.  Use your pc speakers simpy as headphones for the iphone.  Just plug in a 3.5mm jack into the pc audio in (microphone) receptacle and run it to the iphone headphones jack.  Problem solved, you do not have to transfer the songs on your phone to the computer, all controlled by the iphone.    \n\nA: Try using manual sync?  I have only an iPod Classic, but I can still play the music on other computer's using iTunes when I use manual sync...\nI believe I remember reading somewhere that with Auto Sync, you can only use your own library no matter what.\n\nA: update your firmware to the latest iOS firmware, then download a program called shairport4w. Open it up and select the \"change\" option, then rename the Name and create a password. Now start playing music on your iphone and press the icon next to the next track button (it looks like a Arrow pointing into a rectangle) And choose the option that will be whatever you named your computer in shirport4w. you will now be able to play your music through your PC's Speakers - you can change the volume through your iphone/ipod touch.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5342", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "17"}}
{"text": "Q: How can I figure out what's slowly eating my drive space? Every few days I get notices on my MacBook that it's running or run out of hard drive space. Curiously, restarting the computer will enable me to recover gigabytes of space (this past time, it was able to recover about 2.2GB). However, I can't identify anything in my personal activity that consumed that space.\nIt's possible that it's a rogue iTunes podcast or a huge software update that my Mac is automatically downloading - would either of these reclaim the space upon a restart?\nOne possibility that I can think of is that FileVault has some sort of disk leak, allocating but not freeing files. Does this make sense? Is there a tool that I can run to determine where this space is going? Assuming it is FileVault, should I try to disable it? What's the best way to turn of FileVault on a nearly full computer?\nWarning about answers and new macOS\nFor users of Ventura and newer macOS. Apple have increased control of what can be seen by Apps so the apps listed as answers will not work fully without some extra configuration. They will need to be granted Full Disk Access and to see files that cannot be read by the current user will need root privileges - so version from App Store will not provide complete results. See System data storage is huge (This is not part of the question but I can't think of anywhere else to place this as applies to all answers.)\n\nA: It looks like FileVault can cause some issues some issues with free space. Unless you really need the integration that FileVault provides, I would suggest disabling it and using TrueCrypt instead. It is open source and will not crazily eat up free space.\nYou can also check out this guide on how to free up hard drive space on OS X or run a disk usage disk utility (such as one Doug Harris suggested).\nEdit: Since originally answering, FileVault has been significantly overhualled in OS X Lion and is much more reliable.\n\nA: WhatSize\nis a disk space visualizer that costs US $13.00. While similar to other programs described above, it also has a mode wherein you can see, measure and even delete files that belong to the System or other users.\n\n\nA: DaisyDisk (Free Trial, $9.99)\n\nDaisyDisk is sort of like WinDirStat for Windows, in that you can see your files as a visual hierarchy and find out which ones are taking up the most space.\nWhere Daisy Disk excels is two places:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's programmed to efficiently and using parallel processes rapidly search out all the special cases where Apple has filesystem allocations that are more unique to Core Storage and APFS and local snapshots / containers.\n\n*It also explains all of these special cases and errors very well. When you have allocations with large amounts of missing space, it saves you from learning all the details of purging local snapshots in the command line, knowing when it's time to boot to recovery to run Disk Utility to check the disk itself when the graphs don't add up correctly, etc...\n\n\nYes is costs money, but hopefully you save sanity and time in the long run since it\u2019s been a solid tool for many years. \nCredit to Sathya for his answer in Super\u00a0User.\n\nA: There is a good article from Apple on How to free up storage space on your Mac which mentions built-in disk space consumers discovery tools, available starting with macOS Sierra (10.12).\nThe most useful tool is the File Browser which allows you to see which file and folder take how much space. To access it:\n\n*\n\n*\uf8ff > About This Mac, then click Storage (More Info on macOS Ventura 13.0 and newer)\n\n\n*Click Manage... (Storage Settings in macOS Ventura)\n\n\n\n*On next page click Documents (or info button next to it on macOS Ventura)\n\n\n\n\n*Then click File Browser tab and feel free to use it to figure the biggest space consumers.\n\n\nThis tool has a single limitation: it only allows you to browse files within your home folder.\n\nA: Disk Inventory X is another excellent disk space visualizer.\n\nFileVault or any other third party software is not necessary at fault here. \nMac OS X is simply a complex and modern operating system that uses disk space is dynamic and often unpredictable ways. Not only does the swapfile grows and shrinks but OS X also has a sub system that creates a Dynamic Loader Shared Cache that can grow to enormous sizes without your knowledge. The cache is located at /var/db/dyld/\nDo not ever mess with OS X's caches and swapfiles. The cache gets flushed when booting into SafeMode and gets recreated during normal boots. In short, that's simply disk space overhead to run OS X. You can't really recover or control the cache.\nSomeone at macfixitforums.com has kindly compiled a list of usual suspects that snatches disk space in Mac OS  under the posting Where Did My Disk Space Go?\n\nA: Describe me as a minimalist, yet I dropped most of GUI solutions and by experience, I prefer to use the following strategy:\n\n*\n\n*fire up you command-line interface client (terminal, iterm, ...)\n\n*identify the path of the drive that is full: /, /Volumes/data and change to this directory (that is; cd /)\n\n*ask for the size in the hierarchy and sort it: du -k |sort -n\nIt is a quite universal law that \"small files are many, large files are a few, but these are very large\" - such that you may quickly find the culprit.\n\nA: Download and run GrandPerspective for a nice graphical view of what's occupying disk space -- something like this:\n\nRun this before and after the reboot and you should be able to see what the big differences are.\n\nA: I used Disk Inventory as did many others here and found I found multiple files of iphone and ipad backups.  As I drilled down into it, I discovered that I had 4 Gb of backups that were two years old for older devices I now longer used.  This was a nice find on my 128 Gb Hard drive.\nIf you've had multiple devices on your mac, check ~library/application support/mobilesync/backup.  Each backup is in its own folder and the out-dated ones will easily stand out. \n\nA: You don't need any tools if you care to use Apple's included tools.\nStart with System Information and the About this Mac Menu bar item in the Apple Menu.\n\n\n*\n\n*select the Apple Menu\n\n*About this Mac\n\n*More Info\n\n*Storage (top left of the window between Displays and Memory)\n\n\n\nThis tool uses the spotlight data, so if it seems off you can reset spotlight and leave the mac running for several hours to regenerate all the data that feeds the storage usage graph. In fact, on recent OS (10.10 and 10.11) many of the times when free space gradually declines and clears at boot is due to spotlight getting stuck and generating database files on an ongoing basis. You can check for that with a command:\nsudo du -sm /.Spotlight-V100; sleep 600; sudo du -sm /.Spotlight-V100\n\nThat way you get a snapshot of the size of this directory and another 10 minutes later (or more if you aren't watching to re-enter your password)\nIf you need more granular data, use Finder and open a window in list view of the computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shift + Command + C\n\n*Command + 2\n\n*Command + J\n\n\nTick the Calculate all sizes check and then use the triangles to expose folders and keep track of what folders are growing as you use the Mac over a 20 minute period.\nYou can also inspect the filesystem raw access with fs_usage in the terminal app, but it's a bit like trying to take a sip from a fire hose. If you can narrow down a process or a folder to search for with grep the filesystem activity becomes more helpful and useful to know what's happening at the lowest levels of filesystem access.\n\nA: It sounds like the space recovered is from your swap (vm) and sleepimage files. Restarting will clear the files in /var/swap/ which can grow considerably if you're running out of RAM or are using a laptop. If you are using a laptop you'll find a file called sleepimage that is the size of the amount of RAM you have installed and it can be safely deleted - that said deleting anything from here is temporary.\nIf you need more space than I suggest using applications (as suggested) like Grand Perspective or Disk Inventory X to find large files. You can also remove additional language translations by hand or using an application like Monolingual - for example as an extreme iWeb drops from nearly 1GB to ~150MB after running Monolingual.\nIf you want to turn off FileVault you can follow Apple's instructions: by simply unchecking FileVault in the Security Preference Pane in System Preferences.\n\nA: Find the Culprit File. Solution\nAmong all the above Answers.. \nyou could simply hit this command on the Terminal to find out the culprit file... \nThis command finds all the individual files whose size is greater than approximately 100MB and then prints them on the terminal. \nsudo find / -type f -size +100000k -exec ls -lh {} \\; | awk '{ print $9 \": \" $5 }'\n\nIn my case there was a tomcat log file which went to whooping 13GB. \n\nA: One more free and useful Mac disk space utility from The Omni Group, OmniDiskSweeper.\n\nA: Real time visualisation of file system activity\nfseventer\nhttp://fernlightning.com/doku.php?id=software:fseventer:start\nIf you use Lion\nMobile Time Machine\nLocal disk space will be used, intelligently \u2014 never so much to cause an alert from the system.

AFAIR space is freed dynamically, without the need to log out. \nWhether free space was as well managed with FileVault\u00a01 two\u00a0years ago, when the question was posted, I can't recall. \n\nA: I've had a very similar issue, and so I decided to compile several methods for solving it. So, following, there are those options and some of them I got from the answers already provided here. I understand this is a little bit offtopic from the question, but it's in tune with the answers. This has many parts and those are all softwares I could try myself somehow.\nIt's generally a good idea to pay close attention for using the sudo options below so the software can have access to every file, which will likely include some big hidden ones.\n\nHere's a brief list of apps for checking the disk usage:\n\n*\n\n*GrandPerspective is only graphical, using the Treemap, it can measure files by logical or physical methods before scanning, show/hide package contents and change color scheme on the fly. It also is able to save the scanned data for archiving or comparing multiple windows.\n\n\n*Disk Inventory X also uses the Treemap graphical scheme but along side a list view of folders and files. The grahpics isn't as good as GrandPerspective neither the list as good as OmniDiskSweeper, but it does a good job mixing both. It has a Finder plugin and the most options between the 3 on preferences. It's the most complex, but not all complete.\n\n\n*OmniDiskSweeper is non-graphical and very similar to Finder's column view. You choose the folder or disk to analyse, it will order them by disk usage after taking its time to calculate. You can then just delete (move to trash) anything listed.\nSo each one has its advantages and highlights, I'm still not sure if there's one that comes on top. They're all free.\n\nThere is also a different approach, of apps for scanning specific expected places and files for space usage in non-optimal ways. They basically gather some known things about the system that can be bloating your disk all in one nice interface so you can see and decide what to delete.\n\n*\n\n*CleanMyMac lists caches, logs, language files, universal binaries, development \"junk\", extensions and applications. It scans through the files and also uses some knowledge base it has. Great interface, simple to use. CleanMyMac has a free trial which will only clean up to 500 MB.\n\n\n*XSlimmer is very specific. It remove \"unnecessary\" code from \"fat\" binaries and Strip out unneeded languages, as it says on the website. Universal Binaries, that is, use a lot of space for storing files to run in several different architectures and languages. So, this strips all of them to shrink to only your computer needs. XSlimmer is currently discontinued.\n\nAnother approach is looking for duplicate files. There are many commercial options, some may be better than the listed below, I haven't tried them all. Anyway, I'm listing my choice of apps considering which ones I was able to try.\n\n*\n\n*TidyUp is a very well known app in this subject. You can specify where to scan for what kind of duplicates. It offers basic and advanced modes, several different strategies and criterias.\n\n\n*MrClean is a free tool that just scans for folders for duplicates and trash them. Very simplistic but efficient if you're sure on what you're doing.\n\n\n*Chipmunk scans duplicates and let you choose which ones you want to trash. It offers a node-view of folders and you can select to \"delete all files in a folder that have duplicates elsewhere, or vice versa\" as well as hand-picking. It may take very long to scan all files, but it does a very decent job after that.\n\n\n*DupeCheck \"drop a file on it and it will use your Spotlight index to see if you have a potential duplicate somewhere.\" That's about this nice open source app. Not a great tool for space cleaning at once, but over time it helps you keep your space clean.\n\n\n*DuplicateFileSearcher from the website: \"is a free powerful software utility that will help you to find and delete duplicate files on your computer. It can also be used to calculate MD5 and SHA hashes. The software runs in Windows, Linux, Solaris and MacOS.\". Enough said.\n\nNext I'll briefly discuss on a similar approach by quoting relevant parts about two other things that can be done to look for missing disk space, without installing anything new, just using the command line (the Terminal).\nThis (long but good) one is from MacFixIt forums (go there for more options and details):\n\nIn most cases, there really are files occupying part of the volume, but the files are invisible in normal use of the Finder.\nUsing the Finder\u2019s Go to Folder feature (in the Go menu), look at the sizes of the contents of these folders, by pasting in these pathnames:\n/private/var/vm \n/private/var/log \n/Volumes \n\nThe /private/var/vm directory contains the swapfiles used by virtual memory. New ones are made as more data is swapped from RAM to the hard drive. The entire process of creating them begins at each reboot or restart; do not attempt to remove them yourself. Check the total size of all the swapfiles, right after you boot, and as the disk fills up. In Panther, the first two swapfiles are 64 MB, then each new one is twice the size of the preceeding one (128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB, 1 GB) up to a maximum size of 1 GB. In Tiger, the first two swapfiles are 64 MB, the next one is 128 MB, and any additional swapfiles are 256 MB.\nIf you do not run the daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance scripts (either by using a utility, or by running the commands sudo periodic daily, sudo periodic weekly, and sudo periodic monthly in Terminal), the logs on the startup volume can become too large. If an error is occurring frequently and is being logged, you can have a very large file at /private/var/log/system.log.\nThe files in /Volumes should be aliases to your mounted volumes. Do not remove these aliases, because anything you do to them happens to the contents of the corresponding volumes. If you are not confident that you can explore this folder without mishap, before you begin, properly unmount any volume other than the startup volume, if the missing disk space problem affects only that volume. External FireWire drives can be disconnected after proper unmounting.\nSometimes, backup programs that cannot find an intended destination (or target) volume for a backup create a folder with the same name as the destination, and put the folder into the /Volumes directory. There are cases in which the entire startup volume has been backed up on itself, in a folder inside /Volumes. If the amount of missing space is about the size of your user folder, such a backup is likely to be the explanation. If you use Carbon Copy Cloner or another backup or cloning utility and have its preferences configured to create a backup on a schedule, and the intended destination volume is not mounted or is sleeping at the scheduled time, the backup is created in the /Volumes directory.\nTo check the size of the normally invisible /Volumes directory on the active startup volume, open a new Finder window. Select the startup volume in the list at the left, then choose column view (the one at the right of the three views). From the Finder\u2019s Go menu, choose Go to Folder, and paste in:\n/Volumes \n\nThe /Volumes directory becomes visible in the Finder; find its size by selecting it and typing Command I. My /Volumes directory is reported to be 12K.\n\nThis other one is from Mac OS X Hints forums (not much more to see there):\n\nYou may want to run a du in terminal to see what is all going on. This could take a few minutes to run.\nAn example would be to open up terminal.app then run these commands:\nsudo du -h -d 1 -c /\n\nInput your password when it prompts for it then let it go, it will take a few minutes to run so be paitent.\n\ndu stands for Disk Usage. There's also df. I like including the -x to the above command, and sort;\nsudo du -cxhd 1 / | sort -h\n\n\nAdding to the command line option, you could use an automator service for opening any app. With this you will get different (and more complete) results on GUI.\nOr, if you're on a Power PC, using Rosetta or anything before Snow Leopard, you can mix any of the before mentioned apps with Pseudo. It's a little app to open things as admin. Picture it like a GUI for sudo.\n\n\nFinally, there's a complete newbie guide on \"The X Lab\" that I just won't quote here for it's too long.\n\nA: Try the app disk cartography it's completely free and it shows hidden systems.You can also make it show files greater than 1 Gb etc.\n\nA: In my case it was runaway MySQL / MariaDB instance that for some reason had replication turned on , on my laptop.  Found using: GPL tool - Disk Inventory X http://www.derlien.com/downloads/index.html\nIn my case MariaDB - was creating a bunch of bin-log files for replication in /usr/local/var/mysql  50 files at 1GB each ....\n\nA: \"Restarting the computer will enable me to recover gigabytes of space\" is not curious at all; afaik, it is software flushing its caches. For me as a heavy firefox user (100+ open tabs), rebooting my MacBook frees something in the neighborhood of 1 to 2 GB of disk space (which, subsequently, gets filled with new Firefox cache data).\nAFAIK there's other software with bloated caches; I remember from an earlier version of Mac OS X (Snow Leopard?) that QuickTime updates are somewhere stored in the Library and can be deleted.\n\nA: Using OmniDiskSweeper (as suggested in other answers), the culprit for me was GarageBand. The download of Essential\nSounds said \"2.1 GB\", yet the size on disk was 24 GB and likely going to 50 GB (because I paused the download at 1.2 GB for lack of disk space). That explains why my disk space kept growing\neven as I purged more of it.\n\n$ cd /private/var/folders/q8/n9hvxyg92c98xmp5bqsxyrr80000gn/C/com.apple.garageband10/com.apple.MusicApps/audiocontentdownload.apple.com\n$ du -sh lp10_ms3_content_2016/\n 24G    lp10_ms3_content_2016/\n\nI also found out that Homebrew keeps the download of installed versions:\n\nNote downloads for any installed formulae will still not be deleted. If you\nwant to delete those too:\nrm -rf $(brew --cache)\n\nThanks for the answer. What's the use of keeping already installed formulae\ndownloads files around?\nIn case something goes wrong and you have to reinstall.\n\nI had the Glasgow Haskell compiler ghc installed for unknown reasons. Removing it freed another 3 GB, 1.5 GB for the cached download and 1.5GB for the binary files (in ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads and /usr/local/Cellar/ respectively).\n\nA: I use this little app that sits in the status bar and reports the amount of free disk:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/free-disk-space-monitor/id1134777725\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5353", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "130"}}
{"text": "Q: How can I resize a Mac OS X app window after disconnecting from an external monitor? I'm a MacBook user, and when I'm home I plug into a large external monitor to get additional screen space. When I'm on the go I disconnect and use my laptop's built-in display. For the most part this arrangement works very well; however, I occasionally run into an issue where I'll resize an app on the external, causing it to be too large to fit on the built-in screen when I disconnect.\nMost apps don't have a problem decreasing their height automatically or resizing to fit when I click the green orb, but some (like iTunes) don't want to cooperate. How can I resize apps like iTunes without reconnecting to my external?\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n\nA: For 99% of applications: The green button in the top left of any OS X window is called the \"Zoom\" button and will resize the window to it's contents so long as it fits in the current resolution. This is the same as choosing Zoom from the Window menu. \nFor programs such as iTunes that show a completely different mode when you choose Zoom, you can hold the option key when clicking the zoom button to force it to perform the normal zoom action instead of changing modes.\n\nA: Hold down the option key while clicking on the green button.  This should prevent iTunes from changing to the mini-player, and will resize the window as expected.\n\nA: There's an alternative. Use some app such as BetterTouchTool that enables you to resize windows in different ways. On BTT I choose Fn + Option to resize window on top of the mouse.\n\n\nA: You should try a third party window management add on, it'll really suit your power user style.\nTry Cinch, which is a shareware program that adds AeroSnap-like functionality to a mac (like that in windows 7, which allows you to drag a window to the top of the screen to make it maximize, or drag it to either side and make it consume exactly half the screen). \nAlso Stay is a great app for setting specified locations for windows to exist, and have them be restored to that spot every time the display configuration changes or the app is open. (for example you could set your contact list to always be in the rightmost side consuming a small portion of the screen. Everytime ur IM app is opened or a screen is plugged in or unplugged, it'll move back to it's spot)\nyou can see some others i found online on this aricle\n\nA: Starting with macOS Sierra, you can easily resize a window to fit the display. Move the mouse cursor to any edge of the window until it turns into a bi-directional arrow aligned diagonally (as-shown):\n\nNow, press and hold the Option key and double click/tap to change the size of window to fit the screen.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5361", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "17"}}

Replace the source file with the full length .m4r version, then drag it from the Library to your iPhone. iTunes will be expecting the short version but will copy the whole thing without error. \n\n\nPrerequisites: Create two .mp3 versions of the song. One the full length, the other a short version <30sec.\nDetailed instructions:\n1) Create two folders. One with the full length version of the song. The other with a 15s version.\n2) Add the short version to the iTunes Library via File>Add File to Library\n3) Convert the short version to AAC, then search for it in Music. Once you find it, right click to Show in Windows Explorer. Rename the file extension of the short song to .m4r. Keep the Window Open. \n4) Move the .m4r version to the short folder in Step 1. \n5) Remove the AAC listings in the Music Library. \n6) Repeat the AAC conversion for the full version, following Steps 3-5 while working from the full length folder. This is to prevent confusion. Use file size to help separate if needed. \n6) From the short folder in Step 1, drag the .m4r into the Library section in iTunes. \n7) Rename the short .m4r file extension to .m4r_short\n8) Copy the full length .m4r into the short directory. \n9) From within the iTunes Library, open Tones and then drag the song to your iPhone. The entire full length song will copy without any errors. \n\nA: \nI'm wondering if there is a way to extend the maximum duration of ringtones for my iPhone past 30 seconds.\n\niPhone ringtones cannot be longer than 40 seconds.\n\nA: It's not a carrier setting it's a phone setting. Max I've seen is 30 seconds but there may be a way to get around that. I think that the file format .m4r has to be cut down to 30 seconds to work with the iphone. Even when I made custom ones they had to be edited down to 30 seconds.\n\nA: Yes, you can extend your custom-ringtone duration on any iPhone with any iTunes version. No jailbreak required.\nHere's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put your ringtone in your device by using the normal iTunes procedure (sync it, drag and drop in Ringtones, etc.). It must be less than 40 seconds. Say 10 seconds.\n\n*Make sure it's been transferred in your device by going to Settings \u2192  Sounds.\n\n*You can already select it as your ringtone if you wish.\n\n*Download iBackupBot and install it on your computer (available for free for both macOS and Windows, google for it, first result).\n\n*Open iBackupBot. Make sure it detects your device. If it doesn't, just click on the Refresh button (blue circular arrow).\n\n*Click on your device name.\n\n*Click on \"Raw file system\".\n\n*On the right panel, click on iTunes_Control \u2192 Ringtones.\n\n*You will see a random-named file ending with .m4r extension.\n\n*That file is the ringtone. If you have multiple ringtones, you will see multiple m4r files.\n\n*On your computer, convert any full-length song/ringtone of your choice to m4r format. You can use any online service for that.\n\n*Once you got your full-length m4r, just rename it to the one currently in the Ringtones folder of your device (as seen in step 8-9). If you have multiple m4r, just choose one.\n\n*In iBackupBot, click the Import button located exactly on the top of the folder structure.\n\n*Find and select your full-length m4r file.\n\n*Confirm to overwrite.\n\n*Done.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5400", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "19"}}
{"text": "Q: Can you install two versions of an app on the same iOS device? Is it possible to install two versions of an app on the same iPhone and, if so, how?\nThe scenario would be that you have purchased an app, and a recent update has changed some of the features--not necessarily for the better or worse, but enough of a change that you'd like to still be able and use the older version at times. You could downgrade from a backup, but it'd be nice to have the new version at times as well. Is it possible to have two versions of an app be 'seen' as different apps so that they can both be transferred to the iPhone at the same time? \n\nA: It's not so much the name -- at least not the visible one, as an upgrade can change the visible name -- but it's the bundle identifier inside the app that identifies it and allows the OS to know it's supposed to perform an upgrade. The developer has to keep the bundle identifier the same in order to actually provide an upgrade and not a new app, so no, you're out of luck.*\n*Note that there may well be some way to do such a thing if you jailbreak your device, but I have no firsthand knowledge of such.\n\nA: It is possible to install 2 versions of the same app on your device. However, you're the one who gotta edit the .ipa, and it will lose its online features, like syncing with Facebook or something else.\nMatthew Frederick said on his answer to your post:\n\n\"but it's the bundle identifier inside the app that identifies it and allows the OS to know it's supposed to perform an upgrade. The developer has to keep the bundle identifier the same in order to actually provide an upgrade and not a new app\"\n\nYou can edit the bundle identifier, and here's a guide on how to do it:\nLet's suppose you have the version 2.0 of the app installed on your device, and you want the version 1.0 also.\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need those following programs on your computer: \"WinRAR\", \"plist Editor Pro\" and \"iFunbox\" (the last one is to install the older version of the app on your device)\n\n*Download the version 1.0 of the app (.ipa file) from the internet.\n\n*Search for an app that you would NEVER want to download, it doesn't matter what it is, and download its .ipa .\n\n*Open this last .ipa with WinRAR.\n\n*There will be a folder called \"Playload\", open it.\n\n*There will be a folder with the name of the app, open it.\n\n*Double click (to open) the file \"Info.plist\".\n\n*Search for <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>.\n\n*Under it, there will be the identifier, for example: <string>com.company.appname</string>.\n\n*Copy this \"com.company.appname\".\n\n*Close the file.\n\n*Now open your app's older version's .ipa with WinRAR.\n\n*There will be a folder called \"Playload\", open it.\n\n*There will be a folder with the name of the app, open it.\n\n*Double click (to open) the file \"Info.plist\".\n\n*Search for <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>.\n\n*Under it, there will be the identifier, for example: <string>com.2company2.2appname2</string>.\n\n*Replace this \"com.2company2.2appname2\" with the one you've copied earlier.\n\n*That will make your device think it's another app, and not simply replace the one you had with the one you'll install.\n\n*Save and close the file.\n\n*If WinRAR asks if you want to make the modifications, press YES.\n\n*Now open iFunbox, and plug your device into the computer (close iTunes if it pops up).\n\n*On the top left hand corner, press \"iFunbox Classic\".\n\n*On the left, open \"Connected Devices\", then open your device's name (for example, \"Johnny | New iPad on USB\"), then open \"User Applications\".\n\n*On the top, click \"Install App\", and select the .ipa you've just modified.\n\n*Wait for it to install. Make sure the device has its lights off (locked).\n\n*Enjoy the 2 versions of the app on your device :)\n\n\nBut again, don't forget this disables the online features of the app, because of the bundle identifier change. Also be careful not to install the app from Step 3 as this will cause an upgrade.\nThat's the only way I could figure out to do this. There may be other ways.\n\nA: No, it\u2019s not possible to install two versions of an app that has the same name. You\u2019d have to ask the developer to rename it, which I doubt he\u2019ll be willing to do. Although the iOS doesn\u2019t really check \u201cthe name\u201d (like a file manager would do), the develop would have to create another \u201cbuild\u201d if I am not mistaken.\nSo you\u2019re out of luck. Either embrace the new features or find an alternative. :)\n\nA: Mine just gave me to versions of the same app without jailbreaking or using the computer i just go iOS 7.1 and i git two copies :)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5402", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

After I did the update, it takes just a few hours for the battery to run out. Even if I\u00b4m not doing anything with it. I noticed that if I turn off wifi the battery life is great. So I\u00b4m hoping you guys can help me with either a solution to this issue and get it to work normally even with wifi on, or some way to get the wifi turned off when blocking it.\nSome things I already try: - fully discharge the vattery and then charge it to 100% - restore the iPod - Updated iOS again to 4.1 now\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Try to completely disable Push Notifications in the Settings application. This might lead to the iPod not trying to maintain a WiFi connection all the time and thus increase battery life.\n\nA: This would be a combination of the fact that the age of your device means the battery is losing capacity anyway, and the fact that iOS4 is much more resource-intensive. To preserve and keep the battery in good running order, every month or so calibrate it, and make sure the software is always running the newest version, as bug and software fixes can improve battery life. Hope this helps. \n\nA: For others who come across this question:\nI had really bad battery life when my ipod was having a hard time connecting to the network at home.

If you had an old iPod Nano/Classic then I might have suggested 'Rockbox' (give it a google).

{"text": "Q: Install and boot Windows from USB hard drive? I would like to install Windows 7 on an external USB 2.0 500 gb hard drive. Is it possible to both install to and boot from this USB drive from my MacBook Pro 2010?\n\nA: As far as I know Microsoft lock their Operating Systems so that you cannot run them directly from an external storage device. Microsoft say something about it not being a 'primary means of storage.' More like them making an attempt at stopping people running multiple computers of on copy of the OS, as allowing them to install it on any storage would allow people to make loads of copies. Hence, Linux does not have this problem. I personally do not do much gaming, and have never needed Windows on my MacBook Pro, so have not dabbled in the whole 'Windows on my Mac' thing. If you really do have a problem with sticking Windows on the MBP's Hard drive and booting either natively or through virtualisation, then the following links may help, although the guides are designed for XP and I have no idea if they will work on 7.\nPrepping the install CD (scroll down)\nInstalling\nAs I said, I cannot guarantee this will work for 7. I hope, however that I have helped in some way. \n\nA: Disclosure: I have never attempted to install program files to an external drive, so I have no idea on how programs will perform. I supply this answer as a possible solution with no guarantees on performance.\nIf you were contemplating running an entire Windows install off an external drive, you could try boot camping Windows with 20-30 gigs of your SSD. That should suffice for getting Windows operating. You then would have to install games to the external and run them off that. \nI really have no idea if you would be able to get enough bandwidth for loading textures etc from USB 2.0, but then again you didn't clarify what type of games (casual, graphics intensive, etc), so it just might be sufficient.\nTo answer the actual question: everything I have ever read on the subject of actual running full Windows from a USB drive indicates it can't be done. I believe a couple projects have managed to get Windows XP running well enough on a USB drive, but I myself have not used them.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5415", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

I've got a new iMac (Santa must have thought I was a good boy this year) and I want to move data from my 3 year old MacBook (Intel, running Snow Leopard). I realise I have a few options for this, but migration assistant is currently looking better than either starting from fresh or Carbon Copy Cloner etc.\nWhat I would like to know is if migration assistant will bring across everything from a 3 year old system, including all the remnants of applications I have installed and deleted etc. If it does has anyone got any hints to stop it doing this?\n\nA: I've migrated between many macs over the years, and I've always found that the best way to do it, is manually. Normally I use a firewire cable (but you can also use WiFi, USB, external hard drive, dvd/cd, etc) to hook up the two computers, then just drag over files from one computer to the other.\nMostly everything the average user has on their mac will be found in their user folder (home folder). You can just drag/copy this entire folder over, or you can be more selective about which folders in your home folder you move (for instance, you may not want the Library folder). Then, anything outside of your home folder (Applications, for one) you can drag/copy over if you want.\n\nA: You should not use CCC between Macs. Every Mac has a set of drivers configured for the current hardware during installation. When you use CCC to clone to another Mac, you are getting the setup, which is not optimized for that Mac.\nUse Migration Assistant. I had to migrate several Macs in the past, restoring from the Time Machine or copying from older Macs. Migration Assistant never failed. I have lots of apps and some of them are copy-protected and have own drivers (I am a developer). Migration Assistant took care of almost all of them. I only had to confirm Adobe CS3 serial once.\nGo for Migration Assistant: a couple of clicks, wait and you are done.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5418", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "14"}}

This tool can provide extensive SMART monitoring but it's command line which a lot of people don't like. Everything else costs money - I suppose some people have actual costs, like food, water, heat, mortgage, etc. etc.\nZVH, over on MacRumors, has written a list of drive testing tools but beware most of these cost money:\n\nMac hard drive test software - creating the definitive list\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Disk Utility, diskutil (FREE, comes with OS)\n  \n*Smartmon Tools (FREE, Open Source)\n  \n*SMARTReporter ($4.95 for commercial version, but an older version is FREE)\n  \n*Scannerz Lite ($21.95)\n  \n*Scannerz with Phoenix and FSE-Lite ($39.95)\n  \n*Disk Tools Pro ($79.99)\n  \n*Disk Warrior ($99.00)\n  \n*Drive Genius ($99.00)\n  \n*TechTool Pro ($99.99)\n  \n\nThat's actually a really good report. Interesting that nearly no one commented on it. In any case, I think you get what you pay for. Tools like Disk Warrior and Scannerz are known to do very limited things but do an extraordinarily good job of doing it, while other \"Swiss Army Knife\" tools apparently do a decent job, but not really all that thorough. The author only identifies a few applications as \"free.\"\nAlthough I find SMART status useful, I wouldn't base my life around SMART reports and would recommend that people do web searches about the reliability of SMART testing before using it as a defacto standard.\n\nA: I assume you are aware of the Shareware tools (Like the five mentioned in this article).\nIn any case, since you want the free option, you will have to rely in your common sense and the tools you have (this is also true for the Shareware options, which really don\u2019t seem to add much at this stage). Most of the benefit of TechTool Pro and DiskWarrior is to have am emergency plan in place in case of hard drive failure. But that is to be done before the problem :)\nBack to your case, I suggest you give Onyx a try to check the status of your HDD\u2019s Smart status. Assuming you don\u2019t hear strange noises in the drive, performing a full Clone to an external drive using Carbon Copy Cloner would provide you with an important piece of information: the computer can read your entire drive, block by block. \nBoth Onyx and OS X can verify your volume so I suggest you also perform a verify (using Disk Utility for example) and verify your permissions. \nFinally, use AppleJack to execute some of the above tests to make sure that the OS is in Single User. \nIf after performing all of the above, you see nothing \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d, you don\u2019t hear \u201cstrange click noises\u201d or you don\u2019t detect any strange slowness in your drive, you can assume that the drive has not suffered any damage. \nBut, all things said, I\u2019d keep my backups up2date just in case. (You do have backups, don\u2019t you?)\nI\u2019ve had drives fall from a desktop to the floor and survive for years without any problems, and some drives tipped 0.5 inches and instantly died. Hard drives are like unicorns. :)\n\nA: If you haven't already, you should pop open Disk Utility, select your drive, and click the Info button. Ensure that the SMART status is \"Verified\". \nOf course if you hear any audible clicking or anything of the sort, then you'll likely want to order a new HDD now (then again, I figure you haven't heard any clicking, and are wanting to check the health of the drive to ensure it is okay).\n\nA: Sounds like your best recourse would be to pull the hard drive and test it in a Windows Machine, or dual-boot Windows on your Mac.  Software that's actually useful, like Seatools, which does far more than Smart Monitoring, and is far better than the sub-standard disk utility built into Mac.  \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5424", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "14"}}

{"text": "Q: Why did syncing with iTunes delete one of my photos folders? I have an iPod Touch, and I tried to sync with apparently more room than my iPod Touch had on it.  So instead of not syncing some new podcasts, it decided to delete one of my photos folders off of my iPod Touch (over 5000 pictures).\nWhy did the iPod Touch determine that this should be deleted? Why didn't it give me a warning or a prompt so I could have chosen what action to take?\n\nA: Suggestion 1 :\nI think you would be a new user to the iPod/iPhone/OS X/iTunes family. \nIf your afraid or don't understand what is happening during synchronization using iTunes, I suggest you to use a utility called iPhoneExplorer.\nJust Explorer the iPhone/iPod/iPad like a file system. You would get your images under Root/User/Media/DCIM/ directory. images are grouped in directories like 100APPLE, 101APPLE and so on. Just explore and copy it.\nSuggestion 2:\nSynchronization - means A single machine and an iPod synchronization. Not multiple machines and an iPod. If you synchronizes from other machine it will erase all of your old data. According to me, you had the problem just because you might have synchronized from other machines iTunes. \n\nA: In my experience iTunes treats photos as the least important content on an iOS device, whenever there is too much music selected to sync a pop up tells me that there was not enough space to sync all of my photos to the iOS device. I don't think this can be changed.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5429", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

(The first time you do this, it can take a few seconds to index the man page files, so wait a bit for results to appear, but subsequent searches are fast.) It will show man page results in the Help menu search results. Selecting one opens a window displaying the formatted page.\nAs of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, there are a number of enhancements to man page support:\n\n\n*\n\n*Man page searching lets you supply section numbers/names in various formats: \"2 open\", \"open 2\", \"open(2)\". It also supports asterisk \"*\" for wildcard searches.\n\n*It now searches all the files in MANPATH (prior to Lion it only searched a fixed set of directories, so, for example, it didn't find any X11 man pages). It doesn't run in a shell, however, so if you want to customize MANPATH you may need to customize man.conf (x-man-page://1/man), or set it in your global environment.\n\n*There are commands in the Help menu for opening man pages (Open man Page for Selection) and performing an apropos search (Search in man Pages for Selection). There are corresponding commands in the contextual menu, and there are Services you can enable to perform these lookups from other applications (System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services > Open man Page in Terminal / Search man Pages in Terminal).\n\n*If there is no selected text, Open man Page for Selection will automatically look at the text to the left of the cursor. This means you can enter a command name, then use this command to open the man page before entering command arguments. It'll skip over whitespace. It also understands man page references \"open(2)\" and URLs \"x-man-page://2/open\". (If you explicitly select text, it also understands \"2 open\" and \"open 2\".)\n\n*Man page windows use the \"Man Page\" settings profile. You can customize this to alter the appearance of man pages displayed using these commands. It also remembers the position of man page windows separately from other windows, so you can have man pages appear in the same place on screen each time, independent of where you place other terminal windows.\n\n*\u2318+ double-click will open man page references \"open(2)\", enabling you to navigate references from one man page to another. (\u2318+ double-click will also open any recognized URL, or even some patterns like email addresses\u2014creates a new mail message\u2014and domain names\u2014opens in Safari.)\n\n*When viewing a man page window (or any terminal whose commands have all completed/exited), Terminal supports some \"less\"-compatible pager commands: space = Page Down, \u21e7+space = Page Up, F = Page Down (\"forward\"), B = Page Up (\"back\"), \u232b = Scroll down one line, \u2191/\u2193 = Scroll up/down one line.\n\n\nA: $ emacs -batch -l dunnet\n\nDead end\nYou are at a dead end of a dirt road.

The\ntrees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant\nfrom each other.\nThere is a shovel here.\n>\n\n\nA: afconvert allows you to convert from and to all audio formats internally known to Core Audio.\ne.g., converting an aiff file to 160kbps AAC:\nafconvert track.aiff -o track.m4a -q 127 -b 160000 -f 'm4af' -d 'aac '\n\n\nA: Quickly check what is eating all your memory:\ntop -o vsize\n\nAnd for your CPU\ntop -o cpu\n\nQ to quit\n\nA: To make ctrl+\u2190 and ctrl+\u2192 useful again, that is going a word forward or backward like they usually do on Linux, you must make Terminal.app send the right string to the shell. In the preferences, go to the Settings tab and select your default profile. Go to Keyboard and set control cursor left and control cursor right to send string \\033b and \\033f respectively.\nWhile your're at it, you can also fix Home (\\033[H), End (\\033[F), Page Up (\\033[5~) and Page Down (\\033[6~) so that they send those keys to the shell instead of scrolling the buffer.\n\nA: Resample image so height and width aren't greater than specified size, e.g. 100x100:\nsips -Z 100x100 image.jpg\n\nsips supports other operations such as: flip, rotate, crop, image properties query, colour profile query and modification. Check man sips for usage.\n\nA: Command line shortcuts to toggle visibility of hidden files in finder:\nalias show_hidden=\"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE && killall Finder\"\nalias hide_hidden=\"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE && killall Finder\"\n\n\nA: This is more a Terminal meta-hint - you can use \nCmd-Shift-{Left arrow, Right Arrow} \n\n(Command Shift combined with left or right arrow) to quickly cycle between open Terminal.app windows.\n\nA: Here is a script that gets the path(s) to the current selection(s) in Finder: \n#!/bin/sh\n\nosascript` << EOT\n\ntell application \"Finder\"       \n        set theFiles to selection\n        set theList to \"\"\n        repeat with aFile in theFiles\n                set theList to theList & POSIX path of (aFile as alias) & \" \"\n        end repeat\n        theList\nend tell\n\nEOT\n\nHow I use it:\n$ cat `selected`\n\n\nA: If you need to open a Finder window as the root user, you can execute the following from the terminal:\nIn 10.5 and below:\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder\n\nIn 10.6:\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder\n\nThen, open a new finder window.\nYou'll see that the new finder window opens with root permissions.\n\nA: Flush the DNS cache if you are editing /etc/hosts a lot to test staging servers as looking like production.\ndscacheutil -flushcache\n\n\nA: Ok, definitely not mac specific, but TAB completion in zsh  is so good I  think it deserves a specific mention.\nYou get completion of options, e.g. \nfind . -d[TAB]\n\nwill give you -daystart -delete -depth as possible completions.\nAlso path completion is improved over Bash completion, for example, I have a Volume called Wubly, and inside that video/tv/comedy, so typing:\ncd /v/w/v/t/co[TAB] \n\nwill expand to.\ncd /Volumes/Wubly/Video/TV/Comedy\n\n(note that it's also case insensitive.)\nIf there are multiple paths that match this pattern, they will be shown.\nCompletion is also interactive, so you can move around the available choices with the cursor controls.\n\nA: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal will open a new window if you drag a folder (or a text pathname) onto the application icon. If you drag to the tab bar of an existing window, it will create a new tab in that window.\nYou can also do this from the command line or a shell script:\nopen -a Terminal /some/path/\n\nThis is the command-line equivalent of dragging a folder onto the Terminal application icon and will open a new terminal window at \"/some/path\".\nTerminal also now supports Services for opening a terminal at a selected folder (e.g., in Finder) or a text pathname using the contextual menu. You can enable them in\n\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services\n\nLook for New Terminal at Folder and New Terminal Tab at Folder. You can even assign command keys to them if you like.\nFinally, if you drag a folder or pathname onto an existing tab (i.e., the tab in the tab bar) and the foreground process is the shell, it will execute a \"cd\" command in one step. As in previous versions, dragging a folder onto the terminal display will insert the pathname to the folder.\n\nA: If you\u2019re like me, you have multiple Terminal.app tabs open at the same time.\nNow, if you open three tabs at the same point in time, then enter some commands in each of them, then close them all, the Bash shell that Terminal.app uses only remembers the command history for the last tab that you close. So, the command history from the other two tabs gets lost.\nIf you don\u2019t want to lose your command history in any tab, add this to your ~/.bash_profile (or any other file that gets sourced when a new Terminal tab is opened):\n# Append to the Bash history file, rather than overwriting it\nshopt -s histappend\n\n\nA: When cding, one of the most useful features is tab completion.\nFor example, instead of entering cd FooBarBazBax, you can enter cd FooB followed by Tab. Tab completion will work as long as the part of the path or filename you entered isn\u2019t ambiguous.\nHowever, if you were to type cd foob followed by Tab, the completion wouldn\u2019t work, as the folder name starts with an uppercase F. Luckily, you can make tab completion even more useful by making it ignore the filename case.\nAdd this to your ~/.inputrc file (create the file if you don\u2019t have it already):\n# Make Tab autocomplete regardless of filename case\nset completion-ignore-case on\n\nThis way, cd foob followed by Tab would complete it into cd FooBarBazBax, provided there\u2019s a folder with that name in the current working directory.\n\nA: Just type \npurge\n\nand it will make inactive memory as free again. Mac OS X keeps apps in memory for a while after you close them, so they will open fast if you open them again.

Here you have:\nCHFLAGS(1)        BSD General Commands Manual           CHFLAGS(1)\n\nNAME\n     chflags -- change file flags\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     chflags [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] flags file ...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The chflags utility modifies the file flags of the listed files as speci-\n     fied by the flags operand.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -f      Do not display a diagnostic message if chflags could not modify\n         the flags for file, nor modify the exit status to reflect such\n         failures.\n\n     -H      If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line\n         are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal\n         are not followed.)\n\n     -h      If the file is a symbolic link, change the file flags of the link\n         itself rather than the file to which it points.\n\n     -L      If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.\n\n     -P      If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.\n         This is the default.\n\n     -R      Change the file flags for the file hierarchies rooted in the\n         files instead of just the files themselves.\n\n     -v      Cause chflags to be verbose, showing filenames as the flags are\n         modified.  If the -v option is specified more than once, the old\n         and new flags of the file will also be printed, in octal nota-\n         tion.\n\n     The flags are specified as an octal number or a comma separated list of\n     keywords.  The following keywords are currently defined:\n\n       arch, archived\n           set the archived flag (super-user only)\n\n       opaque  set the opaque flag (owner or super-user only).  [Directory\n           is opaque when viewed through a union mount]\n\n       nodump  set the nodump flag (owner or super-user only)\n\n       sappnd, sappend\n           set the system append-only flag (super-user only)\n\n       schg, schange, simmutable\n           set the system immutable flag (super-user only)\n\n       uappnd, uappend\n           set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)\n\n       uchg, uchange, uimmutable\n           set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)\n\n       hidden  set the hidden flag [Hide item from GUI]\n\n     As discussed in chflags(2), the sappnd and schg flags may only be unset\n     when the system is in single-user mode.\n\n     Putting the letters ``no'' before or removing the letters ``no'' from a\n     keyword causes the flag to be cleared.  For example:\n\n       nouchg  clear the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)\n       dump    clear the nodump flag (owner or super-user only)\n\n     Unless the -H or -L options are given, chflags on a symbolic link always\n     succeeds and has no effect.  The -H, -L and -P options are ignored unless\n     the -R option is specified.  In addition, these options override each\n     other and the command's actions are determined by the last one specified.\n\n     You can use \"ls -lO\" to see the flags of existing files.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The chflags utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     ls(1), chflags(2), stat(2), fts(3), symlink(7)\n\nHISTORY\n     The chflags command first appeared in 4.4BSD.\n\nBUGS\n     Only a limited number of utilities are chflags aware.

It's gotten me out of some binds. It's not too hard to use.\n\nA: I\u2019m not sure; this might work in any decent terminal application, not only in OS X\u2019s. However: \nUsing Terminal.app it is possible to put status information to the actual title bar and not just to the prompt.\nIn order to do that, you need to change the PS1 variable in bash to the following model:\nPS1='\\[\\033]0;TITLE\\007\\]PROMPT'\n\nWhere TITLE and PROMPT must be substituted to the actual commands which provide the status information. For example, \\w lists the current full path; \\W the directory name. You can even execute a command by putting it in backticks. (So you could even put the output of arbitrary commands to the title \u2013 or to the prompt.)\nGit users (with git\u2019s bash completion installed) might find the following useful. Add this to your .bashrc\nexport GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1\nPS1='\\[\\033]0;`__git_ps1` \\w\\007\\]\\h:\\W \\u\\$ '\n\nand the title bar of Terminal.app will show the current git branch (and whether it\u2019s clean or not) followed by the current full path. This gives useful information about where you are only when you need it and does not make the actual prompt overly long.\nIn case you don\u2019t use git very much and only care about the path in the title bar:\nPS1='\\[\\033]0;\\w\\007\\]\\h:\\W \\u\\$ '\n\n\nA: The say command invokes the system text-to-speech capabilities.\nsay \"Hello there.\"\n\n\nA: !!\n\nRuns the last command again.

It furthermore allows one to \"cd\" to a file, which is very helpful when you want to change your directory to that of a given finder file. Simply write cd, and drag the file to the terminal and your are there.\nAdd the following to your .bashrc or .alias file\nalias cd=mycd\n\nmycd(){ \n  if [ -f \"$*\" ]\n  then\n   \\cd  \"`dirname $*`\"\n  else \n    \\cd \"$*\";\n  fi\n\n  echo \"\\cd \\\"\"`pwd`\\\"\"\" > ~/.todir  ; \n  PS1='\\[\\033]0;`pwd | xargs basename`\\007\\]\\e[31m\\w:\\e[0m\n'\n}\n\nFinally, you need to change your terminal settings: \nIn terminal:settings:shell - make the shell complete the following command:\nsource ~/.todir; clear\n\nNext time you start your terminal - you will automatically be redirected to your last opened directory - the terminal title will change title when you use the cd alias, and your prompt will show the full directory path.\n\nA: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal supports a few \"less\"-compatible pager commands when there are no processes running in a terminal. This is useful for paging through and reading text after commands have completed/exited.

New tabs, gooood.\nIn general, Safari\u2019s tab controls are wonderful, but one failing drives us crazy: Certain links are allowed to override your preference for opening new webpages in tabs, essentially forcing the application to open a new window. To prevent this in the future, execute this command: defaults write com.apple.Safari TargetedClicksCreateTabs -bool TRUE.\n\nShow Hidden Files in The Finder\nThe names of hidden files always begin with a period--keep that in mind before you delete or edit a file that doesn\u2019t look familiar.\nBelieve it or not, the files you see listed on your Desktop in the Finder do not represent all of the files contained in your Desktop folder. In almost every folder, the OS hides system files that Apple considers too important for the likes of us to mess with (or too mundane for us to be bothered with). Now and again, though, it\u2019s useful to view these files. To see the full contents of all folders in the Finder, execute :  defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE.\n\nDisable the Dashboard\nWhen the Dashboard appears on our Desktop, it\u2019s usually because we missed the delete key and hit F12 instead.\nWe\u2019ve always liked the Dashboard in theory--on occasion, we\u2019ve even downloaded widgets for it. Unfortunately, we never get around to using them, and our aging Mac laptop could use the extra RAM to run real apps. If you\u2019re in the same boat, free up some system memory by terminating the Dashboard with two quick Terminal commands. First, set its default to Off by executing : defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES. Second, kill and restart the Dashboard and Dock with this command: killall Dock.\n\nA lot more on this website : Click HERE\n\nA: pg with no arguments ping the IP 8.8.8.8 (usefull for basic internet connection test), otherwise ping the given IP.

I just renamed it to Tiger Terminal.app, and it still runs fine on Leopard.  Haven't tried it on Snow Leopard.\nSo, with Tiger Terminal, you can do mouse-free copy by typing \u2318+\u2325+\u232b, then using the arrow keys to move to the start of the area you want to copy.  Next, type \u2318+\u2325+\u232b again to anchor the selection point.  Use the arrow keys (some emacs-like commands also work for navigation like ctrl+E) to move to the end of the region you want to copy.  Finally, type \u2318+\u2325+\u232b again to copy selection to the clipboard.\n\nA: BBEdit version for viewing man pages:\nbbman () {\n  MANWIDTH=160 MANPAGER='col -bx' man $@ | bbedit --clean\n}\n\n\nA: List all directories alone in a directory - er - folders in a folder.\nls -la | grep '^d'\n\nFind sizes of given directory - again - er - folder.\ndu -s dirname\n\n\nA: user42053 mentions adding a file -i to every folder.

It's a standard feature, but more important as the \u2325 key on macs works different as on \"windows/Linux\" keyboards. \nYou can set the behavior of alt key in preferences to behave like on \"windows\" keyboards. Though you then will be unable to type important characters as @, \\, {, ... \nVery important if you use emacs in terminal.

This is probably not something you want.\n\nA: Local Web Server with Ruby\nHere is the Ruby alternative to the Python one-liner for a local HTTP server (that is also posted in this thread):\nruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000\n\nThis will open a server in the working directory with a port number of 8000 so that you can access it in the browser at http://localhost:8000.\nChange the 8000 to any port number that you would like to use.\n\nA: Many answers have been given about how you can drag files and folders into the terminal window but Ciar\u00e1n Walsh has made a utility called drag that allows you to drag files OUT of the terminal window. It\u2019s even better with my patch that allows multiple files per drag operation.\n\nA: I could not believe that the following is missing here. The best improvement of a OS X terminal is to make it feel UNIX/Linux like. My first intention was to show you a proper bash-completion completing several things like ssh or git correctly. I'm talking of standard behaviour I was used to from Linux.\nBut much more important is the missing package manger homebrew. With this you will get plenty of standard unix commands/apps/libraries.\nFirst install homebrew via\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)\"\n\nand then get the sophisticated bash-completion via\nbrew install bash-completion\n\nDont ignore the message. You will have to edit .bash_profile. But its worth it. bash-completion completes brew too.\n\nA: Ctrl+D is a shortcut for exit. Useful if you often work in nested ssh sessions.\n\nA: It's been mentioned already that dragging a folder into a terminal app will get the path typed directly in it. You can additionally drop a folder onto the terminal app icon and a new terminal will be opened in that path directly\n\nA: While a top already mentions option (alt)-click to move to a position in the line, in reality this works anywhere in the terminal. I use it most prominently in text editors.\nAnywhere you can get by arrow-ing alt-click will get the cursor there as well.\nThis is the main reason I stopped using tabs in code in the early 90s, NCSA Telnet included this functionality back then for mac's System 7 and if tried to arrow its way through tabs, so it ended up going all over the place and beeping like crazy.\n\nA: I use a lot this command\necho | pwd | pbcopy\n\nIt's simply copy current path to clipboard. I've also binded it with path alias \nalias path='echo | pwd | pbcopy'\n\n\nA: Add aliases for phrases that you commonly mistype\nalias sdou='sudo'\nalias suod='sudo'\nalias sodu='sudo'\nalias gerp='grep' \n\n\nA: alias alias_open=\"mate ~/.oh-my-zsh/lib/aliases.zsh\"\nalias alias_reload=\"source ~/.oh-my-zsh/lib/aliases.zsh\"\nalias lsa='ls -lahG'\nalias l='ls -la'\nalias ll='ls -l'\nalias sl=ls # often screw this up\nalias ..='cd ..'\nalias ...='cd ../..'\nalias ....='cd ../../..'\nalias .....='cd ../../../..'\nalias ......='cd ../../../../..'\n\n#######\n# GIT #\n#######\nalias gd=\"git diff\"\nalias gl=\"git log\"\nalias gu=\"git up\"\nalias gs=\"git status\"\nalias gf=\"git fetch\"\nalias gr=\"git remote -v\"\nalias gp=\"git push\"\nalias gph=\"git push heroku master\"\nalias gps=\"git push staging staging:master\"\nalias gpg=\"git push github master\"\nalias gpo=\"git push origin master\"\nalias gplh=\"git pull heroku master\"\nalias gpls=\"git pull staging staging:master\"\nalias gplg=\"git pull github master\"\nalias gplo=\"git pull origin master\"\nalias gpl=\"git pull\"\nalias gc=\"git commit -am\"\nalias gco=\"git checkout\"\nalias ga=\"git add .\"\n\n##########\n# SYSTEM #\n##########\nalias cwd='pwd | pbcopy' #copy the working directory into the clipboard\nalias grep=\"grep --color=auto\"\n\n####################################################\n# Create box of '#' characters around given string #\n####################################################\n\nfunction box() { t=\"$1xxxx\";c=${2:-#}; echo ${t//?/$c}; echo \"$c $1 $c\";echo ${t//?/$c}; }\n\n########################\n# Rip audio from video #\n########################\n\n# (\"$1\" for output file & \"$2\" for input file)\nfunction audioextract()\n{\nmplayer -ao pcm -vo null -vc dummy -dumpaudio -dumpfile \"$1\" \"$2\"\n}\n# extract audio from DVD VOB files\n# USAGE:  audioextractdvd input_file.vob output_file.ac3\nfunction audioextract_dvd()\n{\nmplayer \"$1\" -aid 128 -dumpaudio -dumpfile \"$2\"\n}\n\n#######################\n# Backup .bash* files #\n#######################\n\nfunction backup_bashfiles()\n{\n  ARCHIVE=\"$HOME/bash_dotfiles_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz\";\n  cd ~\n  tar -czvf $ARCHIVE .bash_profile .bashrc .bash_functions .bash_aliases .bash_prompt\n  echo \"All backed up in $ARCHIVE\";\n}\n\n\nA: Useless, but fun.

It frees up all of your active and inactive RAM.  It's useful for people like me who do a lot of audio production (or any kind of media editing for that matter) when you only have 4 GB RAM.  You would be surprised how fast 4 GB gets used up.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5435", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "404"}}
{"text": "Q: What's the point of the 60W Apple MagSafe replacement charger? One of the cable tabs on my MagSafe charger for my MacBook came undone, so I took this as a sign to retire the charger to home use and to purchase another for travel. When I went to my local Best Buy, they had two chargers for sale, 60W and 85W, that looked the same size, sold for the same price, etc. The only difference was that the 85W supported the MacBook Pro, while the 60W only supported the MacBook.\nEven though I am a MacBook owner, I figured I might, sometime in the future, purchase a MacBook Pro and I went with the 85W charger. When I opened it up I found it was slightly larger than the 60W charger it was replacing, but for all intents and purposes there's no real difference between the two. So why does Apple sell a 60W replacement (or even manufacture the 60W at all)? Are there enough people that want to save 25W?\n\nA: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=6301678\nSounds like it does work just fine.  You cannot use the smaller charger with MBP of course.  This is also the case with the MBA which uses a 45watt version.\nIn addition to what rangerpretzel said, which is the main technical reason:\nBut also, size matters to some, MBA users want portability. the 45 watt version is much smaller and the 60 is smaller then the 85.  Some people want the smallest one compatible with their computer.  Also, the original 85 watt magsafe power supply used to be even larger then it is today and was a concern at the time of release. Apple eventualy re-engineered it to the size it is now.  \nCost wise, it might make more sence to just make one power supply, but apple does offer its users a \"few\" options. haha.\n\nA: You definitely don't need to worry about your laptop being fried by the higher-capacity power adapter, because the laptop will only draw what it needs.\nMy 6-year-old laptop came with a 65W power supply. When I bought it, I could have gotten it with a 90W power supply, but I opted for the smaller power supply.  The docking station that I purchased later came with a 90W power supply which can also plug directly into the laptop.  I've noticed that the 90W supply charges the laptop faster, but I prefer it mainly because it has a much longer power cord.\nThe efficiency figures Ranger has hypothesized are not necessarily accurate; it depends on the design of the specific power supply and the optimal load range. A given power supply may be more efficient under your own typical usage scenario, but the only way to find out for certain is to test each power supply's power draw yourself under different loads.  For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plugged into the wall, but not into a laptop\n\n*Laptop fully charged and turned on (idle)\n\n*Laptop fully charged and maxing out power draw (e.g., transcoding video while burning a CD)\n\n*Laptop charging but turned off\n\n*Laptop charging and turned on (idle)\n\n*Laptop charging and maxing out power draw (e.g., transcoding video while burning a CD)\n\n\nYou may find that the higher-wattage power supply is actually significantly more efficient under a high load than the lower-wattage power supply, because it is not near its maximum capacity.  In fact, you may find that the higher-wattage power supply is more efficient across the board, and the lower-wattage power supply only beats the bigger supply under a narrow range of loads. Or perhaps the smaller supply is never more efficient, and its only advantage is its smaller physical size.\n\nA: Most of the anecdotal evidence is that there are no problems, and this extends to a member of Apple Store staff who say they use MBP charger to charge all laptops and if you read the small print they are suitable for both MB and MBP.\nI did find one person who said that their batteries \"burnt out\" while using the 85w charger with a MacBook but this seemed so far from the normal tale (that everything was fine, of which there are hundreds of accounts) that it may have been down to something else.\nBut it doesn't answer the question why do apple do it.  It would be simpler (certainly) and cheaper (probably - just down to bulk buying) to standardise.  The fact they haven't makes me think that there may be a reason, however it may be historic.  For instance it may be that the new MacBooks may run fine on either charger while the old ones don't.  To avoid having to specify model and year and risk selling someone a charger which will melt their old laptop, they may have just decided to stick with MacBook charger and a MacBook pro charger and avoid confusion.\nThe 60w adaptor incidentally is underpowered for the MBP - battery charging takes longer and it will get very very hot in extended use.  It works but really not advised.\n\nA: Most switching power supplies are most efficient when operating at 50% capacity. And they're definitely pretty inefficient at less than 20% capacity.\nSince the MacBook draws less power than a MacBook Pro, I would suspect that an 85w power supply would work just fine, but the larger power supply for the MBP probably would draw more power from the wall socket than is necessary when connected to a MB because it is operating in a suboptimal capacity range.\nHere's an example: Take for example the 45w power supply for the MacBook Air. Sure you could hook up the 85w power supply, but since the MBA might only draw 20 watts, the power supply is operating at less than 25% capacity. At this capacity, the power supply may only be 60% efficient (an educated guess), that means the power supply has to draw 33 watts of AC power just to supply the laptop with 20 watts of DC power.\nLong story, short: It's a power conversion efficiency thing. I'd say buy the one that is designed for your laptop so that you save energy.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5533", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "17"}}

You can get more information on the individual leases by looking at ipconfig getpacket $INTERFACE, but not the date of when the last lease was issued/deleted.\nWhat happens is that the ipfw firewall was blocking the ports used by DHCP.

My got a new Mac for Christmas and I'm trying to help her import a bunch of DVDs with home movies transferred from VHS into iMovie 11. \nGoogle turns up several results but most are trying to sell you an app to rip encrypted DVDs. Other results suggest using Disk Utility to copy the DVD into a .dmg file which iMovie would recognize as a camera it could import from, but that doesn't seem to work with the current version.\nI was able to use Handbrake to rip it to an MP4 and import that into iMovie but I'm curious if there's a more efficient way that avoids two transcodes and would be easier to explain to my mom.\n\nA: Not really, you've utilised the quickest, easiest and cheapest route available with doing it with Handbrake. Don't bother trying to find another piece of software that will do the job better, Handbrake is really the best when it comes to ripping and encoding Apple friendly formats. Thanks, hope this helps.\n\nA: Handbrake is free but not the most user friendly. Here is a great tutorial on using Handbrake: http://www.methodshop.com/gadgets/tutorials/handbrake/index.shtml\nMy personal favorite (for ripping movies for playback on your Mac) is MacDVDRipper Pro ( http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/31118/mac-dvdripper-pro) which actually rips the disk image to your Mac retaining the menus and extra features you might have on the DVD. Then you can mount the disk image on your Mac and use it like a \"virtual DVD\". This software is not free though.\n\nA: iMovie can import QuickTime movies, DV video and MPEG 4 video. What's in the VIDEO_TS folder is MPEG 2 video, so that's not on the iMovie list. There are several applications available that will convert video from a VIDEO_TS folder to one of the formats usable in iMovie. MPEG Streamclip is popular. Cinematize is designed for this. Toast and Popcorn 2 can do it.\nYou do not need to rip DVDs unless they are encoded with copy protection. So if these are DVDs you recorded you can just drag the VIDEO_TS folder to the hard drive to copy them and don't need another commercial product. I mention this because the main reason people use iMovie is for their home videos, not for editing movies from commercial DVDs.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5597", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: Tidy up iTunes library? I am trying to do a spring clean on my iTunes library. I have around 500 songs that are tagged incorrrectly. The Name is in the format '11 Artist - Song Name'. Is there any quick way of extracting this and retagging the files without manually editing each of them?\nCheers\n\nA: You could possibly write an AppleScipt to go through selected tracks, and change the name that way, but you would have to make sure you only select the ones in that format. \nIve had to do this a few times before, and have tried various apps, but usually end up just digging in and doing it manually. While it takes time, I can give a lot more care to each thing, espc. artwork and genre at the same time. I usually just take a night and go through everything in groups (like artists starting with an A, then a B, etc). \n\nA: Four suggestions of apps I've used in the past. Only one of them is free (and go figure that one isn't exactly iTunes-friendly, not easily anyways).\n\n\n*\n\n*Pollux - Pollux was featured on net@nite (Amber MacArthur and Leo Laporte), and subsequently died off for months due to illegally using various APIs from services like (IIRC) MusicIP, GraceNote, and other big name commercial music vendors. After negotiating agreements with companies that could provide plenty of helpful information, they re-launched the product with a 20 song tag trial, and unlimited tagging for $10. I believe this is the cheapest app that integrates as well as it does into iTunes.\nIt's UI is geared heavily towards albums, wherein you select all the tracks in an album, then click the Pollux icon in the menu bar, and then click \"Tag\". It goes about it's business pulling information, cover art, and more (where possible), then does it's work. Updating your music with pretty information.\nAfterward, you won't re-live this terrible memory.\n\n*TuneUp - TuneUp is similar to Pollux, except it's a bit... obnoxious. It runs as a separate app that shrinks iTunes and places itself it the far right of it, like an even more annoying sidebar than Ping. Again, choose your song(s), tell it to \"Clean Up\", and off it goes searching the internet for all the same information you want to make your information clean as a whistle.\nYou can buy TuneUp for $20 for a year (warning: automatically renewing), or $30 for life.\n\n*Song Genie - I'm actually quite a big fan of the Song Genie and Cover Scout duo, perhaps solely because it's UI/UX is ahead of it's curve. You open the app and you get to work. TuneUp is too small and has too few options for checking the details of the data, and Pollux is one-shot (though it allows you to rollback the last action, thankfully).\nSong Genie uses fingerprinting to identify the song and pull in data. It works very nicely with the iTunes Library, or even any arbitrary folder on your drive. It \"rates\" your data, and can fill in the gaps marvelously well (lyrics where you had none previously despite having plenty of other information). With a large, attractive, simple interface, it's actually pretty easy to whip through tagging in a quick manner (subject to the CPU speed of fingerprinting, and your internet connection for searching). Unfortunately, this dream team duo is expensive. $30 for Song Genie, and $40 for Cover Scout.\nI note also their site says \"Your Special Price\", so there may be some sort of active deal at the time of writing.\n\n*MusicBrainz Picard - Picard is in a class all it's own. It doesn't integrate alongside iTunes well, and it's UX flow is god awful. However, if you want absolute control in tagging, nearly the experience of manually writing tags, with just a bit of assistance to make sure you're doing it right, Picard cannot be beat. (And yes, this is a good thing.)\nPicard is not at all hands off, unlike the majority use cases of the rest of the apps, but this makes it awfully better for more nich\u00e9 releases, and bonus: If it can't find something, do the work and contribute back to the MusicBrainz community! We'd be glad to have you as long as you follow the rules and contribute responsibly.\nPicard is free, no ads, no account required unless you want to contribute, and I highly suggest you use the Intel-only -NX version, unless of course you don't have an Intel CPU Mac.\n\nA: As noted by others This can be done by an AppleScript.\nLuckily for iTubes there is a collection of scripts to do things with iTunes Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes and for your particular case look at tag script or others\n\nA: Try Jaikoz. It is a tool for identifying and tagging songs.\nIt doesn't use the name of the file or the tags for that. It \"listens\" for the song and generates an \"id\" for it (search for MusicId in Wikipedia), then searches for that id in MusicBrainz (a giant music database, with better tags than cddb or Gracenotes).\nThe GUI isn't terribly appealing, tough.\nThe benefit of Jaikoz is that it doesn't use the metadata already in the file, that could be wrong. MusicBrainz has very high standard for its tags and is strongly curated.\n\nA: What I would suggest is select original tracks by album, one album at a time, and then find the option to 'Get Track names' or something to that effect and click it. That should work, and then move on to the next album. Then, if you have an iTunes account you can 'get album artwork' for even more organisation.

KeyRemap4MacBook allows you to set key re-mappings based on what application you're currently using.  \nI am using a setting that switches F1 through F12 to standard Function keys whenever I'm using RDC (Windows Remote Desktop).  Any other time they operate like their icons (brightness, volume, play, etc).\n\nA: There might be an easier way, but the following comes to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on Universal Access.\n\n*Create an AppleScript or Automator App that toggles this via the UI.\n\n*Bind that app to a key combo.\n\n\nA: I\u2018d suggest you try FNable. FNable will switch the behavior for the active application, when you tell it to. The next time you activate this application, FNable will automatically switch your function keys.\nThat way you can use brightness/volume controls in most of the apps you are using and you can use the function keys in those apps where you need to.\nNo configuration needed, switching behavior is just a matter of a single click.\nIf you want to use a global hotkey to toggle the function keys, FNable supports that, too.\n\nA: This can be done natively with no 3rd party software needed by opening System Preferences -> Keyboard, and then check/uncheck the box that says \"Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\". If checked, the keys act as F keys, if unchecked, they act as the system control keys, such as screen brightness, volume controls, etc. (I can't think of a better way to describe them).\nSource:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204436\n\nA: i know this is an old question, but what helped me that i didnt find here is using fn + esc. this toggles between using F keys and the media keys.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5619", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "24"}}
{"text": "Q: Can I use Apple Earphones with Mic on Mac Mini? I read on Apple website that Mac mini audio port supports the apple earphones with mic. Does it support the mic as well? Can I use the mic for Audio input on applications like Skype?\nI tried plugging it in but the audio input did not work...\nUpdate: Here's the apple website where its written that Support for Apple iPhone headset with microphone is there. Mac Mini Specs Page\nUpdate: I think I've got what the problem is. The specs page I referred to above is about the latest Mac Mini. What I have is the Mac Mini mid 2007 model. I checked its specs and there is nothing about support of Apple earphones with mic. I think this is the reason its not working.\nRegards\n\nA: You cannot directly plug your headphones into the Audio Input jack and have it work, because, the microphone/button signal rides on the third ring, and the audio input jack only connects the first two. You have to have specially designed hardware to connect to that third ring. This is currently achieved via the Headphone/Audio Output ports of devices.\nOnly the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad, 2010 MacBook Pros, and the modern body (smaller height) Mac Minis are the only pieces of hardware I am aware that do. Anything older will not support the microphone/button/volume buttons at all.\n\nA: Have you tried plugging it into the headphone jack?\nSounds screwy, I know, but I think that's the answer.\n\nA: If the website or documentation explicitly states that it supports 'Apple Earphones with Mic' or something to that effect while still mentioning the mic, then yes, you should be able to use then as you would on an iPhone, in Skype or whatever. HOWEVER if they don't work in the input port then they will not work at all I didn't think that any other devices except the MBP and the iOS devices worked with them. Sorry.\n\nA: I had the same issue and had to use an adapater. I've found this one.\n(just for info, I'm not affiliated in any way with the site).\nI suppose you can find other brand and stores providing the same type of adapters.\nEdit: It seems not to be possible with \"normal\" headset mic but they state clearly that the Apple headset is compatible. How would it be amplified?\nStrange for our mic, I'll have to check at the office how we are using this then. I'm confused now :-/ I know we also have amplified mic and we probably went this way then...

{"text": "Q: Can iTunes combine identical podcasts? Somewhat similar to this question, but I don't just want to import.  I have a bunch of This American Life podcasts that I downloaded using iTunes on another computer.  I also have a This American Life podcast subscription on my current Mac with a bunch of podcasts downloaded.  \nI have already imported the old ones into iTunes.  They show up as two separate podcasts, with the same name and metadata.  The old ones have a \"subscribe\" link but I haven't clicked it, they're just sitting there.  The new ones are subscribed and regularly downloading new episodes.\nHow can I merge the old ones into the newer, subscribed version of the podcast in iTunes?\n\nA: This has been bugging me for years, most specifically with This American Life and To The Best of Our Knowledge.\nThe tag that's causing them to be separated is not available via iTunes -- you need an extended tag editor. On the Mac, I used ID3 Editor. \nInstructions specifically for ID3 editor:\n\u2022\u00a0Open a \"good\" podcast file (you can drag it straight from iTunes onto the ID3 Editor icon in the dock to open). \n\u2022 Click on the Podcast tab. Look for the field called Feed (It may have a different name if you're using different tag editing software). Copy the Feed field contents.\n\u2022\u00a0Open your \"bad\" podcast files, paste/replace the \"good\" Feed info into the Feed field (they should be different - mine were) and click Update.\n\u2022 Last important step is that you have to delete the \"bad\" files from iTunes and reimport them. If you right click or control click the file in iTunes before deleting, and select \"Show in Finder,\" the enclosing folder will open. If you sort by date modified, all the podcast you just updated should be at the top, if they're in the same folder. Then you can delete all the bad ones, and drag them back into iTunes. Whey they're re-imported, they should now be grouped with the \"good\" podcast.\n\nA: Select 'em all, and go to File-> Get Info. If any usual fields are blank, this means that they vary among the selected tracks. If it should be the same, type in the right value.\nThis procedure almost always fixes this kind of a problem.\n\nA: Follow-up on what Nathan G. said: sometimes, it helped me when I checked fields that were filled in to overwrite these values, so not only the empty fields, but title and album as well (probably all fields but title would be fine).\nAlso, as a last resort, all metadata for each podcast are written in /Users/YOUR_USER_ID/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml.

It seems that every couple times I quit Firefox, it will reopen itself automatically.

Another thing I just noticed is that after it reopens, Firefox is 'hidden' (like when you click 'Hide Firefox' from the main menu) until I click on it.  \nIf I quit FF a second time, it stays closed.

{"text": "Q: Enable 3-finger swipe for home and end in Chrome 3-finger left and right swipes on my trackpad work in Chrome.  They take me back one page in my history or right one page.  However, 3-finger up and down swipes does not appear to be implemented.\nIn Firefox and many other applications, an up or down swipe works the same way as hitting the home or end keys, respectively.\nIs there any extension, application, or tweak that will enable this functionality in Google Chrome?\n\nA: Something that may be of interest is Chrome does support 3 finger swipe down, but it's semi-hidden; and not what you're looking for. But it's way cool. The way to access it is by simply typing about:flags into your address bar. You'll see the option at the top. It's called:\nTab Overview:\nSwipe down with three fingers on your trackpad to see an overview of all your tabs. Click on a thumbnail to select it. Works great in fullscreen mode.\nSo this suggests that they will not be doing what you would like them to do. It would obviously conflict with Tab Overview. So you should look into an app like JiTouch if you want to get more customized gesture support. It will do what you're looking for.\nMy guess is that Google's next step will be to map fullscreen to 3 finger swipe up; especially given the emphasis Lion will be putting on fullscreen mode apps.\n\nA: BetterTouchTool is the answer!\nYou can get it from here. It helps you configure all gestures globally or for a specific application.

{"text": "Q: Is there an iPhone dock with a headset jack? Does anyone know of a dock for an iPhone that has standard usb data/power, but also a headset jack (not just speaker / headphones output)?\n\nA: I wonder what is that for, if it's to connect to a stereo, the jack on the Universal Dock is more than enough.\n\nIf the idea is to use the phone to answer calls while in the dock, I would strongly suggest a Bluetooth set as that's what they are made for. You will find plenty on the Apple Store as well.\n\nA: The biggest problem you face here is the fact that you want to use your phone, as a phone, while in a dock.\nFirst problem:\nMany docks are \"not compatible\" with the iPhone, they don't have GSM noise filters on their speakers, so if you dock it and listen to music, you get that god awful chirping when the GSM radio starts going.\nSecond problem:\nThose that are, make data connections, not line-out connections! The only way to fulfill this request is;\n\n\n*\n\n*if the chosen dock connects not only via data, but ALSO via the headphone jack, and;\n\n*that connection is a triple-ring connection, just like the iPhone headphones. Note that you're highly unlikely to find this, because docks are for data/playing audio (which can be accomplished via the audio jack), the \"dock your phone and use the computer as a gateway to phone functions\" use case is, unfortunately, not present.\n\n\nThird problem:\nThe iPhone is too smart. A while back I was driving with my phone plugged into a line-in port on my car (for music), and I was received a phone call. I had guests in the car, all friends, and figured I would just let the conversation take place via the car stereo, and turn on speaker so the other part could adequately hear me. No such luck. When not on speaker, the call came out of the ear piece only, when on speaker, the call came out of the speaker ports. The iPhone will only use the headphone port for a call if it has a microphone attached.\nBluePhone Elite was an option for this (with serious caveats), but it never had terribly good support for the iPhone. Only because of the limitations imposed by Apple. And, apparently BPE is dead now? What a shame. That was a good app for many many other phones.\nI'm (unfortunately) very confident in saying that you will have a very hard time finding this dream product of yours, and you're better off simply plugging your own headset into the headphone port, or like balexandre suggested, pair a Bluetooth headset. A product like you want will invariably not pass Apple Certification, which means you will not easily find it in any mainstream store (not only Apple Stores, but BestBuy and it's ilk).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5639", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: Spell Correction using only the keyboard I am a long time OS X user and as such, I often enjoy the built-in dictionary available system-wide. It\u2019s a small detail that, if you come from Windows (or Linux) turns out to be of great help (provided you really care about improving your typing skills). Available on most Cocoa applications by default (thanks to the underlying technology), it underlines incorrect words and obvious grammar errors. It has its bad days, but the results are usually better than nothing. I type mainly in English and Spanish and in both cases, it\u2019s a decent solution. \nBut I just realized that I have a problem with it. I rarely use the mouse when I\u2019m in \u201cType Mode\u201d. If I\u2019m writing I don\u2019t need to use the mouse. I just don\u2019t use it; I manage to perform most of what I have to with the keyboard and its shortcuts. \nThere are notable exceptions to the above (where a dialog requires mouse action, or there\u2019s simply no way to get the focus of a particular UI element). Those exceptions are annoying (and frequent), but I guess I already deal with them (by grabbing the mouse and killing a kitten). \nHowever, there\u2019s one that I\u2019d like to know how to solve, and maybe the minds behind the site can clear for me. \nImagine the following simple scenario. TextEdit. \nYou start typing this: \n\nIn order to fix the misspelled word, you have a few choices with your mouse, or you could use the \u21e7Shift\u2318Cmd: combination to bring this:\n\nHowever that dialog doesn\u2019t have keyboard focus and I am unable to get it, so I have to reach the mouse, click on it, and fix the problem. That\u2019s not good.\nWhat I want is to be able to bring this:\n\n\u2026with my keyboard. \nThat menu came when I right clicked on the word. \nHow do you deal with this? Do you use the mouse? Do you use the keyboard?\nEnlighten me please. \nUPDATE FOR LION OS X 10.7\nAs many of you are aware, OS X 10.7 \"Lion\" is out and it brings some changes in this area. Sadly, the biggest complain is still not 100% fixed.\nThe good news is, it is \"possible\" to spell check using the keyboard only, although we still don't have a nice popup like the \"right click\" over an underlined word. \nThe Spell Check pane can be focused now by using \u2303F6 if it loses focus, but has it by default when you invoke it with \u21e7\u2318:, this allows you to invoke it over a red-underlined word and press \u23ce to change the word (or TAB to focus the list of alternatives and then \u23ce to change it)\u2026 but not really because\u2026\n\u2026the Bad news is, if I make a mistake right here and I try to bring the spell check, it will go to the next mistake, not the word I have below the cursor, which is annoying, because it means you have to actually go back with the cursor before invoking the spell checker. \nAlso there are no shortcuts on the Grammar Pane, so you have to TAB around the fields to click anything other than \"Change\". The order of the options is also weird:\n1) Upon launching Grammar Pane, focus is on Change for \"return\" but you are ready to start typing a replacement if you want. So you could type the \"right word\" and press return, or you could press return to accept the first replacement on the list, or you could press TAB to move to that list, select a new one (with the arrow keys) and finally press return to accept it.\n2) If you wanted to move to the next change without accepting anything for the current word, you need to press TAB four times and then the space bar to click on find next. \n3) Focus is one way, if you reach the last option in that dialog, it won't cycle back to the first option, so you have to shift-tab back in the focus chain. (weird?)\n4) You can't focus the Define, Guess or Automatic by Language Buttons/Combo boxes, unless you grab your mouse. \n5) You can dismiss the panel by pressing escape.\nFinally, going from \"mistake to mistake\" is achieved with \u2318;; this will jump from red underlined word to the next in a cycle.\n\nA: Yo !

It will give you list on the spot.\n\n\nA: I just went through Apple's Keyboard Shortcuts Document and really didn't fine anything meaningful. I picked some of the more vague ones and tried them out in TextEdit to no avail.\nWhile I don't want this to be the answer, my current idea is to use Mouse Keys, as silly as it is to say.

{"text": "Q: Restricting Command+tab options to only apps that are in the current space Edit: The original accepted answer is no longer valid for Mavericks.  I am keeping it accepted for historical reasons, but all readers using Mavericks should use and up-vote this answer.\n\nBy default, pressing \u2318+tab will display a list of all open applications.  I would like that list to only include applications in the current space, or at least give priority to applications with windows in the current space.  In other words, I'd like OS X to mimic the behavior of most X window managers with respect to their workspaces/virtual desktops.\nHere's my rather long-winded explanation of why I want this:\nI have disabled spaces' auto-switching, and I've mapped each space to a \u2318+space # shortcut.  In general, I usually have one application open per space, maximized.  Since I really only ever have a half-dozen or so applications open at any time, I can easily switch between them in constant time with my left hand.  The problem is that I sometimes do have two or three windows from different applications open in the same space (e.g., I often have a PDF reader open in the same space as my web browser).   Let's say I have a terminal open in Space 1 and both a web browser and Preview open in Space 2.  If I am in the terminal and then decide I want to open a web page, I switch to Space 2, where the web browser has focus.  I then want to consult a PDF that is open in Preview, which is in the same Space but whose window is behind the web browser.  If I hit \u2318+tab, however, the first option will be to take me back to Terminal in Space 1 (since Terminal most recently had focus).  In the worst case, I will have to cycle through all n open applications by repeatedly pressing \u2318+tab in order to get to Preview.  I want the first hit to \u2318+tab to bring me to the next application with windows in the current space, i.e., Preview.\nI know that using Expos\u00e9 is the more \"Apple\" way of handling these situations, but I want to avoid having to reach for the mouse.  I know I can also use the arrow keys to select a window in Expos\u00e9, but once again that breaks my mental model of the window layering, will institute a cognitive feedback loop in the selection, and will require worst case log(n) keystrokes.   As far as I know, there is no constant-time way of switching to a specific application in the current workspace using only the keyboard.\n\nA: control+F4.  Cycles through the applications in that Space.\n (I actually have this mapped to control+`; which I find easier to remember, being close to the cmd+`; to cycle through an application's windows.)\nTo change the keyboard shortcut, go to the Keyboard preferences, Keyboard Shortcuts, and Keyboard & Text Input.  It's the 'Move focus to active or next window' option.\n(Edit to fix the keyboard shortcuts; I didn't realise that the backtick character wasn't showing up.)\n\nA: I'm the author of the Command-Tab Plus application which allows you to quickly switch between applications, and additionally between windows (using MacOS's cmd+tilde ability). Here's a demo on YouTube.\n\nA: Yosemite\nThis behavior can be mapped to your desired key combination like so:\n\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboard > Move focus to active\n  or next window\n\nMavericks\n^F4 does switch through windows in the current space but you may have to upgrade to Yosemite to map this behavior to ^~.\nBut the problem can still be alleviated like so:\n\nSystem Preferences > Mission Control > Uncheck \"When switching to an\n  application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\"\n\n\nA: As an aside to this answer, I've been able to remap control+F4 to alt+tab, which feels quite natural imo.\n\nA: I found the open source app alt-tab-macos does exactly what OP wants: Providing an app switcher for apps on the current desktop only.\nIt also works well for full screen / minimized / hidden windows as well as across multiple display situations where Mission Control and macOS work more on spaces as opposed to separate displays.\n\nA: Pressing \u2303F4 will do what you're asking for, but you might get carpal tunnel in the process.\nJust from reading your example, it sounds like you may actually be looking for \u2318\u21e7\u21e5, which cycles through applications in reverse order, thus cutting the number of times you press \u21e5 in half. \nGranted, that's not be a constant time solution, but I think you'll find that the result of \u2318\u21e5 is the application you want to focus on 70% of the time, and  \u2318\u21e7\u21e5 is the application you want to focus on 28% of the time.\n\nA: One powerful tool is hammerspoon.\nFrom its webpage:\n\nThis is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine. What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user.\n\nUsing hs.window.switcher one just adds (as mentioned in the docs) to the init.lua\nswitcher_space = hs.window.switcher.new(hs.window.filter.new():setCurrentSpace(true):setDefaultFilter{})\nhs.hotkey.bind('alt','tab','Next window',function()switcher_space:next()end)\nhs.hotkey.bind('alt-shift','tab','Prev window',function()switcher_space:previous()end)\n\nand one can happily switch between windows in the current space using alt+tab and alt+shift+tab.\nIf you like Lua scripting, you can extend the tool easily. Moreover, there are numerous plugins, called spoons, available. See also official hammerspoon spoons.\n\nA: After trying many options I went for Contexts which costs 10$.\nYou can configure it so that cmd-tab shows only\u2026\n\n*\n\n*application of current space (see command-tab setting show windows from \"visible spaces\")\n\n*hide some windows (\"background\" apps such as VPN to which I don't need to switch to)\n\nIt organizes the icons in a list (vertically) instead of the default horizontal layout, which I needed to adapt to, but on the other side it also let's you search through all open apps with ctrl-space and there the list layout is beneficial.\n\nA: I know Hyperswitch didn't exist when that question was asked, but it is a modern answer to that question, and it is much better than hacking with Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook) and/or struggling with the system preferences (since they don't accept any key mapping for every command).\nPlease see https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/127414 and upvote it if you find HyperSwitch useful.\n\nA: You can try with Switch\u00e9. They pretend that \"Switch\u00e9 works great with Spaces and is able to display Space number badges\".  As I'm not using Spaces I cannot confirm nor infirm but it's worth the try.\nSee comments below.\n\nA: Although this doesn't technically answer the original question, those here looking for a more configurable Cmd-Tab app switcher could look at\nSuperTab .\nDisclaimer: I bought this and it think it's well done.\n\nA: for those searching where that keyboard shortcut is located:\n\nI've mapped mine to option + tab\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5668", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "135"}}

{"text": "Q: Are there any performance limitations when running a VM of a Boot Camp installation? I'm planning on installing Windows on my Mac, and would like to be able to use both Boot Camp (for when I need to be able to use all of the hardware of the computer) and a virtual machine (for those times when I don't want to restart).\nI noticed that both VMWare Fusion and Parallels allow you to set up a virtual machine which uses the Boot Camp installation, which is exactly what I want because I want to have one installation of all the programs.\nHowever, I'm wondering if using a virtual machine with the Boot Camp installation has the same exact performance as creating a brand new virtual machine.\nThe thing that prompted me to think that they might not have the same performance is the marketing text on VMware Fusion's website:\n\nBoot Camp Improvements \u2014 Up to 5x faster disk performance with Boot Camp virtual machines and a new option to disable authentication.\n\n... which I understood to mean that, in the past, a normal virtual machine (i.e. one that doesn't use Boot Camp) was faster than one that uses a Boot Camp installation, and now with the upgrade, it's 5x faster... yet it's still not as fast as the normal virtual machine (since then they would probably mention that it's now as fast as a traditional virtual machine).\nIs there a performance difference when using a normal virtual machine vs. one that uses a Boot Camp installation in VMware Fusion or Parallels? If so, which one is faster and by how much?\nUpdate: Since there are two attributes to compare, the wording is a bit confusing.\nFor clarification, let:\n\nA = Performance of normal VM on VMware Fusion 3\n  B = Performance of Boot Camp VM on VMware Fusion 3\n  C = Performance of normal VM on VMware Fusion 2\n  D = Performance of Boot Camp VM on VMware Fusion 2 \n\nI understood the marketing text to mean B = D * 5, and I inferred A > B since they mention that Boot Camp needed improvements, and rather than saying it's now as fast as a normal VM, they give a \"5x\" figure.\n\nA: As I use it on regular basis I can say it's good performance of using Bootcamp installed windows via VMWare Fusion 3.\nHere is process I followed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a bootcamp partition using Bootcamp Assistant for the space.\n\n*Install the Windows XP version.\n\n*Open the VMware and select the bootcamp partition, when you create a new virtual machine for Windows.\n\n*VMWare installs few utilities on the bootcamp partition, to use it to boot via Fusion.\n\n*Once all this is done, you can launch this windows version like a normal virtual machine in Fusion.\n\n\nIf I want a lite usage of windows I will boot via Fusion, if I want to run heavy programs then I will boot into Bootcamp, but I rarely does it, as Fusion VM is 99% OK for me for all activities including development with Eclipse.\n\nA: A Boot Camp VM is slower for two reasons: the NTFS driver used is slower than whatever a normal VM uses, and also, the Boot Camp partition is placed on the innermost (slowest) section of the hard drive platters. \n\nA: I have exactly the same question, and have yet to find a good answer. In the past (before Fusion 3.1), I understand that a virtual disk was generally faster, because: a) this could take advantage of host cacheing, etc. and b) Fusion still had to tunnel through the host OS to access the Boot Camp partition, since the hard drive is really \"owned\" and managed by the host. I'm not sure what changed in 3.1 to increase the performance by 5x, but apparently it can now access the BC partition much more efficiently.\nIn my case, I actually have a second physical hard drive in my Mac Pro that is dedicated to Windows. So, theoretically, Windows could talk directly to this hard drive without going through the host OS at all. I'm not sure that Fusion is actually able to recognize this special case and do that, but it would be awesome if it did, similar to the way the guest OS can \"own\" certain USB devices.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5673", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

How?\n\nA: Looks like it's available in MacPorts, so you could install MacPorts and then install Nautilus using that:\nsudo port install nautilus  \n\nYou should then be able to run it using the nautilus terminal command.\n\nYou may see the following during installation:\n############################################################################\n# Startup items have been generated that will aid in\n# starting dbus with launchd.

In the other answer(s), there seemed to be some confusion about whether it would be possible to prevent the Finder from running.\nUnlike an application such as the Dock, the Finder isn't considered a \"required\" application. For example, if you were to write an AppleScript to the effect of tell application \"Dock\" to quit\"and then run it, the loginwindow would immediately re-launch the Dock, since it assumes the Dock must always be running. With the Finder, however, as long as you quit it in a way that allows OS X to know that you had a clear intent to do that, the loginwindow won't relaunch it.\nTo do that, all you need to do is simply tell the Finder to quit rather than trying to kill it. When you kill the Finder forcibly by using the Force-Quit option or by using kill or killall in Terminal, loginwindow (or launchd for your user account) will immediately try to relaunch it because it saw that it terminated \"unexpectedly\".\nTelling the Finder to quit via an Apple Event won't result in it automatically being relaunched.\n[EDIT]: In more recent versions of macOS, as I mentioned in this answer, it's possible to prevent the Finder from running by running the following command in Terminal:\nlaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Finder.plist\nAlternatively, in older versions of OS X, an AppleScript like the following could be run at login to quit the Finder:\nproperty runningApps : {}\nproperty assureQuitMenuItem : true\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to set runningApps to name of every application process\n\nif (runningApps contains \"Finder\") then\n    tell application \"Finder\" to quit\nend if\n\nif (assureQuitMenuItem) then\n    set quitMenuItem to missing value\n    try\n        set quitMenuItem to (do shell script \"/usr/bin/defaults read com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem\")\n    on error\n        set quitMenuItem to \"0\"\n    end try\n    if quitMenuItem = \"0\" then\n        do shell script \"/usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem 1\"\n    end if\nend if\n\nA saved version of this in application form is at: QuitFinder.zip\n(You can open the application in AppleScript Editor to see its contents by dragging the script app icon onto AppleScript Editor's application icon).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5685", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "24"}}

This is working fine, except then whenever someone creates a new file or directory, it does not have the same permissions and we have to repeat the whole permissions process before everyone can access it.\nIs there a way that we can set permissions for all new files/directories created within that directory?\n\nA: Another approach is to use Terminal (a.k.a shell or command prompt) to create/edit (must be performed as super-user, see sudo) the file: /etc/launchd-user.conf adding the line:\numask 000\nsave and reboot. New files/folders (including files changed by save as) will allow everyone read/write.\nThis works by changing the default file creation permissions for programs, whereas the ACL approach works in terms of access rules bound to particular files and folders.\nWithout this tweak, files are created allowing user: read-write, group & other: read-only.\nIf you are sharing between multiple computers, you need to do this for all computers that will use the share.\nIf you have existing files and folder in the shared area, you need to make them all readable/writable by everyone using:\nsudo chmod -R og+w <shared-folder-name>\nThe command reads in English as change mode, recursive through all sub folders and files, other & group permissions add write access, starting at folder with .\nThis approach is mentioned in forums to work with at least as early as 10.6 and still works on 10.7.\nOther factors still affect access to content. For example, permissions set in the Sharing control panel, home folder permissions/ACLs, and when using Terminal any umask in effect for the shell.\nLook up umask and Posix file permissions for details on these Unix concepts. In the write ups, the word directory is Unix parlance synonymous with folder. You will also encounter the terms UID and GID: user and group IDs, which define the Posix ownership of running programs (processes). Note that UIDs and GIDs are numbers which may be the same or different for a given user name across different computers. These numbers are assigned to names in the order accounts are created on a given computer, typically starting with ID 501. Home networks lack a mechanism to harmonize these assignments across computers. Therefore on network shares a file may appear to belong to different users because the user ID to user name binding is determined from the perspective of computer is accessing the file. So shares really always allows everyone to access files to various degrees of everyone. In other words, the Posix \"other\" permission is an indefinite limit on access ranging from allowing a quite predictable but apparently uncertain degree of access depending on the user IDs assigned on different computers. This leads to apparently absurd variations in experiences, where on some networks, for example a setup with only one user account ever created on each Mac, will be able to share without any permissions tweaks because all accounts will have the same UID (501, no matter what the accounts are named) whereas another network using multiple user accounts per Mac will see problems right away. So some groups will never struggle with this, whereas some others may see problems that develop over time, or problems which appear/disappear spontaneously, depending on when/how additional user accounts are created/used with the shared folder. \nIt's a mystery why Apple has left such a festering usability defect in the configuration of such an otherwise easy to enable file sharing capability.\nOn external disks, this problem is addressed with the \"Ignore permissions on this volume\" option. There may be a similar feature for apple file sharing, but where is it.\nIf you roll you own Samba service config there are other mechanisms for handling these problems, but Samba is not at all easy to use.\n\nA: You can't do this with traditional POSIX-style permissions, but you can with inheritable access control entries.  To allow read+write access for the entire \"staff\" group to everything in /Users/Shared/reallyshared, you'd use:\nsudo chmod -R +a \"staff allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" /Users/Shared/reallyshared\n\nThe file_inherit,directory_inherit part means that this access control entry will automatically be added to new files & folders created inside this folder, but it doesn't automatically apply to items already there (that's why I added the -R flag to chmod -- that applies it to everything currently within the folder), and it won't be applied to items created somewhere else and then moved into this folder (I don't know of a way around this, sorry).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5689", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "39"}}

I still plan to use both Mac and PC.\n\nA: My first instinct is to suggest using IMAP and just keeping all your mail etc on the server. Then it is as simple as using Thunderbird or another Mac compatible mail client up to date with your email accounts.\nHowever, I am assuming you have a reason to not go this route. An alternative would be to use Outlook for Mac if you're familiar with Outlook and wish to keep using it (and are okay with shelling out a little bit of money for it).

{"text": "Q: Save .mov file with applescript I've installed the Perian addon for Quicktime so it can open .flv files, and then I can save them as .m4v or .mov.  I'm trying to make an Applescript to convert from .flv to .m4v automatically by using this tutorial and butchering their example applescript file, which normally converts ChemDraw files (.cdx, .cml, .mol) to .tiff, so that it instead uses Quicktime to save the .flv files as .m4v.  When I try to use it, though, I get an error \"QuickTime Player got an error: document 1 doesn't understand the save message\".  My save message is currently:\n\nsave first document in target_path as \".m4v\"\n\nwhich looks like the QuickTime dictionary's instructions:\n\nsave specifier : The document(s) or window(s) to save.\n[as saveable file format] : The file format to use.\n\nI've also tried \"m4v\", without the period, and still get the error.\nIs my Save direction wrong, or is it probably an error from trying to use Quicktime instead of the original ChemDraw?  I tried to change references to .cdx, .cml, .mol, .tiff, and ChemDraw to .flv, .m4v, and QuickTime respectively, but maybe it's more complicated than that?\nI would, in fact, appreciate any example showing how to save an application file (ex: a TextEdit .rtf or .txt), as I can't seem to get any kind of file to save using applescript.\n\nA: Sorry, still too low to post comment.

(tell blocks can be important, as well as knowing what value type target_path is, etc.)\n\nA: I've only had to script Quicktime once, and that script is long gone, but I do remember that you actually the export command is really what you want if you want to convert formats. From the Dictionary\n\nexport\u2002v : Export a movie to another\n  file; export document : the movie to\n  export; in file : the destination file;\n  using settings preset text : the name\n  of the export settings preset to use\n\nI remember opening a sample file, creating a preset, exporting the file, then using the name of the preset in the final script. But the key was to actually manually create and use the preset first.\nThere are a lot of places to get started with Applescript, but Quicktime is definitely not one of them, and hacking that tutorial isn't going to work without a lot of unnecessary effort. I recommend you further search for Applescript example specific to Quicktime as the API is a bit wonky and really weak in the current version (10.x, I believe), to be honest. I do know that Apple has a complete Quicktime Applescript example code collection buried on their site, but the link is no longer in my notes. Macscripter.net might offer up some practical examples as well.\n\nA: If you're using QuickTime Pro 7, I believe it can only save natively in .mov. You do have the option to export to other formats, but saving is a different function, and is always .mov regardless of the codec used within.\nSee if you can save as .mov with your script. If you can, then you know that you need to change your code to use an export function.

It seems to detect that this is a 3G wifi device rather than a WiFi network and gives me an error message saying I am not allowed to connect to devices of this type.\nI dont know if the iPhone 4 or iPhone 4s will enable you to connect (as they have built in WiFi hotspots in the operating system) but an iPhone 3G with MyWi 5 definitely wont.  Not sure if Android devices will allow you to or not.\nHope that helps folks\n\nA: Tethering isn't allowed for the iPhone or iPad (at least not without jailbreaking it, I believe). At the same time, I have a wifi-only iPad, and I have yet to find myself in a situation where I was 1.) in a public wifi-less area and 2.)

I feel the 3G is a bit of a boondoggle, at least for me.\n\nA: You have to jailbreak the iPhone and install an expensive program called MyWi 4.0 (check spelling) from Cydia.

I'm using VMWare to emulate Ubuntu on my Leopard Mac OS X.\nThe IP address changes everytime I put the Mac to sleep.\nI was wondering if I can avoid that.\n\nA: You can do this -- just configure the Ubuntu virtual machine with a static IP. The choice of IP will depend on the network you're connecting to... You didn't mention if you were using a NAT or Bridged connection, and the choice of IP will different based on that. I can provide specific instructions if you like, but, they'll be all things you do within the Ubuntu VM, not within the Mac environment. (So you may find better luck asking on http://askubuntu.com or https://unix.stackexchange.com/)\nYou could also install the \"avahi-daemon\" package in Ubuntu and then you won't need to remember the VM's IP address, you can use vm-hostname.local as if it were a Mac with Bonjour.\nEDIT: I see you're using a NAT interface. I typed up a long list of instructions only got get stuck on the final step. I'll do more research into this, but in the meantime, here's some instructions which I have not tested, but might work on the Mac side...\nHere's incomplete instructions, I will finish them up shortly:\nVMware Susion starts assigning IPs via DHCP at .128 (at least on my machine). The first three octets of the IPs are defined by a network probe which happened when you installed VMware, so you'll want to determine what network VMware chose for you, and then choose an IP underneath the range VMware assigns via DHCP to avoid conflicts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine what network VMware chose: In the Ubuntu Virtual Machine, choose System > Administration > Network Tools. In the window that appears, under \"Network Device\", choose \"Ethernet Interface (eth0)\". In the list below, look for \"IPv4\". Look at the IP address in the right hand column, and make note of the first three octets (numbers between the dots). On my machine, this is: 172.16.1\n\n*Choose a new static IP: You can make up any number from 2 to 127 which will be appended to the network from step 1, as long as it doesn't conflict with any other static IPs you have assigned. Let's say you choose 15, because I like the number 15. In my example your static IP would then be 172.16.1.15.\n\n*Configure Ubuntu to use a static IP: Go to System > Preferences > Network Connections in the Ubuntu VM.  Under \"Wired\" choose \"Auto eth0\" and click \"edit\". Go to \"IPv4 Settings\" and set \"Method:\" to \"Manual\". Next to \"Addresses\", click the \"Add\" button. In the new row that appears, under \"Address\", enter the IP you close (172.16.1.15 in my example). Under Netmask, enter 255.255.255.0. Under gateway, enter the first three octets of your IP, followed by .1. (In my example, the gateway would be 172.16.1.1). Under DNS Servers, enter... oh, crap, this is being provided by DHCP. Let me figure out a way to make this work :-/\n\nA: To complement on Josh\u2019s post, the answer is yes, but it depends. \nTechnically speaking, any OS inside a VM has direct access to either the network card or a private network created by the host OS. In either case, you can configure your VM to have any IP address you want. \nNow I assume you want to have your VM with the same IP all the time, so you should switch to bridged connection, which will make the VM believe that it has a dedicated network card that you can later configure as you please. In fact, for the rest of the network, the machine will be a regular computer. VMWare will take care of the virtualization and the virtual Network Card (NIC).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5716", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: What's the purpose of the eject button on the MacBook Air? I was interested to see that the power button on the new Airs has been moved to the keyboard, and was anticipating that it would just replace the eject key that has traditionally taken up that position.\nHowever, this appears not to be the case (pic is from iFixit's teardown guide):\n\nWhat's the purpose of the eject key with no optical drive?\n\nA: Well, The keyboard is the same as other Macbooks (which have SuperDrive), but in any case, if you have an external (USB) superdrive, the button will work as advertised. \n\nA: You can use Ejectulate to map the eject key to show you a list of every ejectable volume, making it useful even on a MacBook Air lacking an optical drive.\n\nA: There's also quite a few keyboard shortcuts that use the eject key. \n\n\n*\n\n*Control \u2303+Eject \u23cf brings up a screen that has Restart/Sleep/Cancel/Shut Down options\n\n*Command \u2318+Control \u2303+Eject \u23cf instantly restarts\n\n*(etc.)\n\nA: That's funny.

Because it's made by Apple it doesn't have any buttons on it, including an eject button. Most new/casual Mac users won't know the drag to eject or context-menu eject methods, so in order to make the drive streamlined with the Mac, they put the eject key on the MacBook Air itself.\nI guess Apple anticipates a wide user base for the new Superdrive...\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5736", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "12"}}

{"text": "Q: OS X 10.6: Applications crash when sounds play Most of my applications crash whenever a sound is played -- but not if the machine has been recently rebooted.\nFor example, Mail.app crashes when I send email, because of the whoosh sending sound. Safari/Chrome/Firefox will crash when Flash plays sounds, e.g. with YouTube, but does not crash for silent Flash apps. iChat will crash if I get a video chat request. iTunes will not start at all.\nAll display the same symptom -- freeze with spinning beach ball. All can be force-quit without issue, and without affecting other applications.\nIf I start an app right after a reboot, it generally will run just fine. If I open Safari after a fresh reboot, I can watch Flash video for an hour or two without issue, but the next morning, it will crash again.\nIf I open Skype after a fresh reboot, it will remain open and working, sometimes for days. But if I close it, it will not open again until I reboot.\nI've go through flashing PRAM and repair permissions with the Apple techs, and it doesn't seem to help. Any idea what I might be able to to do to get sound working again? I've been told to reinstall, but I primarily use the machine for work, and I can't take a week to get everything configured again just so I can use iTunes and YouTube.\nWhat is particularly annoying is having to quit Mail.app and restart after each sent email. If there were a way to disable the sent email sound that would be great too.\nThanks!\nCross-posted: http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=12791456\n\nA: Can you open the Console application (in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder) and see if anything is reported up to and during the application hangs?\nAre you actually getting a crash or just a hang? (A crash will display an \"unexpectedly quit\" dialog on its own (creating a .crash file) , whereas a hang will require you to explicitly force the application that's not responding to quit, which will then generate a .hang (\" stopped working because of a problem).\nIf you are actually getting a crash, please post the crash log (as much as you can) or otherwise provide access to it (as they can be somewhat long). If it's a hang, perhaps any output to Console might be more informative than the .hang report.\nYou mention iTunes does not start at all: do you mean it immediately starts to hang when you try to launch it, or does it crash with an unexpectedly quit dialog?\nAlso, try launching Activity Monitor (also in /Applications/Utilities/) and be sure to set the \"Show\" popup menu to All Processes. Check once at launch or on a fresh startup to see if there are any processes highlighted in red. Then when you begin having the problems, check again in Activity Monitor to see if there are any processes shown as not responding; if so, please post the name of them along with any info that's reported to Console.\nMy rough guess of what's happening is that either coreaudiod itself, or another sound/multi-media-related framework or launch-on-demand agent or service that these apps need is not responding, which in turn causes any applications that rely on it to hang as well.  \n\nA: NSGod's advice to look in the Console led me to a whole bunch of errors like this one:\n1/1/11 8:03:31 PM   com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[288]  (0x1002002f0.mach_init.VersionCueCS3monitor[20180]) The following job tried to hijack the service \"ah_serv_trigger.v1:20179\" from this job: 0x103ae66a0.anonymous.Google Chrome He\n\nFrom there, I found someone else complaining about the same problem who fixed it by removing Adobe Version Cue CS3.\nI uninstalled Version Cue using these instructions. I had a different set of files to remove \u2014 not all the ones they listed existed on my Mac, and not all of my related files were on that list.\nI used these commands:\nsudo rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/VersionCueCS3.prefPane/\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Preferences/com.adobe.versioncueCS3.plist\nsudo rm /private/etc/mach_init_per_user.d/com.adobe.versioncueCS3.monitor.plist\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.adobe.versioncueCS3.plist\n\nWithout even rebooting, all my audio problems vanished.\nThanks so much to everyone who gave advice, especially NSGod. Sorry I cannot give upvotes, or hyperlink my links, but I lack the points to do so. Once I have them, I'll come back and upvote.\nUPDATE: Don't do this one, that I earlier had in the list:\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Application\\ Support/Adobe/Adobe\\ Version\\ Cue\\ CS3/\n\nSeems that that one prevented Photoshop from opening some files. I restored it, and Photoshop works fine, and so does audio.\n\nA: It is difficult to say what the problem is. It sounds like you have a done a good job isolating the problem as related to audio. Here are some general things that might help.\n\n\n*\n\n*Genius Bar - Often problems such as this are caused by hardware issues. If it is a standard Mac system, it likely isn't a hardware compatibility or driver issue as is common with Windows. There is a small chance that it is a known hardware problem in which case I would suggest visiting a Genius Bar if you are near an Apple Store. Even if it isn't a known problem, they will likely be able to determine if it is a hardware issue or not.\n\n*Reinstall Mac OS X - If it is not a hardware problem, then it must be something about the operating system, software or configuration that is causing the problem. Unfortunately, with computer systems the easiest answer is to get the system back to a known good state. Generally this means reinstalling the system as has been suggested to you.\n\n*Restore from Time Machine - If this problem is relatively new and you have a Time Machine or Time Capsule, you could try to get your system back to a known good state by restoring to a time when you did not have this problem.\n\n*Back Track - Try to determine what applications or changes you have made to the system that may have caused this problem. Try to undo those changes or uninstall those applications as much as possible. If you have a similar known good system, you can try and compare the audio settings between the machines and look for any differences. Eliminating potential causes and comparing to a known good configuration are two common troubleshooting techniques -- unfortunately, this could require some technical expertise as well as be time consuming.\n\n*Disable Sounds - If you want to just minimise the damage, try disabling as much of the sound effects as possible. Look both in the system preferences and in individual application preferences. For example in Mail, there is a tick box in the Preferences for 'Play sounds for other mail actions'. \nOne last thought, since everything seems to work fine after a fresh reboot, could it a be a problem caused after waking from sleep or hibernate?\n\nA: Sounds like (no pun intended) you've got some corrupt files on your hard disk, in particular CoreAudio libraries. You may have a dying heard disk.\nI would suggest at a minimum backing up your home directory and reinstalling.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5740", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: Is there an Air Video app, but for photos? I was wondering if there is an app for the iPad in order to see photos that are shared in a Windows/Mac folder.\nI went to Australia and took over 12000 photos, now I want to take a close look at all of them without without importing all to iTunes (so it does not fill up space on my iPad).\nSomething that I could check, mark in order to move/copy to a diff folder so I can edit them later.\nFor iPhone there is the WiFi Photo Viewer but I can't find one for iPad.\n\nA: I developed ImageBank for iOS to do exactly this - streams photos from your PC/Mac to your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.  It's universal so it works natively on the iPad, and it even works over 3G.\nThere's a free version too if you want to try it out:\nImageBank Lite\nIt's only US $0.99 to buy or upgrade from the free version.\n\nA: StreamToMe is far better than Air Video in many ways. One prime example is it's ability to remotely view photos. It will work with files stored anywhere or even browse your iPhoto library It also supports audio only files and portrait orientation playback while Air Video does not. It's a universal app that runs on iPhones too and the server app runs on Mac or PC. Price - $2.99.\nThe interface is nicer and there's even a recent history for convenience. It has always perplexed me why AirVideo is more popular.\nAlternatively, there's another great app you may wanna look at when you get some time called HereFileFile. It does not have an iPad optimized version yet, but they are in fact working on one as we speak. It looks very promising. However, the iPhone version is very nice. It's fairly similar in concept to these other two apps, but there are differences which I won't go into here.\n\nA: while it requires a jailbreak, I was really impressed after installing AirServer yesterday - I can run the server on my iPad and use my iPhoto to stream photos over AirPlay - really really awesome when you're not nearby a TV and if you are, you've got the reverse - a mini AppleTV in your pocket with your iPad as a beautiful remote for content!\n\nA: On the link you provide, it is marked as compatible with iPad. What's the issue? Moreover, it seems they're running a christmas sale :)\n\nApart my silly remark above (which clearly deserved votes down. Probably let too many neurons in the end of year festivities... :-/) there is an Air Photo HD app. It seems to be a browser of your iPhoto library over the air. Are you using iPhoto? If so, it could be a solution. Though, from the screenshots, I don't know if you can mark them as accepted/rejected.\nOtherwise, depending on the total size of your photos folder, Dropbox or similar services could be used, as what you'll do on the iPad will then be sync'ed automatically in the cloud (Dropbox free account is 2GB)\n\nA: ImageBank for iPhone/iPad does the trick for me!\n\nA: Not exactly what you were looking for, but if you had the time/bandwidth, you could upload the 12,000 photos to Flickr. Then you would have many more options for viewing/sharing. You could view the photos via Safari on the iPad or download one of the many applications which support viewing a Flickr feed.\nAgain, not ideal. Food for thought.\nGood luck!\n\nA: If you can't find a dedicated app (and it sure seems like something at least 20 people would have implemented by now) you could go old school and use safari and web sharing.\nI have used the export to web page and export to slide show functionality of iPhoto/Aperture to save a html folder to the ~/Sites folder.\nThen it's simple to turn on web sharing and use mobile safari to browse the thumbnail pages or just click through the main images as a slide show. \nYou can also export the slide show and a quicktime movie can be dumped if you would prefer better transitions and full screen with less tapping to navigate.\nI might try out PixelSync next time I need to rate and do heavier editing from the couch or by handing the iPad to a client. Again - this won't be good unless you want your photos in a managed database as it won't work with just a folder of files.\nAnd way out in \"the OP didn't even ask this\" land is a suggestion to check out PhotoMechanic - it stores all images in a folder but is optimized for extremely rapid optimized rating of many photos. There isn't an iPad/iPhoto link, but I've seen professionals blitz through 4.5k photos at the end of a major marathon and cull that first to 500 and then a second pass to the 35 images that make the day's news media picks for press use. With 12k images you might need a great tool on the computer to narrow down things before you move them to iOS land.\n\nA: I'm not quite following the reasoning behind chasing for an iOS app for aide in your sorting process. No matter what app you find, importing to your Mac/PC and using one of many available applications will allow far greater ease and efficiency to go through such a massive bulk of images. Why not import and then sort them in an Aperture library? Your data doesn't get locked in, you can rate, edit, sort, and delete photos, and you can get a 30-day trial.\n\nA: If you've willing to put the photos in iPhoto, we've just released an app that will stream them to your iPad over your home Wi-Fi network: AirPics.\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/airpics/id475202862?mt=8\nIt does not support flagging photos, but is good for streaming large albums (I've tested it with more than 3000 photos in a single album on my iPad 2 without issue).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5743", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}
{"text": "Q: Can I hide the new messages notification in the Mail icon for only one of my email accounts? Basically I would like to have two email accounts setup on my iPhone 4, one my personal account and one for work.\nHowever for the work account, I'd like to not have it's unread message count included in the number of unread messages displayed as a part of the Mail app's icon (the number in the red circle).\nIs this possible to do?\n\nA: No - there's no control for that on iOS 4.3 or less. If you disable that account it will temporarily turn it off on counts but the content stays loaded on the device.\nI will second the suggestion to set up a separate folder to store the majority of the unread messages and use server side filtering or a manual process to get rid of the distracting/offending messages. \nMy phone and sanity are both better once I bit the bullet and set up a rule that says if it's unread over a week it goes into my triage later folder. I can still search for messages using spotlight, they are all where I can find them but my phone is faster and the badge is more meaningful without that pile of messages.\nI'm not quite to inbox zero, but this was a good first step for me to getting there.\n\nA: You can effectively turn off push notifications for a particular email account... sort of. Go to the Settings app, and hit \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\". Go to \"Fetch New Data\", then scroll down and go to \"Advanced\". For the email account whose little red badges you don't want, change the setting to \"Manual\" instead of \"Push\". \nThis will prevent new messages from pushing a notification icon to the home screen. However, when you open the Mail app to check your other email, the app will sync the \"Manual\" account with the server and you'll get a badge if there are unread messages there. So, like bmike mentioned, the real way to get rid of those badges is to get closer to inbox zero. \n\nA: There's probably no \"set this option\" way to do it, but I've noticed that a.) the unread count is the number of unread messages in your inbox, not in subfolders and b.) iOS does not automatically check subfolders for new messages unless those subfolders are set to push via Exchange.  So, if your work account is an Exchange account:\n-Make a subfolder in your Inbox\n-Create a server-side rule to move all messages to that folder.  This can be done in Outlook on your work computer (assuming it's a PC) or probably in the Exchange web client (possibly requiring IE, since they disable certain functionality in the web client for other browsers...).\nThen you still have access to the messages in the work account (+1 tap, but it's an iPhone 4, so it's snappy), and they won't show up in your unread count.\n\nA: Sorry but you are all wrong... there is a way... I've spent the past several hours searching google for a forum for someone who knows... the reason why I know is because someone showed me once... I then reset my phone and the setting was reset and I've been trying for the past several days to remember how I did it.. yes IOS 7 and yes I did it... All I remember was that it wasn't very intuitive so hence why I've now forgotton... if I find it I will repost.. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5747", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}
{"text": "Q: What is the difference between a \"sparse disk image\" and a \"sparse bundle disk image\"? What are the differences between sparse and sparse bundle disk images?\n\nA: From the DropDMG manual:\n\nSparse\n  bundle disk images appear as a single\n  file but are actually stored as a\n  folder with many files inside. This\n  makes it more efficient to back them\n  up using Time Machine or other backup\n  utilities, as only the changed parts\n  need to be copied. Additionally,\n  sparse bundle disk images work well\n  with the Compact Image\u2026 command.\n  Compatible with Mac OS X 10.5 and\n  later.\nSparse\n  disk images are stored as a single\n  file. This can make backups\n  inefficient for large disk images,\n  because the entire file must be copied\n  each time. The Compact Image\u2026 command\n  generally does not reclaim as much\n  disk space as with sparse bundle disk\n  images. Compatible with Mac OS X 10.3\n  and later.\n\n\nA: Sparse bundle disk image is an optimized form of the sparse disk image. It optimizes intentionally to reduce network load upon backup of changes to the filesystem at the expense of time and space. Specifically it uses a hashing function to store bits of data across a large directory structure which allows changes to be isolated in smaller band files. When copying the disk image elsewhere, rsync like tools will only need to copy the bands that change which makes incremental copies or backups far faster than moving the entire sparse image.\nLocal storage of the bundle img is less efficient in terms of space used, CPU time needed to process IO to the disk image is increased and when files are deleted, the reclamation of space is delayed and not as complete when compared to a sparse disk image. \nUnless you are backing up the bands incrementally online (as Time Machine does to Time Capsule) it's usually better to go with the sparse disk image over a sparse bundle. Some software will look inside a sparse image and only copy the changed blocks, but the bundle allows simpler tools to be more efficient moving changes around.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5751", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "51"}}

I believe iWeb just publishes static pages and doesn't support dynamic content. In that case you will probably need to resort to using JavaScript so that the redirect is performed client side.\nBe careful when using this approach though as it has the potential to create a poor user experience. It would be best to establish a way to allow the user to view the page if they really want to.

It's very simple to install (essentially get it on Mac App Store), doesn't require a web server or any other service / daemon / dependent software, it does autodiscovery of all interfaces on a supported network device / server and it lets you simultaneously graph traffic from multiple interfaces and multiple devices. It supports SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, and in the latter case, both 32-bit and 64-bit counters. \nThere is also a free, good alternative, although it is command line only - it might fit your needs though. It's called ttg - you'll need to open this page and scroll down till you find it, or download the source from here: ttg.c. This one has been written by a good friend of mine. \nI hope this is useful. I've been genuinely trying to help here and not promote my app. \n\nA: I'm using SNMP software from Oidview. I am not sure if they have it for your linux machine but at least you can test it and see if thats what you want.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5765", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

{"text": "Q: Can I customize ANSI colors in Terminal without extra tools like SIMBL? I noticed that colors in the Snow Leopard Terminal.app aren't that great (using the Pro theme, but the other themes are worse).\nThere seems to be no easy way to customize the colors, and googling only showed weird workarounds involving SIMBL and forcing the terminal to 32-Bit.\nIs that still the case, or is there a way to change the colors in Snow Leopard's Terminal.app? My shell is zsh, not bash if that makes a difference.\nClarification: I'm referring to the ANSI Colors like Green, Red, Blue etc. By default, the Terminal looks like this:\n\nThese colors aren't that great, I want them look like this:\n\nI have found a 64-Bit compatible SIMBL/TerminalColours plugin, but if I can avoid having to use SIMBL, that would be my goal. I know that there are alternative terminals like iTerm, but I want Terminal.app.\n\nA: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, the sixteen ANSI colors are customizable in Terminal preferences.\n\nTerminal > Preferences > Settings > [profile] > Text > ANSI Colors\n\n\nWhen you point at one of the color controls it displays the ANSI color name and number for reference.\nWhen you edit an ANSI color there's a button in the color panel for resetting the individual ANSI color back to its default:\n\nA couple of tips about the Settings preference panel:\n\n\n*\n\n*As with most of the Settings, you can select more than one profile at a time (e.g., Shift- or Command-Click, or choose Edit > Select All) and change the colors for all of them at the same time.\n\n*The Settings preference panel supports Undo (and Redo), so you can try out a change (or several changes) and revert changes you don't like.\n\nA: Terminal.app has these colors hard-coded into it. Internal methods like +[NSColor(Terminal) vtRedColor] use hard-coded floating-point constants to set the colors.\nAs you noted, there are SIMBL plugins that can patch this but you've already noted their current limitations. SIMBL has been updated to support 64-bit applications, so you should contact the authors of the plugins to request that they rebuild them to support 64-bit. There's also another SIMBL plugin to consider.\nThe only other option for Terminal.app is to write a feature request at http://bugreport.apple.com and hope that somebody at Apple is enticed to add color customization to Terminal.app for Lion.\n\nA: ANSI escape codes might do what you want. They're not as popular now as they were when everyone worked at a terminal over a modem, but they're still work in Terminal and iTerm and such ilk. I wouldn't be surprised to find that Terminal is using them behind the scenes to control its colors.\nYou might want to look at IBM's Prompt magic page. ANSI codes should allow you to customize the colors if you start with the Basic terminal profile.\nWikipedia has additional info at ANSI escape code.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5772", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "12"}}

It sounds to me like a dead hard drive. That's relatively simple to fix. If you have backups, you'll be fine. See what the test says and let us know the results. We can advise over where to go for service / how to go about a DIY repair. If it is the disk (I'm 80% sure), it's quite easy to do yourself (and not too pricey).

{"text": "Q: Should I use time machine to migrate from one mac to another? I have had my blackbook for a little over 4 years now and think it's time to upgrade to a new macbook pro. I'm currently running leopard on the blackbook with time machine. I'm wondering if time machine is the right way to move my data from my old mac to the new one.\nMy main concern is that if I do a full restore, I will lose the new software on my new mac (e.g. - Aperture). I basically want to migrate all of my music (from itunes), a bunch of files/projects, photos (I don't use iPhoto), etc. I probably don't care as much about applications.\nWhat's the most painless way of doing this?\nNOTE: I would like to be able to use my time machine harddrive with the new computer for the same purpose.\n(Extra credit if anyone can comment on migrating Eclipse workspaces. I'm pretty sure just moving all the directories over will work fine if I just reinstall Eclipse on the new machine.)\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The best way to do this is with Apple's Migration Assistant. Plug the Macs into each other with an ethernet cable and launch Migration Assistant on both. Follow the instructions on screen.\nI've migrated to new machines seven times and it's a pretty flawless system. Based on other answers I'm pretty sure that Eclipse won't really know the difference after migration as long as your short name on both Macs is the same.\n\nA: I wouldn't recommend a full restore, assuming it's even possible (Apple can sometimes be a bit funky about system releases on new machines). What you should do is a home directory migration, which I believe you can do from your time machine backup with Migration Assistant when you set up the new machine.\nWhat you want to be careful to do to be as seamless as possible is make sure your new user account has the same shortname as your existing one. That should clear up any snafus you might have with migrating Eclipse as well (I think I saw a related issue for Eclipse on Super User that suggested this.)\n\nA: For eclipse workspace, migrating the workspace folder will be OK (if you have all your source files inside the folder). At first launch, Eclipse will ask you to set the workspace folder. You'll give this folder and your projects will be there.  If you have the source files elsewhere, you will have to copy them and keep the same folders structure for Eclipse to find the files.\nFor the Time Machine Disk. You will be able to use the same one. Another folder will be created to store the backup of your new laptop as there is noe different folder per physical machine. So no worry on this side.\nFor the rest of your files, it will be on a case by case as you just want to migrate a part of it. As said already, you can migrate your home directory with the Migration Assistant (in Applications/Utilities).  As for the main part of Apple applications, if the files are managed in the library, an export/import of the library will be fine. If not, you'll have to do the file copy by yourself. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5820", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: What's a good IE tester for Macs? I just moved to the Mac after years and permanently moved my PC out of my life at home. I am a graphic designer who builds web pages. I code pure XHTML pages with div layouts. But whenever you keep to web standards, you have to check out how it works on the most commonly-used browsers.\nOn the Mac, my default browser is Firefox (Chrome and Safari are also installed). But I cannot see the result of how my pages look in IE.\nOn a Mac, is there any way to test web designs on IE?\n(IE for Mac is not supported by Microsoft any more, so I didn't download it. I've received several suggestions to use Boot Camp, but I don't want to install Windows.)\n\nA: If running a virtual machine isn't interesting, I think your best bet is to get a cheap PC with a Microsoft OS.\nYou can run it without a monitor and connect to it using Microsoft's free \"Remote Desktop Connection\" software so you don't have to physically type on a different machine to test things. There are a few different versions of IE you may wish to test. Microsoft has virtual-machine-based copies of their browsers for this purpose [1]. These images can't be run in a traditional VM on your Mac due to licensing problems. They will run on the cheap PC.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=21EABB90-958F-4B64-B5F1-73D0A413C8EF&displaylang=en\n\nA: I understand you don't want to install Windows. However, thats what all Mac-users at our company do (with vmWare fusion).\n\nA: The most common ways I know of doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Virtual testing:\n\n*\n\n*BrowserCam\nScreen capture and Remote Access service for cross platform compatibility testing and HTML design quality assurance\n\n*Adobe BrowserLab\n\n*Browsershots\nCheck Browser Compatibility, Cross Platform Browser Test\n\n\n*Your local library often has PCs available for patrons to use\n\n*Ask a buddy to test it/take screenshots for you (often, in return for you doing the same for them on the Mac)\nEven if you had IE/Mac installed, it wouldn't help you any in this regard. It used a different rendering engine; one that no version of IE/Win has ever used.\n\nA: There is a Way to use the regular IE7 and IE8 for Windows via Wine. A short German tutorial is available at http://www.webmasterpro.de/coding/article/internet-explorer-auf-mac-os-x-installieren.html.\n\nA: I've been using http://ipinfo.info/netrenderer/index.php and it works well, though obviously not as good as vmWare. If I was working with webpages just a bit more often I would probably invest in a virtual windows-machine.\n\nA: I would suggest a virtual environment so that you can clone your virtual machine to host different versions of IE on every virtual machine (at least IE version 7 and 8 need to be tested and version 9 is about to be released).\nBeside the commercial offering (VMWare Fusion and Parallels) there are also open source projects like Virtual Box that you can use to start experimenting.\nYou'll need a valid Microsoft Windows XP or Windows 7 license so that you can install Windows on the virtual machine.\nRegards\nMassimo\n\nA: You don't. No IE-testing suite is completely accurate, and several will raise errors which don't appear in production (wasting your time on false positives). Virtual machines aren't as reliable as people think - I've seen several VM-specific bugs whilst trying to run IE6 (I think IE6's rendering engine relies on the coordination of certain threads, which VMs can't quite manage properly).\nIf IE6/7 functionality matters to your organization, I\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5841", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}

Is there a way to make them open side by side from top left to bottom right?\n\nA: This behavior won't happen in OS X by default, but a whole bunch of 3rd party window-arranging apps ought to be able to help:\n\n\n*\n\n*SizeUp http://irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/\n\n*Divvy http://mizage.com/divvy/\n\n*Breeze http://www.autumnapps.com/breeze/\n\n*ShiftIt http://code.google.com/p/shiftit/\n\n*Mercury Mover http://www.heliumfoot.com/mercurymover/details\n\n*Optimal Layout http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout/\n\n*Cinch http://irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/\n\nA: You could also check out iTerm 2. One of the nice features it has is the ability to split panes, each one of which shows a different session. You can slice vertically and horizontally and create any number of panes in any imaginable arrangement. It also offers a number of other improvements over Terminal.app.\n\nA: Try using the tabs feature. When you're in a Terminal window, press Cmd+T and a new tab will open up alongside your current one, just like in Safari. You can even rename the tabs by double clicking the tab header, and assigning a title. Hope this helps.\n\nA: There is not going to be a way to accomplish this out-of-the-box, you will have to have some sort of third party window management utility. There very well may be one that works automatically, but I haven't quite found one yet :).\nMy two recommendations (in this order only because I've used Divvy, not SizeUp) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Divvy - $14, Divvy is a very sleek little utility. On it's face, the use case is to have the application window open and active that you wish to resize, then call up Divvy either by clicking it's icon in the menu bar, or hitting a defined activation shortcut, which calls up a 6x6 grid on all active screens (multi-monitor aware!) which you can drag a cutout on to move+resize your application window.\n\n\nYour use case would likely involve creating a global shortcut to define a 1/2 left and a 1/2 right cutout on the primary screen. You can then click the terminal you want, press this series of shortcut keys, et vo\u00edla, 1/2 width slots for your terminal windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*SizeUp - $7, SizeUp will likely be quicker to start for you if all you ever want is the 1/2 left 1/2 right capability. It already has predefined shortcuts for halfs, corners, and moving windows around Screens and Spaces, but that is (to the best of my knowledge) where the functionality ends.\n\n\nCheck them out, decide what you want, maybe do a little more research to see if something else exists.\nI seem to recall seeing a question on this site regarding the Windows 7 feature of Window snapping. Drag a window to the top of the screen to maximize it, left to 1/2 left it, right to 1/2 right it, but again my term selection seems to be... inefficient. That and window shopping for price is always in your best interest.\n\nA: Apart from the tools already mentioned above, there is BetterTouchTool, a very nice utility that allows custom finger tap gestures on a Magic Mouse or any multitouch trackpad. I have configured it to make windows snap to the left or right half of the screen by simply using a two-finger hold-and-tap gesture.

It is very drag and drop friendly and pastes the URL to your clipboard for convenience.\nSkitch is a little more heavy on the screen snapping controls. It's like grab on steroids. You can quickly hide private information, point out items, and edit the snap before uploading.\nThe free version of both are well worth it. Both have paid upgrades that are low cost, but you don't need to pay to use either. I have also heard really good things about Droplr so you might check it out as well.\n\nBoth CloudApp and Skitch are available on the App Store. The two are better together - skitch is better for grabbing a great screen shot, and droplr for upload and sharing it.\n\nA: Dropshare is another paid option that has come along - in the vein of TinyGrab and LittleSnaper (which Realmac has replaced with Ember) mentioned already.\nBoth the OS X and iOS version can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upload to S3, Rackspace or your own server (via SCP over SSH)\n\n*Global hotkeys for uploading clipboard, screenshot/recording or note (MarkDown supported)\n\n*Create optional, custom landing pages for your files\n\n*Sync connections/preferences via Dropshare's own sync service\n\n*Shorten URLs using services or custom shorteners\n\n*Delete previously shared files directly via the app\n\n\nThree-day trial of the OS X version's available at their site.\n\nI've been pleased using it for the past few months.\n\nA: I wrote a small python script to do that.\nIt will not just auto upload screenshots to imgur but also copy screenshot url to clipboard and open up browser with link instantly.\nCheck it out:\nVideo Demo:\nLink\n\nA: LittleSnapper is designed to work with FTP and copy the URL after upload.

{"text": "Q: Can I have multiple mice & keyboards for one Mac? I would like to control two cursors with two mice in the same time, as well as have two keyboards for separate control and text input.\nMy goal is to have two users on one computer, so I can let my brother to play/chat anything while I do my job. If we have two monitors, then I don't need to buy a new computer.\nIf you know of some software that can do this, please let me know.\n\nA: You can achieve something very close to this with a virtual PC solution. I tried it with Parallels. For simplicity I'll assume you run Mac OS X on the \"real\" computer and Windows in Parallels (of course you can run another OS too, I just picked one to keep the story simple).\nIn the Parallels settings, you can choose which USB devices should be connected to the Mac and which to Windows. If you connect your external keyboard and mouse to Windows, you get a warning that this will disable input from them on the Mac, but this is exactly what you want. Be sure to disable mouse pointer synchronization (in version 5 it's called \"SmartMouse\"), otherwise you won't see the Windows mouse pointer.\nNow you can use the external keyboard and mouse only in Windows, and the main keyboard and mouse anywhere. This is also useful if you want to override something your brother is doing :-)\nDoing this in a Mac only environment is currently not possible because it would require changes in the window manager, which is part of the OS. There is a project that does this for the X window manager, but this will not work to control every window on your Mac. TeamPlayer is software that allows you to control Windows with multiple mice, but with the exception of their own programs, you control the computer in turns: only one mouse can give real clicks, the others must wait for their turn.\nA complete solution is Userful, but this runs only on Linux, because, as I said, it requires modifications at different places in the software stack and only Linux is open enough to allow this. Microsoft created a similar project: Windows MultiPoint Server, but this is targets to schools and I doubt you can get it. And of course, it only runs on Windows.\n\nA: Actually, its not that simple.\nThe calls software makes into the operating system assumes up to one keyboard and up to one mouse. Anything more would require the software know how to tell the difference between them.\nI have heard of 'virtual' solutions for Windows that allow a PC to have its resources divided up to two sets of keyboard, mouse and monitor. I am unaware of such a solution for the Mac however.\nIf such software existed, I would still be wary of using it. The performance burden of two users at once may be worse than you would tolerate, especially if one is play a game and/or playing music as is implied in the question. In addition its cost, whether it be in the time to setup and maintain this two-headed machine or the funds to acquire software capable of this task, may be more than simply buying another computer.\n\nA: macOS has screen sharing and can make two user accounts in system preferences. One for each of you.\nAttach the second keyboard, mouse, display to an iPhone or iPad or raspberry pi or other low cost computer you own and when the second account connects, you will be asked if you want to share the same screen with your brother or start a second distinct virtual-only session.\nI believe 10.7 OS X Lion was the first OS to support this.\nEnjoy!\n\nA: In a nutshell, this is not possible. User interaction with the Mac OS is assumed to be single user. Two input devices will function simultaneously, but you cannot render two cursors or have them function in parallel. The only way to have two users on one Mac is to provide accounts via netboot, which still requires separate hardware.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5874", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

This makes it so that a thief needs a password to boot to another disk (or do anything other than a normal boot). This means that they can't reset your password from the OS disc and get in anyway. This is an important security measure to take. The only problem is that you can't do things like safe boots and verbose mode. Here is an article about how to set up the OF password (and how to reset a user password).\nAnd here is a general article about physical and virtual options to increase security (ways to help locate a stolen Mac, make thieves think it's broken, or even just lock it to your desk).\n\nA: Considering the other answers, and the possibility of not getting a laptop back, perhaps you need to consider using time machine for a backup, and put the target NAS somewhere not close to the laptop - like in a discrete cupboard with good wi-fi coverage, or a wired ethernet port. You should do this anyway - for the dozen other reasons that the data on one hard drive may become irretrievable.\nThat way, you can have reasonable drive encryption, as even with the OF password, it does not prevent them removing the drive and using it in another machine to retrieve interesting contents.

{"text": "Q: Can the Lagom.nl \"Inversion / Pixel Walk\" screen test truly indicate a problem on a 13\" MacBook Air? My 13\" MacBook Air (late-2010 model) shows strong flicker on some of the following \"Inversion / Pixel Walk\" test images from the LCD test on the site \"lagom.nl\". Does that truly indicate a quality problem with the screen (as the test says), or is it a normal side effect from the screen technology that any 13\" MacBook Air would suffer from?\nI do notice that when scrolling say a web page or Pages document, the image noticeably flickers while scrolling. This might be due to the problem this test is supposed to detect, but I'm not sure. Web pages with a striped background where the stripes are just 1 pixel high also show annoying flicker (even when not scrolling).\nThe test images: http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/inversion.php#inversion-all.png\nAt full screen brightness on my 13\" Air, I can see strong flickering on test image 3. Some of the other images show some slight flickering too, but 3 is particularly strong. By \"strong\" I mean that the flicker is clearly visible even from over 1.5 meters away from the screen (and yes I measured that).\nI had a chance to test it out on two store models of the 13\" MacBook Air and couldn't see any strong flicker, but I did forget to turn up the screen brightness so I'm not sure. Neither my 20\" Cinema Display nor some MacBook (Pro) and PowerBook screens I tested showed any strong flicker. But note that the Air's screen has a higher pixel density, could that affect this test?\nAnd if it's a quality problem, is it something I should / can demand Apple to fix or replace? (I still have a few days of return period left; it might just be a minor nuisance, but do I have to put up with that considering the price of the machine? ...)\n\nA: Every Mac I've ever owned does this same thing. Don't demand a replacement. \nAs an aside, monitor flicker is sometimes noticeable because the 60Hz refresh rate is the same frequency as house electrical current. This causes your lights to blink at that rate. This is usually imperceptible, but can be noticeable with a monitor if they get synced up. This is more common with CRTs, but not unheard of with an LCD.\nDon't worry yourself over this. Did you notice problems with your display before the test?\n\nA: The flicker is caused by the technology (TN) used in your MBA. It's noticeable when brightness is high and under some of the tests. I have 13\" MBP 2010 and I can register flicker on 2a and 4a tests when brightness is above 50%.\nUsually under normal use this shouldn't be noticeable.\n\nA: As noted by others, the amount of pixel walk varies from screen to screen, even in the same model. My experience is that this has nothing to do with it being a TN panel as IPS screens get pixel walk, too.  \nIf it is noticeable on solid colors, I would consider it defective. Especially if you have one display that is noticeably (i.e. your non-technical uncle or other disinterested party would agree that one of the several identical models was \"off\" upon a casual demonstration of normal use. Basically, a one minute test with identical web browsers up - ask the \"helper\" if they all look the same when scrolling). When something is made that different than another model, seeking an exchange from the manufacturer seems like a reasonable request.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5882", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

However, when I am away from home I archive my images straight to the external hard drive.\nI would like to be able to keep these devices in sync to ensure that al images are on both drives.\nLooking at the \"Favourite Mac software\" question, I saw Carbon Copy Cloner mentioned, which unfortunately only works with HFS+ formatted drives, so I can rule that out.

{"text": "Q: Can spyware affect the iPad? I tried to login to my gmail, hotmail, and facebook accounts today. I could not login to those three because they said that my password is incorrect. So I tried to think what I did yesterday. I only used those three websites on my iPad.\nOne thing I noticed with iPad's safari is that it does not warn me for suspicious websites like Chrome or Firefox do.\nI concluded that either someone hacked my facebook account and found primary email accounts from facebook and hacked my emails (since they all use same passwords) or my iPad has been hacked. Is it possible that my iPad was hacked?\n\nA: Don't be so quick to jump to conclusions, there are other possible attack vectors. iOS Safari is one of the most secure browsers because of the sandbox design of iOS.\nFirst and foremost, do you use the same password for all three? Password reuse is a dangerous problem, because if one account is compromised an attacker can try that same password on other websites to see if you have the same password there.\nSecondly, how complex is your password? If it's a word (or combination of words) from the dictionary, attackers can run automated login attempts to guess short passwords. If your password is short and only contains words then it's much easily guessed using this method.\nThirdly, there's no guarantee that the passwords were compromised in the last 24 hours, it could have happened in the past week.\nIn any case, change those passwords soon and promptly, make sure they all have different passwords, and try to use numbers, symbols, or uppercase letters to prevent a dictionary attack. Also don't use common tricks like \"password1\" or \"abc123\" or \"blink182\" because attackers keep common passwords like that on file for dictionary attacks.\n\nA: To date, there has never been a spyware issue on any iPad. Apple's OSes are generally highly secure; even the desktop OS has few such issues.\nSo, rest assured your iPad is highly secure, much more so than any Android tablet.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5895", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

I like how it randomly comes up with new songs to put on there (and yes I'm aware of the \"random\"ness of iPods ;) )\nDo I have any options?\n\nA: Unfortunately no, the automatic filling takes place during sync, and only gets changed in size if you add/remove things that will also take place during sync.\nIf you want to limit it while also preserving some of that randomness, try creating a Smart Playlist that will select songs at random, and then tweak the \"Limit to\" feature until you have enough space free.

It's getting pretty annoying with the Apple ones, though.\nShort of deleting my Apple account altogether, is there any way to stop this?\n\nA: If you're getting these, it might mean someone is trying to hack into your Apple account.

I don't assume the emails come with an IP of the computer sending the request? Maybe you could contact Apple and see if someone on an outside IP is trying to access your stuff.\n\nA: You can stop getting these emails by switching your account to two-step authentication now that iCloud and Apple ID support that. Do keep in mind, that if you receive that email, someone (or some bot / computer script) is telling Apple to begin the reset procedure for your account and if they happen to have compromised any step in the email chain between you and Apple - they can take control of your account.\nYou'll no longer have security questions to ask and Apple will never allow the password to be reset via emails from iForgot.apple.com.

{"text": "Q: What are the advantages of Time Capsule over Airport Extreme with an external hard drive? I would like for someone to outline the differences between buying a time capsule vs. just getting an airport extreme and attaching an external harddrive. The latter seems more flexible (easy to change external harddrive) and even cheaper, yet people are getting time capsules.\nWhat are the pros and cons.\nThanks.\nUPDATE\nCould you please elaborate on:\n\n\n*\n\n*How easy is it to setup with an airport extreme. (Apple explicitly mentions you can add a harddrive to airport extreme, but doesn't say anything about time machine. Is there anything more to it?)\n\n*What are my options if the Time Capsule harddrive fails and/or I need more storage later.\n\n*What are the differences in the router capabilities, e.g. - number of ports, number of supported users, usb jacks, etc.\n\n\nA: As above the Time Capsule is the easy solution.\nI can only really comment on your second point, I bought one about 3 years ago and 18 months ago the hard drive failed, it seemed to be a known problem as Apple replaced the Time Capsule free of charge even though it was outside of the warranty period. What could not be replaced however was the 18 months of backups as Apple would not have replaced the Time Capsule had I opened it up to get a the drive and try to recover the data. So after that experience I won't be buying another Time Capsule.\nIf you are not particularly after a router there are now other companies that offer Time Machine compatible network storage, which may be worth looking at.\n\nA: If you are considering alternative solutions to a Time Capsule, and since you seem particularly worried about hard drive failure and future expandability, you might consider getting a Drobo. It's a storage system that spreads your data over multiple drives, allowing you to hot-swap drives when one fails or you want more storage. The company has an article on their page titled \"Drobo Complements Time Machine function of Mac Leopard OS X\". However, note that this is a storage solution only, it doesn't provide wireless network connectivity. There's a Drobo model that can connect to a network via Ethernet which in turn you could connect to an Ethernet+Wireless router, but I am not sure whether using it that way is compatible with Time Machine. Also, this is far from cheap. But given your concerns over hard drive failure and future expandability, you may want to check it out further.\n(I originally wanted to post this as a comment on LC1983's answer and Tom's follow-up comment, but because I don't have enough reputation to post it as a comment I tried my best to turn this into a \"potential\" answer to the question. My apologies for not fully answering the question though.)\n\nA: Note that according to the following page, it is possible to set up an AirPort Extreme for use with Time Machine but it's not recommended:\nhttp://web.me.com/pondini/Time_Machine/Airport.html\nThe same site nevertheless also still provides instructions on how to set it up. I'll post the link in a comment below (due to lack of reputation points I can only include one link in my answer).

I actually took many hours this morning to find out how to do it, but I want to see alternatives to it.\nI got my iPhone in sync with my iTunes at home, my first machine. I could \"just\" bring the app folder/file back home and sync through that. It works just fine.\nThe question here is on alternatives to that. Jailbreak or not, how could we do it on a second machine?\nedit: I mean to install an actual file like application.app or application.ipa just like they are on the Mobile Applications folder or on iPhone's own /Applications one.\n\nA: For most users, the headache free method is preserving the iTunes folder in its entirety and bringing it over to the other computer. You would then sign into the account you obtain the app with on that computer, and authorize it.\nIf you're simply without the first computer and want to get the app back, then you would simply re-download from the App Store for free (assuming it hasn't been removed).\n\nA: I seem to remember this question being asked before, but the link eludes me at this moment. \nIn short, you can't. iPhone syncing is on a per iTunes-installation basis. Plugging the phone into a different machine and trying to sync will result in iTunes asking if you want to wipe the data and re-sync from the new iTunes repository.\n\nA: It's quite simple if you have iOS SDK installed. I've found the solution in the first place I should have looked for, because I actually generated the app file using Corona. But I suppose this is irrelevant to the question.\nOpen Xcode Organizer, plug in the iDevice and drag n' drop the app into \"applications\". That's it.\nNow, if you don't have iOS SDK, I highly recommend against installing it just for this. It's almost 5GB of downloading. This is why I'd like to know of alternatives.\nedit: I believe the best way is using the iPhone Configuration Utility, yet again like that guide from corona. I've confirmed it works just like using the Organizer, but it doesn't need the Xcode. Just download it (this needs a free login, or find another place on the web with that file, v3.2 is about 10Mb), and drag the app / ipa inside your phone.

{"text": "Q: iTunes: What is the usefulness of checked/unchecked songs? I know the functional effect of unchecking a song: it doesn't play (except when explicitly double-clicked) and doesn't sync with an iPod/iPad. But how is this useful? Does Apple officially recommend any sort of usage of the checkboxes? Or, more subjectively, do you make use of the checkboxes in iTunes, and if so, what songs do you check or uncheck and why?\n\nA: It keeps holiday music out of my playlists, off my iPhone, until I want to overdose on them from December 24th through 25th every year.\nFor that alone: I love the check box.\n\nA: I think you sort of answered your own question as far as \"usefulness\" of the feature.  \nAs far as a use case I would use the check boxes more when I had a larger capacity iPod that could fit my entire music library.  The songs I would uncheck would be skits on hip-hop/rap albums and I have a few theme songs from movies or tv shows I would also uncheck.  I would then select the \"Only sync checked songs\" option in iTunes so I would only have to plug my iPod in and it would automatically sync my library except for those that were unchecked.\n\nA: I uncheck tracks that contain dialogues, like the Pulp Fiction OST, interviews in Beatles at BBC, or an interview at the end of the Aqualung 25th Anniversary.\n\nA: There are a few good case scenarios here to show why they exist. One for myself is that I have a lot of lectures in my iTunes library, but do not want to listen to them regularly. Unchecking them will ensure they neither sync to a device, or play unless I selectively choose to play it.\n\nA: Almost all the answers so far seem to be things where a smart playlist might be a better solution\u2026 but given that, here's mine:\nThere are a lot of bands that have one great album and a few hit-or-miss albums. For them, I buy the good album + the greatest hits.\nBut that leaves me with duplicated songs. Yes, they're really good songs, true, but they're still dupes. Those, I check off so they only show up once.\n\nA: They can be used to solve the dreaded \"remove all files with exclamation marks\" problem.\nSee https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/35813/646\n\nA: Some DJ dance compilations add, in addition to all tracks, a mixed version of the album as a single 1-hour-length track. (As the last track in the album).\nIt's very useful for this scenario.\n\nA: I typically don't uncheck tracks, but when I do, it's typically because I've ripped an entire CD, and there are tracks that I don't think I will want to hear, except on rare occasions.  If I wasn't completely pedantic about having everything I own in my library, I'd probably just delete those tracks, but I don't want to have to dig the CD out of a box and re-rip it, should I change my mind in the future.\nI think most other uses are better supported using smart playlists.  IMO, checkboxes became mostly pointless after Apple introduced smart playlists.\n\nA: In my case, I've added an audiobook to my iTunes to listen to on my iPhone while I'm out of the house and want to, but can't, read my book. (I get carsick while reading, etc.) However, it's 20 discs long and averages 20 tracks per disc. I want to keep it in my iTunes because I spent quite a bit of time adding all of these discs and adding information, but I also don't want to have it popping up with my music randomly! Also, I don't want to bloat my poor phone with the entire thing. So I sync like four discs at a time, and uncheck the ones I've already listened to and ones I don't want on my phone yet!\n\nA: I have a lot of duplicate songs - the same song by the same artist, from different CDs. I compare them and uncheck the one that is not as good quality as the other.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5937", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "17"}}

Famously one of the ugliest Mac apps ever created (although it's much nicer looking now), Calibre is an e-book manager.

The PDFs will have a spiral bound edge and the ePubs have either a brown generic cover, the cover art included in the download or the cover art you added via \"Get Info\"-\"Artwork\".

I would like to be able to either navigate from a calendar event to its location within maps, or view all upcoming events on a map.

The location field of an event does not recognise an address, no matter how perfectly you enter it.\n[UPDATE] In iOS 5, the location field in any calendar event will (if properly formatted) hyperlink to the Maps app.\n\nA: It wouldn't be a perfect solution, but you could try pasting in a maps.google.com link into you calendar events.\nFor example:\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Infinite+Loop+1,+Cupertino,+CA,+United+States&sll=37.331693,-122.030764&sspn=0.007311,0.009871&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=1+Infinite+Loop,+Cupertino,+Santa+Clara,+California+95014&ll=37.331906,-122.031262&spn=0.007311,0.009871&z=17\nIf you open this link on an iPad it should take you to the Maps application.\nBut you would have to do this manually on a computer for each event.\n\nA: There are several apps that have this featured into them.

What reputable stores exist for purchasing RAM for a Mac?\n\nA: Macs and PCs use the same type of RAM just like they use the same type of Hard Drives, if you buy RAM directly from Apple it is definitely marked up.  I have personally had good experiences with Kingston. Other popular 3rd party suppliers are  New Egg, Tiger Direct, and Crucial.\n\nA: Personally I go with OWC.

Their prices are good, shipping is excellent and their web site is optimized for eliminating mistakes in ordering the incorrect memory. \nI find their site to be the best reference on the web for rapidly finding the memory needs for any Mac bar none - even Apple's on-line documentation pales in comparison to RamJet for memory specifications or planning an upgrade.\nThey use pictures of the products and have very good descriptions to figure out exactly what mac you own. I've made perhaps 8 purchases from them and shipping, returns and customer support are top notch. I do regret buying from one of the \"cheapest\" vendors linked above when the product they sold didn't work and they charged me incorrectly for the return / exchange. It eventually got sorted, but I'll never get back the time and effort to clear up their mistakes on that one order.\nDo your homework on what happens if you need support down the road and know the time periods for returns / warranty / support if you care. I'm more value sensitive than price sensitive but RamJet is generally very competitive on price as well. I'd also put Crucial and OWC in the tried and true category, but I've never seen a time when their prices were lower enough for me to not spend my time and $$ with RamJet.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5994", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

What this means in plain english is you might end up with each copy of the file taking up space - rapidly filling the drive.\nTime Machine uses great care to only store each file once - and only takes up more space when the file changes. It assumes everything already stored is correct and won't go back and \"fix\" any errors you make.

Just connect all the drives and option click the Time Machine icon in the menu bar to browse the other backup drives and see that history.\nMany people have their time machine data on several drives - you can safely put them on the shelf and move to a new drive rather than go back and edit the past. It's easy to move the whole package to a new drive if needed - just not splice data in to an existing backup folder.\nA great place for information is this time machine and internals site  and also the Time Machine discussions forum at Apple (I'm assuming we're talking about Snow Leopard here).\n\nA: Time Machine does not (or should not) work when you tamper with it's files in any way. Even a cloning of the TM backup and restoring it can (and probably will) make Time Machine not work with the backups anymore.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6044", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

{"text": "Q: How to disable CMD+Q combination? I am using WinOS at the office and MacOS at home. But I am more experienced on WinOS. While i am browsing (via Firefox), I use \u2318 CMD+Q accidentally to write \"@\" mark because of WinOS and keyboard habits. So, the browser quits and I lose all what I've written.\nIs there a way to constrain this key combination on MacOS or do I have to look for it on Firefox? (I know, the best way is adapting MacOS but mostly I am working on WinOS.)\n\nA: Unfortunately, Firefox (at least the 3.6 version I experimented with) does not disable the command shortcut for Quit when you change it in System Preferences.\nI think the quick and easy fix for this is to add \u2318Q as a global shortcut to something else innocuous. In my experiments, I found this to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Click on the Keyboard pane.\n\n*Click Keyboard Shortcuts tab.\n\n*Click Expos\u00e9 & Spaces shortcuts in the left side list.\n\n*Under \"Expos\u00e9\" change the shortcut for \"Desktop\" to \u2318Q\n\n\nNow when you accidentally hit \u2318Q, your desktop will magically and amusingly appear reminding you of your folly. Hit \u2318Q again and you're back exactly where you were.\nAs a sidenote, after a while you may want to change this back after you \"unlearn\" your behaviour. \u2318Q, the Mac equivalent to \"ALT-F4\" has been the standard shortcut since the introduction of the Macintosh, and like the other \"standard\" shortcuts \u2318W,\u2318Z,\u2318C,\u2318V and so on, it's best to learn them to ease use of other Mac computers or when you upgrade.\n\nA: Here's how to change that particular shortcut for Firefox:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences. This is in the Applications folder.\n\n*Go to the Keyboard pane, and click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab.\n\n*Click the [+] button near the bottom.\n\n*Select Firefox from the Application menu. For Menu Title, type 'Quit Firefox' (without the quotes)\n\n*For the Keyboard Shortcut, push a key combination that you're not likely to hit by accident (control-q, for example).\n\n*Open Firefox. Now, cmd-q does nothing (you can quit with ctrl-q, or whatever you set it to).\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I'm on macOS Ventura and I need to remove the \u201cClose Window\u201d shortcut Cmd+W, as I often accidentally close an app.\nThe way to do it is to find out the exact specific command in the menu bar.

It's stuck on the 'connect to iTunes' screen. \niTunes does recognize the iPhone, but when I select 'restore', it goes through a few progress bars, then errors again. I've already tried to hard reset the phone, but that doesn't work either.\n\nA: Please note that the instructions I am giving are assuming you are using an English copy of Windows, since I do not have a Mac and therefore do not have much experience with them.  However, the steps will be very similar, and I will try to note where things might be different for Mac OS X.\nFirst, check all of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your copy of iTunes is up-to-date. In Windows, open iTunes, click \"Help\", then \"Check for Updates\".\n\n*Make sure you are connected to the internet and the connection is reliable.  iTunes contacts Apple several times during the restore procedure, and if iTunes fails to get a response during one of these check-ins, the restore will fail.\n\n*Make sure you are using the correct version of iTunes for your system.  If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows, you will need to install the 64-bit version of iTunes.  If you have Windows XP, you need the normal 32-bit version. If you have Vista or Windows 7, click the start orb, right-click computer, then click \"Properties\". In the \"System\" section, look for the line that starts with \"System Type\". If it says 32-bit, use the normal iTunes installer. If it says \"64-bit Operating System\", download the 64-bit version of iTunes from http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1047  (If you have trouble determining whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit copy of Windows installed, try installing iTunes using http://www.ninite.com and it will automatically download the right version)\n\n*Delete the restore files from your computer. In Windows, press WindowsKey+R, type '%appdata%\\apple computer\\itunes' then delete the folders iPod Software Update and iPhone Software update if they exist.  If you are using OS X, the folder should be ~/Library/iTunes/.\n\n*If it still isn't working, uninstall iTunes, reboot, then install iTunes again, then reboot again.\n\n\nIf none of the above work, do the following to place your iPhone into DFU mode.  Some people have better luck with restoring with this method.\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the iPhone into the computer, and wait for it to be recognized in iTunes.\n\n*Press and hold the home and sleep buttons.\n\n*As soon as the iPhone screen goes blank, count to six seconds. At six, release the sleep button, and continue holding the home button.\n\n*You should see or hear the new hardware notification on your computer. When you do, you can release the home button.  If the new hardware notification, wait until iTunes recognizes it and tells you it found an iPhone in restore mode.\n\n*The iPhone screen should be blank. If it shows the \"Connect to iTunes\" screen, unplug it, then try again from step 1.\n\n\nA: If you see Connect to iTunes screen when you start iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch \nIn some situations, you might see the Connect to iTunes screen when you start your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. When this happens, your device is in recovery mode. Here's what to do.\nRestart your device by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time until you see the Apple logo.\nIf you see the Connect to iTunes screen again, you'll need to reinstall iOS. Follow these steps:\n1. Connect your device to your computer.\n2. You should see this message: \"The software on [your device name] needs to be restored to factory settings or updated.\"\n3. Click Update to reinstall iOS while keeping your data.\nGet help if, after following the steps above, you see a restore error.\nIf you don't see a restore error, but you still see the Connect to iTunes screen when you start your device, contact Apple.\nSource - https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203122\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6067", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}

How can I make the Safari tab bar display all of the tabs?\nRight now it displays only n tabs and the remaining are only accessible through a >> button.\nHow can I display all tabs at once without needing to scroll horizontally? Can tabs be set to shrink to a much smaller size, to display more at once?\n\nA: Actually there is a plugin (not to be confused with an extension) called Glims which allows the tabs to have a minimum width roughly the size of the close button. It's free - Glims\nThe screen resolution you are set to will ultimately determine your results, but for me I can normally only fit 13 tabs in a full screen Safari window. With Glims installed and this option turned on, it fits around 50 tabs. After that it resumes the usual behavior of giving you the >> for more tabs.\nThe drawback is obviously you loose your tab titles, making it difficult to discern one tab from another and this is why Apple chose to impose this arbitrary limitation. However there is another feature in Glims to display the website's favicon in the place where the close tab button usually is. This helps alleviate the aforementioned dilemma to an extent.\nFYI - Glims does much more than that as well.\n\nA: You can also try those following keys: Cmd + Shift + T but also chose go to view\" Show Tab Bar.\nIf you are looking for a fresh app I recommand you to try the sweet Tabexpos\u00e9 which works for Leopard as well as Snow Leopard\n\nA: It sounds as if you already know you can click on the \u00bb to see the additional tabs.\nOutside of that, your only other option is to make the browser window wider.\n\nA: In Safari 14 for macOS 11 Big Sur, tabs now shrink down to the size of their Favicon.

The possible delay means that if you yank a USB device before the buffers have flushed you may end up with a corrupted drive, or a set of corrupted files on the drive.\nIf you only read from a device, then there is NO NEED to flush the write buffers before you yank to your heart's content because they are empty and don't need to be flushed to the device. \nSo... The annoying MAC OS X warning is most probably NOT relevant. It is only important to do so if you have recently written to the device, and haven't given it enough time to flush the buffers (a few seconds, max). It is NEVER necessary to wait for the buffers to flush if you are only reading from the USB device.\nTherefore Apple NEEDS to provide a way to disable individual messages for power users. Don't treat everyone as a n00b who can't be relied on to know how their computer works.\nAnd to those who complain that I'm wrong, and there is a way to disable the messages by disabling the ENTIRE NOTIFICATION SUBSYSTEM are just plain wrong. Disabling the entire notification subsystem isn't an acceptable solution, just as removing the battery from your cell phone is NOT an acceptable solution to receiving too many telemarketing calls. The notification subsystem is important and shouldn't be disabled just because the OP finds one of the many myriad of messages to be annoying.\nThis is a problem that can only be adequately solved by Apple providing a way for users to opt out of specific messages.\n\nA: your answer is here. Just replace a file with the one mentioned at the end of this article and jobs done. Nothing has changed in Sierra or High Sierra.\nDisabling OS-X Device Removal Warnings In Yosemite\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6078", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "57"}}

It give you a total memory of 3773288 kB (or 3.6 GB). The procfs documentation tells you that MemTotal as reported by meminfo corresponds to \"Total usable ram (i.e. physical ram minus a few reserved bits and the kernel binary code)\". So you have about 400 MB used for the firmware and the kernel image. Firmware could include BootCamp and the graphical memory. For the kernel, it is a bit more complicated to know, you would have to properly unzipped your kernel (/boot/vmlinuz...) to know the right size it takes in memory.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6079", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: How to know my kernel extensions are 64-bit ready? Is there an easy way to tell whether all my kernel extensions will \"survive\" booting with a 64 bit kernel? I can of course try the \"6-4 finger boot\", but maybe there is a piece of hardware I use infrequently and that won't work when I use it in a month, leaving me to wonder what went wrong.\nI can see a list of extensions in System Profiler > Software > Extensions, with 8 of them listed as not \"64-bit (Intel)\", but 5 of them are \"Pseudoextensions\" with a Load Address \"built-in to the kernel\", and the 3 others are CHUD-related and will probably be gone once I update Xcode? Is that enough to conclude that I won't have problems? Or are there extensions that are not loaded now and that I can test somehow?\n\nA: As far as I know, System Profiler won't display information for any .kext's that are being loaded and are located somewhere else besides the /System/Library/Extensions/ folder.\nTo get comprehensive information about the kernel extensions which are currently loaded and in use on your Mac, you can use the kextstat command line tool.\nOpen up the Terminal application (in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder), type the following at the prompt, and then hit return:\n kextstat\n\nYou will get a large list of all the loaded kernel extensions. You'll primarily want to focus on the bundle identifiers of the loaded .kexts. (That's the backwards domain name string such as \"com.apple....\"). You should be able to eliminate the ones that include \"com.apple\", as those will be Apple's and should have a K64 version. Once you've gotten rid of those, you'll then need to go over the remaining ones to make sure they are built as universal K32+K64 versions, or whether you may need to make sure you have the latest updates.\nFor example, after eliminating all the Apple kexts on the output I get, I have the following kexts listed.

It feels quite clumsy, it's fairly slow and it's not something you'd want to be a regular part of your work flow. \n\nYou're unable to select text, which means no copy or pasting. If you double-tap at the end of a sentence to get a period, you won't be rewarded with that particular mobile shortcut.

Tabs can only be inserted with an external keyboard, tables cannot be created at all (viewing and editing the contents of an existing table is possible), multiple columns is impossible, etc. It is impossible to use the desktop version of Google Docs in a browser on an iPad.\nSo the Google Docs iPad app is useable but you will probably have to make certain changes on a laptop or desktop machine if your document is more than a simple note.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6091", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}

If you require a legal answer to this question, consult a lawyer.\n\nA: I think the primary sticking point with the iOS App Store was the fact that even if you had the source code it wasn't possible to modify and redistribute an application to iOS devices without agreeing to Apple's iOS App Store terms, as that is the only way to get apps on the device.\nThe same is not true, however, with the Mac App Store - you could easily provide the source that people can use to modify and distribute the application outside of the Mac App Store, so I think there is no problem with GPL'd apps in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: We have a GPL project which we'd like to distribute on the MAS. In my (non-lawyer) opinion it's probably OK to distribute on the MAS, but we may not take the risk with our project.

But GPL doesn't require your software to be installable by everyone who downloads it. How is that any different from, say, distributing software that only runs on windows, which cannot be used by linux users unless they purchase a windows pc and agree to the included EULA?\n\nThe same is not true, however, with the Mac App Store - you could easily provide the source that people can use to modify and distribute the application outside of the Mac App Store, so I think there is no problem with GPL'd apps in the Mac App Store.\n\nWhat exactly would the requirements be?

Seems like you should be able to have a binary-only distribution on the app store, and a code-only distribution on your website (eg: google code).\nAvoiding a second binary distribution would be nice, our team doesn't do binary releases as often as we should \u2014 simply because of all the work involved.\nThis mess is one more reason to change to MIT or BSD, a process we had already begun for other reasons, and are soon to complete. We should be fixing bugs, not discussing the legal restrictions dictating precisely how we give our work to the whole world.\n\nA: If you mean taking software that you do not hold copyright to, and which you are only allowed to use and copy because it was licensed under the GNU GPL, then no.\nThe FSF spells it out here: section 6 of the GPL says \"You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein\", and the Mac App Store Terms of Service explicitly add other restrictions.\nThe Software Freedom Law Center's legal representative confirmed this: the App Store agreements, on all platforms, are incompatible with the GNU GPL.\nApple seems to be disallowing GPL programs in the App Store as a matter of policy, but if you managed to sneak one through, then the author of the program could go after you for violating their copyright.\nA completely different case is where you hold the copyright to a piece of software.  In that case, you are welcome to distribute it under more than one license.  (For example, Firefox was for a while licensed under the MPL, GPL, and LGPL.  MySQL is licensed under the GPL and also a proprietary license.)  So if you sell a program through the Mac App Store, you can also release it under the GPL -- assuming you are allowed to do each of these things independently.\n(If you wanted to use somebody else's GNU GPL-licensed code in one of the App Stores, you could write to the copyright holder and see if they're willing to sell you an alternative license to their software.  They're under absolutely no obligation to do this, of course.)\nVLC ran into trouble (I think) because copyright for the software was held by many different people, and the whole program was only allowed to be distributed under the GPL.  Some programs sidestep such issues by requiring contributors to assign copyright to them, but most don't.\n\nA: I am going to disagree with the sentiment that GPL code cannot be included in either App Store. (as well as stir the pot a bit with no offense to anyone who has answered this so far in good faith!)\nOf course anyone CAN take code that is GPL and send it to the app store. Apple has no way to know what code you used unless you somehow embed the license file in the binary. You or someone else has to call their attention to that fact.\nApple's license linked from the Mac App store currently runs 16.7k words in length and allows for a third party license to be different and bind you in addition to their licenses.\n\nThe GPLv3 currently runs 5.2k words - many of which are openly intended to combat DRM and adding restrictions not expressly already a part of GPL (say like an N-device limitation)\nIt's clear that both the license that Apple attaches to Mac App store and iTunes App store isn't any version of GPL. It's also clear both are intended to be binding legal documents.\nSo a simple \"can you have...\" question boils down to several implied questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do Apple's terms and conditions for App Store distribution preclude you from using code obtained under a GPL license?\n\n*Does GPL prevent you from distribution channels that use DRM or don't include verbatim (and solely) GPL licensing in the terms of sale / use.\n\n*Is it probable that:\n\n\n*\n\n*That they are in some (or any) way compatible?\n\n*That it will get caught?\n\n*That there will be repercussions for going down that path?\n\n\n\nAll the non-lawyers here (me included) are barking at the moon, dancing around questions of the legality of very specific licenses governing intellectual property and copyright. The barking is intelligent and well-meant, but barking nonetheless.\nPretending that GPL is a free ride and comes with no restrictions is naive - it is intended as a legal document with real teeth. I don't intend to insult anyone - just point out how inadequate even a good faith attempt at trying to answer this question will be.\n\nA: You clearly and evidently can have GPL software in the iOS App Store \u2014 WordPress being one of the more prominent examples (1). It also wasn't Apple who objected to VLC in the iOS App Store; it was one of VLC's developers (and there was a heavy debate on the mailing list about whether his interpretation was correct).\nFor the Mac App Store, I'll lean even closer to it not being an issue. Unlike on iOS, anyone can inspect, modify, compile and run your GPL'd code for free\u00a0on a Mac; there is no need to pay $99/yr, or to agree to Apple's ADC policies.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6109", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "47"}}

By this I mean that it cannot be turned on, an doesn't show any sign of activity when connected to the PC, a docking station and other chargers. Of course iTunes does not recognize the device when plugged in to the PC. This happened, without prior signs of a coming malfunction, about 2 months after I bought it, used, during the last summer.\nWhat are my options in trying to bring it back to life? At the moment, buying a new iPod Touch is not an option.\n\nA: Try leaving it connected to a PC or Mac for several hours. If the Battery is completely empty, it will take some time to turn on. Happens to my 8GB iPod (which is not used much anymore) every time I leave it disconnected for 2 weeks or more.\nTHe only other option I can think of is trying to use a tool called RecBoot to boot the iPod into recovery mode.

{"text": "Q: Syncing Contacts and iCal between multiple Macs and iOS? I have a two Macs, an iPod Touch and an iPad, so 4 devices in total.\nI wonder if there is a way to sync contacts and ical calendars between these devices automatically (or in case of the iPod/iPad when they are connected to a mac).\nSo far, I'm seeing these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*MobileMe - seems really expensive for what it offers and stores data in the cloud\n\n*Mac OS X Server - requires a dedicated machine and is also not cheap\n\n*Syncing with Google Contacts and Calendars - requires the data to go to the cloud, but is free\n\n\nIs there anything that simply allows me to sync from Mac to Mac to iOS through my local network?\n\nA: I've been extremely happy with iCloud syncing between MacBook Pro, iPhone, and iPad. Once set up it works flawlessly and reliably unlike MobileMe which I had for years and was useful but never totally trustworthy. iCloud really is a great solution for syncing address book and calendar and reminders. I'm also enjoying it's syncing of bookmarks and other safari browser data.\nMy only caveat about it is that some MobileMe users have had some issues in doing the move. None of these issues to my knowledge have been unsolveable but there have been some bumps. For users with an Apple ID and no legacy of MobileMe use it's extremely smooth to set up.\nAll iOS devices need to be running iOS 5, Macs need latest version of Lion.\nhttp://www.apple.com/icloud/setup/\n\nA: I'm using Google Calendars and Contcts for this, it works really well. My iPhone has been set up with Google sync, so the calendar/contact updates get pushed automatically (when there's a network connection).\n\nA: The iOS devices will sync with a Mac when they're connected to it and you sync via iTunes, so we don't need to worry about those.\nMarkSpace's SyncTogether product will allow you to sync your calendars and address book (and some other stuff) between the Macs. BusySync (or its big brother BusyCal) will do the calendars but not the address book. Fruux does calendars and address books, but its in beta and I know nothing about its reliability. But none of those is free -- I don't know of any free options other than syncing via Google.\n\nA: For calendars you might want to look into BusyCal (if you really don't want your data in the cloud).\nOtherwise go with iCloud (the MobileMe replacement). It's free and syncs a lot more than just contacts and calendars.\n\nA: This is the Calender Server from OS X Server that works on normal OS X fine. It's fairly simple, the instructions are included.\nhttp://www.macosforge.org/post/calendar-and-contacts-server/\n\nA: For information about the full article \"Mac OS X and iOS Syncing with Google\"\nhttp://devicegadget.com/apple/mac-os-ios-syncing-google/1214/\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6127", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

Are you using A/B/G/N?\nWhat's the memory usage look like on both systems? Is one (or both) maxed out? The traffic seems very bursty. This could indicate that one or both sides can't buffer the stream properly (i.e., not enough free memory).\nDo you have the same problems when configured to use an Ad Hoc network? If not then the problem is your WAP.\n\nA: You should try the transfer in FTP only because FTP sets it's own \"MTU\". If this sends files very quickly, you are looking at a TCP fragmentation issue, i.e., you are sending TCP packets too large for the router to handle on it's own.

As my parents are not good at using computers, I need to control the Mac remotely. \nIs there any software tool for it?\n\nA: There are a lot!\nLogMeIn is one of them, which has the benefit to have a web interface and doesn't need your parents computer to have a fixed IP. You install the client on their computer, register it and then you'll be able to control it via your interface.\nGive it a look, it's quite good. The free version doesn't have all advanced features (obviously) but it's quite enough for remote help of parents' computers (I use it for this same purpose and I also do it for computers in Canada while I'm in Europe!)\n\nA: A number of good solutions have been posted.\nFor completeness sake, I want to mention something that easily lets you see, if not control, the remote computer.  Skype lets you \"share the desktop\", which sends an image of the user's computer over as if it were a video chat.\nIt's not as good as actual control, I will agree, but it's cross-platform and can help out a lot in a pinch.\n\nA: The Mac comes with the server part of the software built-in for \"Apple Remote Desktop\"; They can be viewed and managed remotely if you have the client software. For most of us that's too expensive a solution, so an alternate is to use VNC. Check out JollysFastVNC and Chicken of the VNC.\nAlso, iChat, which comes with the Macs, can do screen sharing, which might be all you need. Check out \"Share and share alike.\" from Apple's iChat site and \"Sharing your screen with a buddy\".\n\nA: I have used logmein, teamviewer, ichat and teamviewer emerged winner due to its simplicity and availability of a free iPhone app as a bonus! Try them all, simple and easy.\n\nA: Here's a step by step (the free, reliable route):\n\n\n*\n\n*Download \"Vine server\" and install it on your mac. \n\n*Go to dyndns.org (dynamic DNS), register, and create a free domain name pointer for yourself.  This will create a hostname that points to your house's ip address all the time (ie bill.dyndns.org --> 123.123.123.123).\n\n*Once you get a dyndns domain name, login to your router and put your login information in for the domain name you just got from dyndns.  Look around, there should be a page for DDNS.  If there's not, then grab the dyndns software.\n\n*While in your router, open up a port for vnc.  The default for VNC is 5900.\n\n*Restart VNC server.\n\n*Now, from outside of the mac's house, grab a vnc client...  there are many.  A good one for PC is vncviewer, tightvnc, others.  Just google PC or MAC free VNC client.\n\n*Open the client vnc, put in your dyndns hostname as the IP, and the port is 5900.\n\n\nA: (I'm going to mention this for completeness rather than because I think you'd actually use it). \nThere's a product called Timbuktu which is a bit more hard-core than LogMeIn, VNC and Remote Desktop, but really it does something very similar. \nIt's a paid-for program (and not really that cheap, to be fair) but it does work BRILLIANTLY, it's fast, you can get compatible Windows versions (so Mac-Mac, Mac-Windows, Windows-Windows etc) and it makes a decent job of useful things like file transfers, clipboard syncing and handling different screen resolutions etc.\nI've used Timbuktu to remotely control my office Mac from my laptop for a couple of years now and I'm a very happy customer.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6133", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

I know of the screencapture command for the last part of my proposed solution.\n\nI would like to be able to restore my desktop work environment after a reboot. I have one idea how to do this.\nReason: I reboot every 2 - 4 weeks. I have 9 virtual desktops, each with a few to a dozen windows and applications. After a computer reboot it feels like a brain reboot and takes a few days to get everything back.\nConcept: Manually prior to a planned reboot, or perhaps once a day via cron in case of accidental reboot or system freeze, I'd like to somehow capture the system state in order make recovery post-reboot easier.\nIdeal Solution: I prefer the CLI. My ideal solution would be a text file of open files on each desktop, and terminal windows on each desktop, and what folder those terminal windows are in. I could then write a script that would go to desktop 1, open all the PDFs there in Preview, open all the .m files in AquaMacs, and open the terminals and cd them to the correct folder, etc. Repeat for each desktop.\nI think AppleScript could easily tell me what PDFs are open in Preview.app, but I don't think it can tell me what desktop they are on.

The following sets the delay to 1 minute.\ndefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-edge-delay -float 60 && killall Dock\nsource: Leopard: Lower the window drag delay between spaces\n\nA: OS X - Snow Leopard seems to have two states when it comes to the switching behavior. Dragging a window or not dragging a window. If you are not dragging a window, it ignores your mouse hovering at a side. This makes sense, or the dock and hot corners would be very hard to use. When you are dragging a window, it auto-switches workspaces if you hang around at a side. This also makes sense.\nSometimes though, it seems to get confused about if you're dragging a window or not. When this happens, even if you aren't dragging a window, it still flips workspaces if you hover the mouse on a side, thereby making the dock and hot corners very hard to use.\nIn order to reset this state, I figured out that you can pick up a window, drag it around a bit, then let go. This seems to reset its \"you're currently dragging a window\" state with respect to workspace switching.\n\nA: It only switches when you're actively dragging something and linger on the edge of the screen for several seconds. Simply hovering shouldn't change anything. \n\nA: I am using Warp successfully to do that.  I've checked \"Enable Warp\" and \"Click screen edge to Warp\".  When I touch an edge, I get a small window surrounding the cursor that either shows a tiny view of the adjacent space and its windows, or says \"No windows\" -- is that what you're seeing?  At that point, clicking will change spaces, or you can back away from the edge to remain in the same space.\nEdit:  Oops - I have to backtrack. My answer applies to just the mouse cursor, not to dragging a window.  I see the same behavior you describe if I drag a window to the edge and hover there holding it: Spaces will switch repeatedly until I back the cursor off of the edge.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6141", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "22"}}

{"text": "Q: OS X 10.6 : Automating new system provisioning with scripts I've been working on this for days but simply cannot find the correct references to make it work.\nThe idea is to have a script that will baseline newly purchased Macs that comes into the company with basic stuffs like set autologin to off, create a new admin user (for remote admins to access for support, set password to unlock screensaver and etc) .\nSample list for baseline that admins have to do on each new machine:\n\nClick the Login Options button\nSet Automatic Login: OFF\nCheck: Show the Restart, Sleep, and Shutdown buttons\nUncheck: Show input menu in login window\nUncheck: Show password hints\nUncheck: Use voice over in the login window\nCheck: Show fast user switching menu as Short Name\n\n(note: this is only part of a long list to do on each machine)\nI've managed to find some references to make some parts work.

The IT department at my company maintains a disk image with all of the settings in place they need to administer the Macs when they are received-including software in place registered with site licenses. They open the Macs and simply replace what's on the hard drive with the disk image.\nScripting is a logical path, but scripting System Preferences is a real bear because you have to go with GUI Scripting which is rife with problems, the least of which trying to decipher UIElementInspector to get what you need.\n\nA: You're talking about things that would probably be easier to do with a mix UI scripting, and scripting System Preferences.UI scripting is where you write an AppleScript that opens System Preferences and clicks buttons. Scripting System Preferences directly is where you talk to the app. Support for this is... patchy. You can use one where the other fails.\nHere is some info about scripting System Preferences. Some info on UI scripting SysPrefs is here, and better examples can be downloaded here (direct link). They are installed to your ~/Library/Scripts/System Preferences folder.\nHope this helps.

{"text": "Q: Can I play audio from my iPhone on my Mac? Can I attach my iPhone 3GS to my Mac Pro so that the iPhone's audio plays through the Mac Pro's speakers?\nI can easily attach my Bose headphones so that the music from the iPhone plays through them\u2026 that's cool\u2026 but I want others to hear the music through my Mac Pro's speaker system.\n\nA: You can play your iPhone's music out your mac via iTunes. You don't even have to be in sync with that iTunes library, just plug it in, navigate to your music, and press play.\nIf you're talking about like game audio coming out your mac's speakers... I'd take your speakers and plug them straight into the phone. There's no way I know of to use the mac as an audio route from the phone.\n\nA: The LineIn free app worked great.\nThe Rogue Amoeba product LineIn is an excellent free utility for listening to external audio.\nAdvantages over QuickTime Player\nLineIn has several advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*LineIn has lower (nearly none!) audio lag, whereas QuickTime Player has about ~500ms of increased audio latency.\n\n*Does not shift to the wrong speed/pitch issue; this is a problem that sometimes manifests with QuickTime Player.\n\n*Does not replace the top bar with 9:41 AM and 100% Battery.\n\n\nHow To\n\n\n*\n\n*After plugging the iPhone on your Mac (via Lightning/USB), enable the audio device in Audio Midi Setup.app:\n\n\n*Launch the LineIn.app, and select iPhone as the input source:\n \n\n*Hit Play Thru and you're done!\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the iPhone is not muted.\n\n*Step one will need to be done again once the iPhone is unplugged and plugged back in.\n\n\nA: Run Airfoil Speakers on your mac..it'll then allow you to airplay just like you would to an apple TV or airport express.  You do have to be on the same wifi network for this to work.\n\nA: Simple, and simply surprising:\n\n*\n\n*First, check that you have enabled the iPhone/iPad as an audio input device in Audio Midi Setup.app:\n\n\n\n\n*Plug in your iPhone to your Mac using your Lightning Cable (doesn't work with 30 pin iPhones, sorry. [Yes I know you said 3GS])\n\n\n*Launch QuickTime Player\n\n\n*Choose File> New Audio Recording\n\n\n*Click the hard-to-see down arrow next to the Record 'button', choose iPhone under 'Microphone'\n\n\n*Play your music, game whatever on your iPhone, sound will come thru your Mac.\nNo need to hit record, the sound will play even if you don't record. Just turn up the volume.\n\nNote: for those who want a louder volume, go to the system preferences on your Mac. Then go to the sound settings and you can increase the output volume so it is louder.\n\nA: If your iPhone is running (I think) 4.0 or above, I think most machines should be able to mount the phone and play the music through iTunes. \n\nA: The solution is to use Miccuss or some other Bluetooth audio receiver to receive the audio via Bluetooth and pass the signal via cable to the Mac's audio input.\nMiccuss works perfectly, the sound is pristine. \nI am not sure why Apple can't (or won't) enable Mac's to receive audio from Bluetooth devices even when the service seem to be available in the Bluetooth profile (handsfree gateway). MS Windows Bluetooth support handsfree gateway in a hassle free way which gives it a versatility score in this area over Mac.\n\nA: To Play Music\n\n*\n\n*Plug in iPhone to computer via USB\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Click iPhone button in iTunes near the the top left\n\n*Under Settings on the left there is  On My Device\n\n*Click Music, you should see all the music on your phone on the right.\n\n*Play that funky music.\n\n\nA: I tried all recommended with no sound output on a macbook pro. What worked for me is to use VLC player on the mac as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable iPhone in the Audio MIDI Setup (see \"Utilities\" folder in Finder)\n\n*Open VLC Player:\nFile -> \u201cOpen Capture Device\u201d\nClick Audio and select iPhone from the dropdown list\n\n\nStart playing on iPhone and listen on your mac! :)\n\nA: Sound from Apps\nThere are probably multiple ways to do this. Perhaps some could use the existing iPhone connector. But certainly if you get a male to male headphone adapter, you could take the audio out of the iPhone and into the audio input (mic) on the desktop, then use Audacity or another program to play the sound from the mic input\nMusic from iPhone\nIn iTunes, select your iPhone on the left column. Select music. Play.\n\nA: I know where this question is coming from. I sometimes like to plug my iPhone into the USB cable so it keeps being charged while I also like to play some type of videos like Periscope on the phone at all time. This leads to a problem that the AUX output from the iPhone will have background hiss noise because the USB port being plugged in.\nSo having the phone playing audio via the USB is the only method that can give you high quality audio output.\nBut unfortunately there is no commercially available method to create a USB audio receiver on OSX. But, there is an alternative. First, you must enable the iPhone's hotspot via USB. This can be done through purchasing hotspot plan from your wireless carrier or other illegal methods. Second, you must install a wireless audio receiver software like airfoil or airserver on your OSX. Third, you must enable the USB connection on your OSX's system setting under network. The name of such connection can be vary and unpredictable. Take your best guest. Fourth, enabling the audio playback on your iPhone via airplay. If you don't see the airplay, it means the connection isn't established successfully. Repeat the entire process until it does. It might never run successfully because of a number of reasons that can only be explained through a very long essay, of which I would not replicate here and now, and the connection may break after being established.\nNote this method will slow down your OSX sometimes quite dramatically.\n\nA: Turn a MacBook into an AirPlay receiver w/ macOS Monterey\n\nFortunately, there is now a better way. Installing MacOS Monterey\n(launching today) adds a feature dubbed \u2018AirPlay to Mac\u2019 which turns\nany MacBook or iMac into an AirPlay receiver. To activate \u2018AirPlay to\nMac\u2019, simply check the tickbox in the \u2018Sharing\u2019 preferences pane: the\nMacBook/iMac will now accept AirPlay audio streams from any iPhone or\niPad running iOS 15 or iPadOS 15 (or later). \u2018AirPlay to Mac\u2019 also\nworks with video content.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6173", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "60"}}
{"text": "Q: Which iPod has the best sound quality? I'd like to know if an iPod classic is a better investment than an iPod touch? I am really more into music than apps and games. If you have some other suggestions about great-sounding mp3 players I'd like to hear it.\n\nA: The 5th generation and earlier have the best sound because they use the Wolfson chips. (see this article for more info)\n\nA: I got an iPod Classic for Christmas to replace my aging iPod Mini (1st generation). The sound difference between the two is very obvious. I have a couple different sets of in-ear and over the ear headphones, all at least $100, that I used with the Mini, and with the Classic I'm hearing new stuff with every song. \nI attribute this to faster CPUs and better algorithms but I haven't checked to see how different the CPUs are. \n\nA: All current iPods support the same:\n\nFrequency response: 20Hz to 20,000Hz\n  Audio formats supported: AAC (8 to 320\n  Kbps), Protected AAC (from iTunes\n  Store), HE-AAC, MP3 (8 to 320 Kbps),\n  MP3 VBR, Audible (formats 2, 3, 4,\n  Audible Enhanced Audio, AAX, and\n  AAX+), Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV\n\nThis is from the Apple iPod tech specs page.\nSo, since they all support the same bitrates and formats, the quality does not change between models.\nGet whichever you want. The real sound quality difference will come from your speakers or headphones.\nNote: If you want the best sound, use the Apple Lossless format.\n\nA: Whoever will tell you the \uf8ffdevices have the same sound output capabilities is certainly not an audiophile or is simply someone who needs an ears'check. I own an iPod Touch 2G, an iPod Nano 7th Gen, iPod Classic 5th Gen, iPhone 4S, iPhone 6s, iPad Air 2. The best, crisper, crystal clear sound, after testing all devices with the same FLAC album, same headphones and no equalizers enabled, the best audio quality comes out from the iPod Classic.\nPeriod.\n\nA: If you are not considering the speaker of the iPod Touch itself, the music is happening on a different device.  The only considerations then are whether the player can handle the music you throw at it, considering sample rate, bit rate, and compression.  Cheaper MP3 players, for example, could only handle 128 kbit/s, which wouldn't technically sound as good as 192 kbit/s.  CD quality sound is 44.1 kHz and ~1,400 kbit/s.  The MP3 is compressed, so the bit rate is obviously less.\nThe other consideration is whether your player's flash can be upgraded.  The downside to this is having it run very slowly.\nAnother consideration is how you will use it, whether it will be jogging or setting in a cradle to a bigger sound system.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6178", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

I've also installed the Apple Bootcamp drivers from the OS X install disk and updated to the latest version. It mapped all my keys just fine, but I was surprised it does not offer an option to switch the mappings of Alt and Windows keys; ie. Alt is left of Spacebar, Windows key is left of Alt.\nThe current way directly maps to the physical keyboard layout, but not to the way people are used to working: e.g. OS X's Command+Tab for window switching is equivelant to Alt+Tab not Windows+Tab. I keep hitting the wrong keys because of muscle memory. :)\nIs there a built-in way to remap Windows and Alt keys?

You actually have to type hexadecimal code points in this app.\n\nA: There are applications in the App Store that display all of the characters allowed in the Unicode set that you can copy and paste into other applications like Mail and the like.

Ideally I'd like to be able to transfer over a cable or through WiFi.\nThanks for any tips.\n\nA: Since iOS 13, you are able to access SMB shares with the Files app. Just set up your share in the Linux system (I recommend usershares), create the user on samba (while samba allows you to have the same Linux user, it requires that you use samba specific utilities to set up the password) and use \"Connect to Server\" within Files on your iOS device.\n\nA: Look at the iOS app GoodReader.  GoodReader is a $5 app that allows you to transfer files from Windows, Mac OS X & Linux via WiFi to your iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch. You can then open the files in other apps based on the filetype.\n\nA: Simply install VLC app from the app store and use its wifi transfer feature (in the sidebar of vlc app) to transfer videos(in all formats recognizable by vlc) into your vlc library.... \nUPDATE: This method not only works for audio/video formats but pretty much all file formats. Ofcourse, VLC won't show these files but one could access them using any decent File manager app such as Document.\n\nA: Yes! You can transfer files to / from the iPad from Ubuntu via USB.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can always transfer files via SSH / a Samba share / etc.\n\n*However that would be over Wifi, which is nowhere near as fast as USB connectivity.\n\n*Via USB you can only access /var/root/Media on the ipad. Useful to put movies onto it - you will need to find a way to make these visible within iPad - I think you need to create some playlist?  \n\n\n*\n\n*I use FileBrowser on the iPad and since my iPad is jailbroken, I ssh in and mv the transferred files from /var/root/Media to /var/mobile/Applications/[app-ID]/.data/Movies/. It is then visible within FileBrowser and Movies can be played there. \n\n\n\nSteps\nInstall additional PPA repository\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pmcenery/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nInstall libimobiledevice-utils\nsudo apt-get install libimobiledevice-utils\n\nPlug in the iPad / iPod / iPhone. It is visible as a removable drive!\n\nA: For me on Ubuntu 18 all I had to do was install libimobiledevice-utils with \nsudo apt-get install libimobiledevice-utils\n\nand then reconnected the iPad, I can now browse my dam file and grab em just like normal folders thats just wonderful!!!\n\nA: Not sure if this will work for everybody, but I can get movies (mp4, didn't try any other format) onto the ipad through the 'Documents' app from the app store. When I connect the iPad to my comp with usb it brings up a folder called \"Documents on YOUR NAME's iPad\". In this I can open the Document app's folder and just drag and drop. The files appear in the app then....magic! \n\nA: *\n\n*Install Zip & RAR File Extractor in your iPad\n\n*Create a zip folder in your Linux machine of the files which you want to transfer.\n\n*Open the Zip extractor app on your iPad, then go to Wi-Fi Transfer. It will show a web address. Write that address into your Linux web browser. There is an option of \"Upload files\", just click and upload the zip file and then transfer.\n\n*Open iPad files, go to \"On My iPad\" and then go to the \"Zip Extractor folder\". You can see that the file has been transferred. Touch on that zip file, and you will see the file has been extracted.\n\n\nA: FileBrowser is very good for transferring files.\n\nA: I used to transfer by uploading to dropbox and downloading files on the dropbox app on my ipad. \nThere is another way which doesn't need internet which is using the app called \"wireless drive\". With this basically you connect your ipad with your laptop by creating wifi hotspot and transfer the files. But my ipad is unable to connect the wifi created by my new laptop. (wifi connection problem for unknown reason) ..... what do I do? I dont have internet right now.\nYou do following (after installing the app):\n\n\n*\n\n*just connect ipad to laptop using usb cable.\n\n*You see \"documents on the ipad\" as a usb drive (as the external-pen drive)\n\n*open the documents on the ipad > you see different apps you have on the ipad\n\n*You will see \"wireless drive\" in the list, open it by double-clicking.\n\n*You will see folder \"documents\", open it.\n\n*You will see folder is empty, if it's used for the first time.\nJust simply copy whatever you want to copy to your ipad in this folder and that's it!! \n\n\nNow, just open the \"wireless drive\" app on your ipad, and you see the files you have transferred. Tap on any of the document, you will be asked which app to be used to open/run the file, select appropriate app and you can use the file on your ipad.\n\nA: Download Folder Lock for your iPad and enjoy its WiFi File Transfer feature.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id372925917?pt=329691&ct=fa&mt=8\n\nA: Install Phone Drive Free from the app store. You don't need to jailbreak your idevice.\nPhone Drive Free will tell you the device address. Enter this into your web browser. The browser will give you an interface to drag n drop your files. \n\nA: I just connected my iPad 2021 to Ubuntu 22.04 and I got access to Clips, GarageBand and several other folders. As soon as I copied files to GarageBand I could see them on the iPad.\n\nA: Install Apache on your Linux machine:\nsudo apt install apache2\n\nAnd copy your files to /var/www/html. Remove /var/www/html/index.html so you can browse the directory. Then just point the web browser on your iPad to your Linux machine.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6221", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "23"}}
{"text": "Q: iPhone to iTunes application transfer \n*\n\n*Usually people used to download application on iTunes & then install it on their iPhone using iTuens sync. \n\n*Currently, I have an iPhone that I bought from my friend. \n\n*He had purchased many applications on iPhone. \n\n*When I connected the phone to my iTunes, it asked to transfer or don't transfer. When I choose, transfer - It transfered all the items. \n\n*Even though it was not from same account of itunes.\n\n*I have different iTunes account & purchased application was from different itunes account even though it could transfer - my question is why - iTunes allows doing this ? \n\n\nOk. One more problem that I faced is as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I was in wifi range, I directly downloaded an application ( using same account which I have on my itunes ).\n\n*Next when I connected iPhone to iTunes, it didn't transferred anything & I lost my downloaded application.\n\n\nDid any-one faced this issue ? If yes,\nWhat did you do to resolve this issue ?\nThanks in Advance for sharing your great Knowledge.\nSugar.\n\nA: 1)your friends itunes account was probably registered on your phone when you synced with the computer.\n2) you can only be synced with one itunes account at a time. your problem might be that your synced with your friends account so any app that you download with your account wont be able to sync any apps unless you change it to sync with your account(which will delete all apps not purchased with your account.)\n\nA: Either there was previous authorization on your system for his account, or if the iPhone was modified in some fashion (ie. Jailbreak), then any predictability with normal function goes out the window.\nIf iTunes synced and removed an application without any warning, then there is a problem with your iTunes, or there may be a corruption with the iPhone requiring a possible restore. I'd de-authorize the computer, re-authorize, and then sign out and back in on your iPhone with further testing.\n\nA: It is possible to use applications from different accounts on one iPhone. I do this too, where I usually download the free apps with my account and the paid with my wife's (we usually only buy using gift cards, and by redeeming all gift cards on one account we save up the spare cents after each 0.99\u20ac song). For this to work, I needed to authorize my iTunes installation to use stuff bought using my wife's account.\nSo it's possible that you authorized your computer some time in the past to play music from your friends computer (even by streaming them, not only a file copy), and iTunes remembered this authorization so you can get the apps now. For updates to these apps it will ask for the password of your friend, so you see this use-case is usually limited to situations where people know each other very well and password sharing is not a big problem (in one household, usually).\nIn the mobile version of the App Store you can see which account you're logged in as by scrolling down on the first page. If it's still acting weird a restore could help that. Since you were able to transfer the purchased apps from the iPhone to your computer, you should be able to place them back after the restore.\n\nA: You must ensure you sync the iPhone with one and the same iTunes account. To authorize/deauthorize iTunes, you might want to have a look at this Apple page:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1420\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6224", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}
{"text": "Q: What are the best mnemonics to remember important short cuts? In my job I teach a lot of people to use macs. Since you use what you remember I'm always on the look out for funny or memorable ways to remember keyboard or system shortcuts (like you have the option to command escape, I know it's corny, but it works for newbies!). \nWhat are the mnemonics you use to remember important keyboard or system shortcuts? Funny is a bonus. \nEDIT / UPDATE\nSorry I've been away for a bit and haven't updated my question for a bit. A bit more info - I'm teaching a digital class of 8,9 and 10 year olds (who have a MacBook each) this year; and I'm looking for funny ways for them to remember the things you commonly do on your mac. Kids love learning shortcuts (for some reason) and any thing I can do to help them build confidence and have a laugh is great. \nHere are the shortcuts that would be handy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Force Quit (That was my example, you\nhave the option to\ncommand escape).\n\n*Search (command space)\n\n*Command Tab\n\n*Expose (Four fingers down on the mouse pad!?)\n\n*Command ShiftK (Connect to a nearby server in finder)\n\n*Apple ShiftA for Applications\n\n*Anything else you might think is handy. \n\n\nI know it's a bit of a vague question, I'm just looking for any fun and easy way to teach these shortcuts. \n\nA: Spotlight:\nI've heard it remembered as 'space command'. Like you're the commander of a futuristic spaceship and you're talking to the computer, asking it to look for something or open something. You're commanding the space ship.\nPress command-space to access Space Command.\n\nA: Of the most commonly used keyboard shortcuts, I've found that most new users find the ones for \"cut\" and \"paste\" are the most difficult to remember. Not difficult, though, if you think of the \"X\" for \"cut\" as a pair of scissors, and \"V\" for paste as \"viscous\".\nBut blindingly funny ones?  Hmm, you've stumped me there...\n\nA: \"Very much long work causes injury just because stress yanks energy gradually.\"\nmoVe    V very\nMarquee M much\nLasso   L long\nWand    W work\nCrop    C causes\nEye I injury\nHealing J just  (Jesus heals)\nBrush   B because\nStamp   S stress\nHistorY Y yanks\nErasor  E energy\nGradiant G gradually\nBlur    -- \n\"Optimum practice teaches attention under hard rigor.\"\nDOdge   O Optimum\nPen P Practice\nText    T Teaches\nSelect  A Attention\nShapes  U Under\nHand    H Hard\nRotate  R Rigor\nSwitch X (Exchange)\nDefault D\nQuick Mask  Q\nScreen F (Full)\n\nA: The most obvious mnemonic is really the first letter of the action wanted in combination with \u2318, e.g. \u2318-F for 'Find'. The hard part comes when that is reserved to some other command than the intended.\nI'd suggest first learning the most used shortcuts (maybe just one or two) and start using them whenever possible. After a while, when those come right from the spine, form a habit of adopting a few new shortcuts every week or month, what seems to be appropriate rate for one. Gradually one knows a conciderable amount of shortcuts.\n\nA: Command - F -- usually finds\nCommand - C -- usually copies\nCommand - V -- usually pastes\nCommand - F -- usually cuts\nCommand - Space -- spotlight, or I configured it to alfred\nCommand - Tab / Command - Shift - Tab -- Tab between open applications\nCommand - ` / Command - Shift - ` -- Tab between windows of current application\nCommand - T -- usually open a new tab\nCommand - W -- close current window / document\nCommand - Q -- quit current application\n\nCommand - [ -- history back (browser, finder)\nCommand - ] -- history forward (browser, finder)\nCommand - Shift - [ -- switch to previous tab\nCommand - Shift - ] -- switch to next tab\n\nCtrl - Left / Right -- Switch to different workspace left / right\nCtrl - Up -- Expose all windows of all apps\nCtrl - Down -- Expose all windows of current app\n\nWithout terminal commands thats what I use daily, no more. No less.\nTerminal is much more fun:\nCtrl - C -- sigint\nCtrl - D -- sigterm\nCtrl - R -- search bash history\nCommand - K -- clear terminal screen and scrollback\nCtrl - A -- move cursor to start of line\nCtrl - E -- move cursor to end of line\n\nI also use SizeUp with the following configurations\nCtrl - Option - Command - Up -- make window take up whole screen\nCtrl - Option - Command - Left -- make window take up left half of screen\nCtrl - Option - Command - Right -- make window take up right half of screen\n\nTo be honest, all my mnemonics are the letters/symbols with modifiers being what I want those to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*[ = back\n\n*] = forward\n\n*F = find\n\n*C = copy\n\n*V = paste (I can't spell so v is for paste)\n\n*X = cut (criss cross woot)\n\n*Left = left\n\n*Right = right\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6226", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: What are the differences between the AT&T and Verizon versions of iPhone 4? Besides working on their respective carriers, what are the similarities and differences between the AT&T iPhone 4 and Verizon iPhone 4?\n\nA: Due to the differences between CDMA and GSM, the antenna notches have been moved around. There are also 4 now instead of 3, and as a result of adding a notch on the left side of the phone, the mute switch is slightly lower on the Verizon iPhone 4 than the AT&T iPhone 4, which could cause cases made for the AT&T iPhone 4 to not fit the Verizon iPhone 4 properly:\n\nThough this may change in a future version of iOS, right now the Verizon iPhone 4 has a \"Personal Hotspot\" feature to share the data connection with up to 5 devices. In contrast, the AT&T iPhone 4 supports tethering through USB or Bluetooth only, and only to 1 device:\n\nFinally, because the Verizon iPhone 4 runs on Verizon's CDMA, it does not support simultaneous data and voice, unlike the AT&T iPhone 4 which does over 3G.\n\nA: Engadget summarized the differences... \nhttp://www.engadget.com/2011/01/11/atandt-iphone-4-vs-verizon-iphone-4-whats-changed/\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6236", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}
{"text": "Q: Is the Verizon iPhone 4 susceptible to the 'grip of death'? Of course, it's possible to get any phone to lose a bit of signal if you cover the antenna with your hands, but I'm wondering if the Verizon iPhone 4 also suffers from the attenuation issues that the AT&T iPhone 4 famously suffered from last summer:\n\n\nA: ArsTechnica notes that there is no  noticeable signal loss when gripping it with the 'death grip'. Though due to the way smart phone antennas are designed, it still may be possible\n\nA: As an add-on to the Ars report: photos of the adjustment of button locations also show differing locations of the breaks in the metal band around the device, so it's quite possible there was a real hardware change.  \n\nOther pictures show different breaks near the bottom of the phone, too.\n\nA: The flaw is in the iPhone 4's antenna design, not the network or carrier.  So, I would say yes.  The software \"fix\" they released is supposed to make the bars depict signal quality more accurately, so you may find that while on Verizon, \"the death grip\" doesn't affect signal quality at all or as much.. but that doesn't negate that the antenna design itself is flawed physically, and that's why \"the death grip\" has any affect on signal quality.\n\nA: Slashgear confirms that the Verizon iPhone 4 does not suffer from the death grip:\n\nWe put our hand in the standard \u201cdeath\n  grip\u201d location, making sure that we\n  covered up all of the right spots, and\n  held onto the device for up to a\n  minute. When we started the test, the\n  device was at four bars. It should be\n  noted that full service is represented\n  on the iPhone 4 with 5 bars. So, the\n  test started with only four bars being\n  shown.

{"text": "Q: My MacBook Pro uses an extraordinary amount of RAM I bought my MacBook Pro about 1.5 years ago (with 4 GB RAM) but these days I think it uses an extraordinary amount of memory; when I open Firefox & Adium & Thunderbird & iTunes & last.fm it uses 3.84 of my 4GB RAM. I must say I installed several 3rd-party software packages on my laptop (maybe on start up they run some process of itself) is there any tool that exists to help me tune my laptop and find what processes run functionless in background, or is there any guideline to help me fix this problem?\n\n\nA: It's probably just been a while since you restarted your computer. When you close a program, the memory it was using doesn't go back to \"Free\", it gets marked \"Inactive\". It's still available for use by other programs, though:\n\nInactive memory\nThis information in memory is not actively being used, but was recently used.\nFor example, if you've been using Mail and then quit it, the RAM that Mail was using is marked as Inactive memory. This Inactive memory is available for use by another application, just like Free memory.  However, if you open Mail before its Inactive memory is used by a different application, Mail will open quicker because its Inactive memory is converted to Active memory, instead of loading Mail from the slower hard disk.\n\n\nA: There are probably tools that make it easier to suss things out than using Activity Viewer, but in the end, you just have to be careful what you install. Depending on the applications you install, there may very well be frameworks, daemons, and the like that can run unnecessarily. last.fm is a music streaming application and that is a known resource hog.

{"text": "Q: Power adapter connection issues Lately, my Magsafe power adapter has not been connecting properly:\n\n\n*\n\n*The wires are not worn out as I take good care of them\n\n*The issue happens when I try to connect my power adapter to my computer\n\n*The LED does not come on and the MacBook does not get charged. I have to unplug and plug the power adapter several times until I can get a connection.\n\n*The cord and computer intake seem clean and no pins are pushed down\n\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Even if there isn't any obvious cable damage or bulging, the adapter could be failing. If the adapter is not one of the newer L-Shape Magsafe plugs, the need for a SMC firmware update is moot, but it's helpful to have the system up to date regardless.\nHave you confirmed if a second, known-good adapter works on your Mac?\nUpdated: An SMC reset can also correct magsafe LED issues. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\n\nA: Your MagSafe power adapter could require frequent reset because of an external problem: the electrical wiring in your home is substandard, and/or the power provided by your electrical company is sending \"dirty\" current out of your wall outlet and into your MagSafe adapter. This official Apple support document refers to this problem as \"line noise issues\".\nThis means that the alternating current (AC) is irregular, and the MagSafe adapter cannot handle it. The best way to test for this is to use your MagSafe adapter and your MacBook at another location, possibly in another neighborhood, in a house or business where the electrical wiring is newer. If the problem goes away, this is an indication that the electrical wiring and electrical service in your home are substandard. \nFixing this would of course be an expensive proposition, and involve the services of a professional electrical contractor to retrofit the electrical system in your home or business, or to install expensive power conditioning equipment.\n\nA: Do you restart your computer regularly?  If not, you may want to try that.  I suggest this because my early 2011 MacBook Pro's Magsafe indicator did not light up yesterday when I plugged it in.  This is the first time that I've seen this.  I tried several times and it did not light up and charging was not detected on the menu bar icon. \nAfter doing a full system reboot, everything was fine, though.  \nI'm not suggesting this will solve the problem, but it may be worth trying.\n\nA: When I had a problem like this (the light would not come on and the menu bar status icon said \u201cNot Charging\u201d), I called AppleCare and they chose to replace the power adapter, and the problem did not reoccur.\n\nA: Make sure you have the newest SMC firmware. This controls connecting to the MagSafe and charging.\nUse this Apple page to see if there are any updates available.\n\nA: I have a similar issue. It is reliably solved by rubbing the connections on one or both ends with a Q-tip. There may be some static or oxidation on the surface, and removing it solves my problem.

If I remember right, reboot holding D.  If that doesn't work, reboot while holding D, with an OS X disk in.  Of course you'll need to have an external DVD drive for that to work.\n\nA: It would depend first on what it means to not read the discs.

{"text": "Q: How to securely erase an SSD drive? I'm pretty new to SSD technology, so I don't know how it compares to hard drives when it comes to securely erasing the drive. Is it enough to run Disk Utility and erase the drive with the option \"overwrite with zeroes\", or is this designed for hard drives? Are there other actions that should be taken?\nI'm not looking for NSA-grade security though, just the kind of wipe you'd do if you're returning or selling the Mac.\n\nA: Open a terminal and type the following command:\ndf -k\n\nNote the first column corresponding to the partition of the SSD you\nwould like to irreversibly erase. Let's say it is /dev/disk1s2.\nType the following command:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk1s2 bs=100k\n\nwhere /dev/rdisk1s2 is the raw device associated with your partition\non SSD. This command will completely write this partition from 1st block\navailable to the last one. This command will last long (~1/2 h for 100 Gbytes) with no nice scroll bar of progress.\nOnce this command return you the prompt of your shell the disk has been\ncompletly and irreversibly erased.\nStart Disk Utility and check this partition.\nIt will tell you it is dammaged beyond any form of repair.\nAnd it is right.\nJust format this partition as you like.\nHere is what is happening at the physical blocks level:\n\nA: The \"Security Options...\" button in Disk Utility is currently grayed out for SSDs. According to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3680, erasing an SSD normally might be secure enough:\n\nNote: With OS X Lion and an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD. For more security, consider turning on FileVault 2 encryption when you start using the SSD drive.\n\nIt is still possible to run something like diskutil secureErase freespace 4 disk0s2 from Terminal on the recovery partition.\nSimply turning on FileVault 2 before erasing the drive is probably a better option though. According to this answer, performing a remote wipe also just erases the encryption key if FileVault 2 is enabled:\n\nYes, when you remotely wipe the computer it does a secure wipe. Apple even warns you that it could take as long as a day. However, if your drive was encrypted with FileVault 2, then it is not necessary to erase the disk. It is sufficient to securely erase the encryption key(s) stored on the disk, so that's what they do. It's very quick and as secure as the underlying encryption system is, which for now is very secure.\n\nhttp://training.apple.com/pdf/wp_osx_security.pdf:\n\nFileVault 2 provides IT departments with the ability to erase the encryption key from a given Mac at any time to ensure that encrypted data cannot be accessed by either user login or data recovery tools. This process is referred to as a remote wipe.\n\n\nA: It depends on your paranoia level. Because of the way SSDs handle writing data, doing a zero-once on an SSD is not as good as doing so on a hard drive.\nWhen you write a particular data page on an HD, the new data is simply written over the old data, replacing it. Write zeros over the whole disk and all the old data will be gone. SSDs, on the other hand, cannot simply overwrite individual pages. In order to replace the data on a page, the old data must first be erased, and SSDs cannot erase individual pages; they have to erase entire blocks consisting of many pages. \nSo what happens when you ask an SSD to overwrite, say, page #5, is that the SSD leaves the data on page #5 alone, but marks it as invalid, allocates another currently-blank page (say, #2305), writes the new data to page #2305, and makes a note that next time the OS asks for page #5 it should get #2305 instead. The original page #5 data sits there until some later time, when the drive needs more space, moves any remaining valid pages away from the block, and erases it. SSDs have more physical memory capacity than they expose to the computer, so they can juggle blocks like this for a while before actually having to erase anything (and when they do actually erase something, there's no good way to predict which blocks of leftover data will be chosen for erasure). See this AnandTech review for way more details (warning: it's fairly long, and the relevant stuff is spread around).\nNet result: if you write zeros over the \"whole\" drive, you haven't actually overwritten all the old data. You have updated the controller's translation table so it'll never return any of the old data to the OS (those pages are all invalid). But if someone's hardcore enough to bypass the controller, they could get some of your data back.\nOverwriting twice will probably work, but it depends on the controller's allocation strategy. Overwriting twice with random data (diskutil randomDisk 2 /dev/diskN) is a little more likely to work, but still not guaranteed.  Both of these also have some bad side-effects: they uses some of the lifetime of the drive, and also increase the logical fragmentation on the SSD, decreasing its write performance.\nNote that recent versions of OS X's graphical Disk Utility disable the secure erasure options on SSDs (for the reasons discussed above), but the command-line version still allows them. BTW, I have also seen several recommendations to securely erase SSDs by converting them to encrypted format, but this is (if anything) slightly less secure than overwriting with random data.\nThe best way to secure-erase an SSD is to invoke the controller's built-in secure-erase feature. This should (if the controller designers did their jobs) truly erase all blocks, and also have the side-effect of resetting the logical page map, essentially defragmenting it and restoring its original performance.  Unfortunately, most of the utilities I've seen for doing this (e.g. CMRR's HDDErase) run under DOS, which won't boot on a Mac. I did find a posting on macrumors with (rather complex) instructions for doing a secure erase from a GParted boot CD. It might also be possible to use Parted Magic from a bootable flash drive, but I have not tried this.\nResearchers at the Non-Volatile Systems Lab at UCSD have tested various ways of sanitizing SSDs by \"erasing\" the drive, then disassembling it to bypass the controller, and checking for remnant data (summary, full paper).  Their results mostly agree with what I said above (and also show that the built-in secure-erase command isn't always implemented properly):\n\nOur results lead to three conclusions:\n  First, built-in commands are effective, but manufacturers\n  sometimes implement them incorrectly. Second,\n  overwriting the entire visible address space of an SSD\n  twice is usually, but not always, sufficient to sanitize the\n  drive. Third, none of the existing hard drive-oriented\n  techniques for individual file sanitization are effective on\n  SSDs.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6278", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "39"}}

{"text": "Q: Is it possible to disable or hide the digital zoom controls in the Camera app on iPhone? I don't think I have ever used the digital zoom feature in the Camera app. The controls are just in the way when you wan't to focus something in that part of the image. So, if possible, I want to hide them. I'm not afraid to jailbreak my phone if that is what i takes. Any answer appreciated.\nI have an iPhone 3GS.\n\nA: Currently there is no officially supported method of disabling the digital zoom feature. One way around it that I use when I (rarely) need to focus on the lower screen portion, is to focus on the subject, then move the camera's view to the preferred state. The camera will preserve this focus state long enough for a picture.\n\nA: It's possible for a developer to hide them when displaying the camera interface. But there's no way for a user to turn that control off in Apple's \"Camera\" app.\n\nA: Simply instal a different camera app that's more focused (see what I did there) on experienced photographers. ProCam, for example, has an option not only to disable digital zoom, but also tells the truth about how the two lenses on the 7 Plus work, by providing direct control over which lens is active, rather than hiding the (possible, but not guaranteed) switch at 2x \"zoom\".\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6281", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: Can I install apps bought on the Mac App Store on multiple computers? If I buy an app on through the Mac App Store, can I install it on both of my Macs?\nI use the same iTunes account on both of them.\n\nA: There is no numerical limit, and you don't need to run App Store on every Mac. The App Store's own online Help document explains all this -- from App Store, open Help, then select Purchase Applications>Use Applications on Multiple Macs for details.\nThe only restriction on this is if your purchase was for commercial use and more than one person uses the apps. In that case the language of the license asks for one purchase per user or one purchase per computer.\n\nA: Yes. Just run the App Store app on the second Mac and go to the Purchases tab. You'll see a list of the apps you've already purchased, with an Install button next to each one - click the button to install on the second Mac.\n\nA: You can in fact do this. There may be a limit to the number of devices similar to how iTunes limits you to 5 \"authorized\" computers. I'm not sure though. The concept is that the computers you install them on are supposed to be your own, but the truth is there is not literally any verification process to determine this. Fortunately, Apple never makes you jump through annoying anti-piracy hoops.

Does that work for Apps too?\nNo. Apps don't check to see if you've using an iTunes-authorized Mac.\n  They can ask you to verify your Apple ID and password, but that's a\n  single check and it's just to verify you are who you say you are. Once\n  your identity is verified, that's it. There's no authorizing or\n  deauthorizing or counting of different Macs.\nDoes that mean I could buy one copy of an app and install it on every\n  Mac in my business?\nNo, the license you agree to when you enter the Mac App Store says\n  that app downloads are for Macs that you personally own, and that's a\n  license for personal use. Apps that are intended for professional use\n  are licensed for you or for a single computer used by several people.\n  While there's no technical impediment to you installing them on\n  multiple Macs at work, you'll be violating the license agreement. It's\n  the same scenario as if you buy a single-user copy of iWork and\n  install it on ten Macs at work\u2014you can do it, but you're violating the\n  license agreement, making the act ethically questionable.\n\n\nA: Apple's rules: If you buy the app for private use, then you are allowed to run the app on up to six computers that you own and control. If you buy the app for commercial use, then you are allowed to either run it on any number of computers used by the same person, or on one computer used by any number of persons. \nAnd none of these is checked by Apple. \n\nA: No, you cannot.

Last night it stopped booting up, so I reset the PRAM, and tried booting from a CD but it wouldn't fully boot.\nFinally, today I attempted to turn it on using a working power cable and there is no life whatsoever. The light goes green on the cable when I plug it in, but the power button doesn't give any life to the computer, no screen, no sound, nothing.\nI've tried booting it with the battery removed.\nWhat are my options? Is it likely to be a motherboard or RAM issue? Can I use the hard disk in another laptop to at least recover files? What is it likely to cost in repairs in the Apple store? \n\nA: Take it to an Apple Store (make an appointment first): they'll examine and diagnose it for you with no charge, and then tell you what they'd charge to fix it. \nDoesn't cost you anything and if the price is too great or you'd rather fix it yourself (now that you know the problem) then you can simply decline the service. It's a no-pressure deal, and one of the primary reasons I recommend Macs.\n\nA: You could try to drain the last energy out of the capacitors by removing the battery and the power cable, and then turn it on. Then try booting with a power cable again. If this doesn't help, there's not much you can do yourself. \nI'd guess it's a motherboard issue, with the history of dodgy power supplies that's imho more likely than RAM giving out. \nRemoving the harddisk and saving your files is indeed an option, you could look at sata-docks like this one. That way you can just take the files off instead of having to deal with booting the os on the hard drive in another laptop if you get what I mean.\nAs to the price of the repair: I have no clue at all.\n\nA: If you have a known-good power cable now, I'd try looking up \"reset PMU macbook\" and see if those instructions help at all. The PMU is a chip that governs the power management functions of the Mac, and if its settings get corrupt it could lead to a non-booting computer.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Management_Unit\n\nA: Another option you can do yourself it to reset the System Management Controller (SMC). \nThe list of power problems this can fix has enough overlap with your problems that it's likely worthwhile:\n\nPower\n  The computer doesn't respond to the power button when pressed.\n  A portable Mac doesn't appear to respond properly when you close or open the lid.\n  The computer sleeps or shuts down unexpectedly.\n  The battery does not appear to be charging properly.\n  The MagSafe power adaptor LED doesn't appear to indicate the correct activity.\n\n\nA: I am unsure that you can speak of 'bricking' your laptop in that fashion.  To me 'bricking' is a one of the dangers that may befall you if you presume to strive  for mastery over your mobile device.  \nDuring the RSS era I lost a hard drive to repeated shutdowns, but you should be fine.. have you tried mounting it as a firewire disk? Do you have access to another mac to do so?\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6314", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

That is, I want to be able to type wp Apple in the address bar, and Safari should go to the Wikipedia article on Apple. I found a Sourceforge project, SafariKeywords, which does just this, but it was last updated in 2004 and doesn't work on Intel-based Macs.\nDoes the latest version of Safari have this functionality built in and I just didn't find it, or is there something like SafariKeywords I can use, or is this just a feature I'll have to live without?\n\nA: I understand this is an older thread, but for the next person who comes along, I recommend taking a look at Safari Keyword Search. It is a Safari extension that adds exactly what you are looking for.\n\nA: I don't know if this is what you're looking, but this feature exists on Alfred. It's also on the Mac App Store. And did I mention it's free?\n\nIt's basically a spotlight replacement with a few twists. With it, you can set custom searches for any site you want:\n\nThe main advantage is that you can search from anywhere you want, you don't have to be on Safari.\n\nA: Alfred, or another app launcher is a great option.\nHowever, if you want to do this without hopping to another application, you can use a text expansion utility. That way, you type wp and it converts to http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=. Then, you just have to type in your query and hit enter. This can be done with 10.6's built-in text replacement tool.\nGo to the Language and Text System Preferences pane. Choose the Text tab. Click the plus button to create your new substitution rule.\n\nA: SafariStand is a SIMBL plugin has this feature. They call it QuickSearch.\nFor your Wikipedia example (which I also use) you would add this search:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/@key\n\nA: Omnikey, an extension for Safari does exactly this.\n\nA: I ended up installing Alfred as was suggested, and I've come to like it! But I completely understand those of you who don't want to install a Spotlight alternative. I found a Safari plugin called Keywurl which I think is exactly what I was looking for. I have not given it a try but the description fits the bill perfectly.\nAlso, if you give Keywurl a try with the latest Safari 5, you may have problems which this blog post has addressed.\n\nA: There is also an ad-blocking proxy called GlimmerBlocker that I have used to do this.

You can review these steps in case they apply in your case. Not everyone sees this speed up, but it shouldn\u2019t be hard to test and reverse if it doesn\u2019t help you. Anyone on Mojave and newer should look to other fixes like testing a backup to a blank or erased drive.\nTime Machine ridiculously slow after El Capitan upgrade\nThe throttle should be evident in observing the backupd usage of the filesystem:\nsudo fs_usage backupd\n\nWriting a command to /etc/sysctl.conf and then restarting should disable that throttle:\necho 'debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nOr without restarting:\nsudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0\n\nYou'll want to watch for other performance issues (extra CPU usage, other IO slowing, increased energy usage when backing up) after making that low level system tuning adjustment.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the solution in this case was:\nFormat disk (lose old backups)\n\nNow the disk backs up at full speed.\n\nA: According to this thread:\nDelete the \"in progress\" folder on the TM drive and then things will operate at a normal speed.\nNote: That did not fix the problem in my case.\n\nA: You could try renaming the /.Spotlight-V100 folder on the TM volume.  I've never tried this but Spotlight is used to decide which files are new/changed since the last backup.  The only thing that comes to mind in reading your question, is maybe the index is broken and needs to be rebuilt, and TM in the mean time is running that search live, rather than indexed.\nLong shot.\n\nA: It could also be related to MRT process. For me, when I removed MRT process, backup speed becomes normal. By the way, MRT is sth called malware remove tool which comes with the security update and it will take lots of CPU to do scanning work. There are some articles on how to remove it.\n\nA: Add the Time Machine disk to the Privacy list of Spotlight (in System Preferences) so that Spotlight does not spend time accessing that drive.\n\nA: Fragmentation\nIn my experience, it's very common for the catalog B-tree to become very fragmented.

Is it possible to create a wikipage in this manner on stackexchange? \n\nA: Well-built applications (hopefully including most of Apple's own apps) should be self-documenting -- Apple recommends that developers include a preference manifest inside each application that describes the preference keys they use (including their names, data types, descriptions, reasonable default values, etc).\nTo view an app's manifest, right-click (or control-click) on the app, and select Show Package Contents; then open Contents/Resources, and look for a file or folder named after the app's bundle id with a \".manifest\" suffix (e.g. Safari's is in a sub-bundle, so it's actually in Safari.app/Contents/Resources/com.apple.safari.manifest/Contents/Resources/com.apple.safari.manifest).\nThe manifest file is itself in .plist format, and may be a little hard to ready by hand, but if you look for the name values listed under <key>pfm_name</key>, you should find what you're looking for.\n\nA: As far as I know the answer to your question is \"no\".\nFor any given software you can use defaults read to get whatever options are set, but if there are default options that are not set, you won't see them.\nBlacktree Secrets is building a DB of defaults commands (which modify app plists). \n\nA: Manifest Destiny is a site used to track Manifest (option) files for apps.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6349", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

What can I do to fix it?\n\nA: This seems like a definite hardware problem.\nYou can take it to a retailer, send/take it to Apple, or do it yourself.\nHere are DIY instructions and parts ($99)\n\nA: The digitizer seemed to have been broken beyond repair so I did three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*I made a dial pad app that moved the buttons out of the damaged area. (Note that I am a registered developer at the time of this writing and was able to install this on my device sans jailbreak.)\n\n*Went to the Apple store. They said that it would be $199 to repair, but they don't do repairs anymore. The only option was to replace the phone. They refused that too because I had put in a non-Apple digitizer.\n\n*I got an upgrade to the iPhone 4. \n\nA: Aside from a hard reset or restore coming into the picture, reseating the display cabling (if you are still able to get inside) would be a good call...though if it was DIY and you weren't grounded while handling the components, then it's likely ESD damage catching up to you.\nAn unauthorized repair would put the unit out of warranty, regardless of its status, so an Apple Store is always available for service at a cost.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6403", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}
{"text": "Q: Is there a standard delay for consumer ratings of apps on the App Store? I have an app that's been out for a couple of weeks. Its not exactly selling like hot cakes yet, but I'm pretty sure I've gotten a rating or a review by now. But nothing shows when viewing either in iTunes or directly on the AppStore on the iPhone.\nIs there a standard delay as to when ratings/reviews show up, that Apple imposes, especially for new apps? Or do you think there is some problem with Apple's system?\n\nA: My experience is there is a fairly big delay in reviews showing up - but I would expect even the first review to get published within a month of posting should other ratings and reviews arrive for that app to separate it from an app that has less than 100 downloads ever.\nI don't know for sure, but the ratings seem to be held back until 10 or 20 are submitted. Once you reach that limit the store will show the overall rating and only new versions get ratings once they hit their threshold (but a message stating not enough ratings are in to show).\nIt makes sense for users to expect a few points before any app gets zero or five stars and makes the ratings a useful measure that some handful of people expressed an opinion before they are shown.\nAfter hearing about the delays, I've sometimes checked and my experience with about 50 reviews where I cared to check back, the shortest time was about 24 hours and the longest was 2 weeks for a review to appear. I've not had one not eventually get published, but I also don't generally review apps that have hundreds of reviews which is much harder to find your needle in the haystack of other reviews. I generally star those apps or write something and not bother to check if it ever made it live.\n\nA: From a users standpoint, you only see reviews from the app store/country you are logged into. I have accounts on the China, US and NZ app stores, and notice significantly more reviews on the American and Chinese sites than the NZ one (unsurprisingly I might add). Perhaps you are logged in to an app store with less users/less likely to have reviews?\nMaybe you can link us to you app so we can have a look at it. Good luck.\n\nA: All these answers seem well enough, but I've made shining, 5 star reviews in the past (in America, with games I've bought and am logged into) that have yet to appear.  In the meantime, the illiterate smeghead who's dropped F-bombs every other word... he has 19 reviews showing, all made in the last 2 weeks.\nI am more willing to believe that they're just waiting for a grouping of reviews, rather than reviewing reviews for viewable content.\nIt all seems disorganized to me.  I don't think the employess hired to improve this process have any real idea what they're doing.\n\nA: I know that they wait for a set number of ratings before displaying, and I imagine that reviews are subject to moderation.\nThese things might be especially true for new apps/developers.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6405", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: How does the quality of the LED-backlit screen of a MacBook or a 27\" Cinema Display degrade over time? The quality of my PowerBook and 20\" Cinema Display screens has degraded over time, they became noticeably yellowish and darker due to the wear of the backlight (I assume). Neither of those screens is LED-backlit. I'm wondering, how do the LED-backlit screens used in current Apple products degrade over time? Do they similarly become yellowish, give less light, ...? How long does it take for the effect to become obvious, or what's the expected life time of these screens?\n\nA: This Engadget article shows photos of a direct comparison:\n\nStanding in front of the white-LED backlight on the new MBP, it's immediately apparent how crisp the whites are -- it's very noticeable after staring into CCFL LCDs all day long. But even though the whites were whiter, the screen didn't necessarily seem a lot brighter, which is probably where some amount of CCFL dimming on our test MBP came into play in creating the dramatic difference we saw. Viewing angles were very similar on both machines, but as you'll notice, at half brightness it's the LED backlit MBP that's dimmer, and the CCFL display that's actually brighter. Interesting stuff.\n\nAlso interesting could be the Advantages and Disadvantages sections of the Wikipedia article on LEDs (link):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Slow failure: LEDs mostly fail by dimming over time, rather than the abrupt failure of incandescent bulbs.\n  \n*Lifetime: LEDs can have a relatively long useful life. One report estimates 35,000 to 50,000 hours of useful life, though time to complete failure may be longer. Fluorescent tubes typically are rated at about 10,000 to 15,000 hours, depending partly on the conditions of use, and incandescent light bulbs at 1,000\u20132,000 hours.\n  \n\n\nA: I've had my 2007 MBP17 backlights replaced a couple times. \nWith that model, you could place downward pressure on the closed device. That apparently causes blobby regions of the backlight to appear overtly grayer. I carried my MBP17 in a padded backpack with stuff in it that compressed the unit while carrying. Whoops.\nAnother failure mode I saw was the backlighting dimmed in largely vertical areas; text over at the top-left of the panel and below over time became harder to read. The effect is considerably less obvious than the first problem.\n(Normally, the screen center looks brightest and the edges look a little dimmer, but I can see the left side of the screen as brightly as the center by moving my head to the left. When it doesn't seem a little brighter by doing that, you may have a backlight issue.) \nThere may be other failure modes, these are the ones I've seen. For me, the degradation is slow and involved areas of the backlight becoming less bright.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6420", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

I have a Mac Pro from late 2007, early 2008 and I want to perform a clean install but nothing comes up on my monitor. The graphics card is an NVIDIA GT 120 and the hard drive is an Intel SSD. I am assuming the graphics card is the problem but all comments point to it being supported. \nHow do I do a clean Snow Leopard install with the given hardware?\n\nA: The Apple NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 Graphics card is not compatible with the 2007/2008 Mac Pro, so in order to do the fresh install you will want to remove the GT 120 and re-install a compatible graphics card that will work with the 2007 / 2008 generation of Mac Pro.\nAs noted on Amazon the following system requirements are noted for the Apple NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 Graphics card.\n\nProduct Features\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Requires Mac Pro (Early 2009 with 1066MHz DDR3 memory) with PCI Express 2.0 slot\n  \n*Requires Mac OS X v10.5.6 or later\n  \n\n\nA: You have to keep the stock video card in the first slot, and the new one in the second slot, then OS X should boot because it senses the EFI patched video card and allows you to see it.\n\nA: If you have reset the NVRAM to clear the device tree and let the mac have the best chance to run the installer, you still have some options to resolve this.\n\n\n*\n\n*A newer retail OS X DVD should\nhave the original and updated\ndrivers to drive that monitor\n(making a failure more likely\nhardware and less of a driver\nquestion) than the DVD that originally shipped with that model.\n\n*Taking the drive (or the whole Mac) to a shop that has all the boot images and several retail OS DVD on hand might be needed.\n\n\nDeployStudio running on another mac has saved my day more times than I can count.

Is there any other way to empty trash the USB drive? \n\nA: I don't know wether it's the best answer, but at least it's working answer.\nOpen the command line, cd to the USB volume (/Volumes/USB for my case), and type:\n/bin/rm -rf ./Trashes/* works fine with me.\n\n\nA: It's possible that there are files in some other user's trash.  The .Trashes folder at the top of each volume has subfolders for each different user, by user ID number (e.g. user 502's trash is in .Trashes/502).\nYou can see if it for yourself using a command like this (replace VolumeName with your drive name):\nls -la /Volumes/VolumeName/.Trashes/\ntotal 0\nd-wx-wx-wt@  3 _unknown  _unknown   102 10 Feb 18:15 .\ndrwxrwxrwx@ 21 root      wheel      782 13 Feb 14:17 ..\ndrwx------@ 35 _unknown  _unknown  1190 13 Feb 14:18 502\n\nNote: you might get a permissions error from this command, either because the .Trashes folder doesn't allow read access (solve this by adding sudo, e.g. sudo ls -ls ..., and entering your admin password when requested); and/or because of the privacy protections in macOS Mojave (10.14) and later (solve this by granting the Terminal access in System Preferences > Security & Privacy pane > Privacy tab > Full Disk Access category, see here for more details).\nAs you can see, on my USB disk .Trashes folder there's a sub foder called 502, owned by user ID 502 (for reference, my current user ID is 501). Since this user doesn't exist on my system, I see it as _unknown, and my user can't look inside of it, neither delete it.  To look inside that folder we need to do it as administrator (i.e. use sudo).\nIf you are sure that you want to, you can delete everyone's trash by deleting the entire .Trashes folder with a command like:\nsudo rm -R /Volumes/volumeName/.Trashes\n\nWarning: as with anything involving sudo (\"do as super user\", i.e. system administrator) and rm -R, use this carefully.

Then, you can empty the trash. It will really delete them from that drive.\nIf that isn't happening for you, here's my suggestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the drive in your Finder sidebar. \n\n*Without selecting anything else, press cmd-i (or use menu item File \u2192 Get Info). \n\n*Use the Sharing and Permissions section of that window to give Everyone the permissions to Read and Write.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6434", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "46"}}

Square Trade is available only in the United States and Canada.\nFor accidental damage plus theft (not clear if it covers standard warranty-type damage) I've heard some good about Safeware.

{"text": "Q: How to set a Monospace Font for Dashboard Sticky Notes Widget? I would like to use a monospaced font on the Sticky Notes in Apple's Dashboard widget.\nHowever, only a few fonts can be selected, none of which is monospaced.\n\nA: This is possible, because widgets are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based. Here's how:\nFirst, go to /Library/Widgets and find the Stickies one. Copy it to ~/Library/Widgets and name it myStickies (or something else).\nClose the Stickies widget in Dashboard.\nNow, go to the myStickies.wdgt version you copied and right-click it. Choose Show Package Contents.\nIn the new window that appears, right-click on the Stickies.js file and open it with your favorite JavaScript editor (if you don't have one, TextWrangler is great and free).\nNow, use the editor to find the line var fontArray = new Array; (should be around line 407). You'll see below that line a bunch of lines similar to each other, saying something like fontArray[\"font name\"] = 1,. You want to copy the last one of those (American Typewriter), and paste it back below itself. Then, change it so it looks like this: fontArray[\"Courier New\"] = 8;\nSave and close this file.\nNow, open (from the same folder) Stickies.html in an HTML editor (TextWrangler works).\nFind the line that says, <select id='font-popup' class='popup' onchange='fontchanged(this);'> (should be about line 40).\nBelow that, you'll find a bunch of lines similar to each other, each beginning with <option value. Copy the one for Gill Sans, and paste it below itself.\nEdit it to say <option value =\"Courier New\">Courier New</option>.\nSave and close this file.\nOpen Terminal and type killall Dock. This restarts Dashboard.\nNow, double click the myStickies widget file you made. It will open in Dashboard. Follow the normal procedure of clicking the i and changing the font. You'll have a Courier option, and it will be that font.

{"text": "Q: Why does my Exchange account work on my iPhone, but not Mail.app? I can set up my work Exchange account just fine on my iPhone, but I can't get it to work on Mail.app under Snow Leopard.\nI have read some forums and understand that mobile devices use ActiveSync in order to access Exchange mail and I thought Snow Leopard introduced this feature to Mail, but I can't seem to get it working.\nI have tried just about every combination of settings I can think of.\nMy iPhone asks for a domain, but I can't find a similar setting in Mail. I have tried entering my username as domain/username to no avail.\nHas anyone had experience/similar problems with this?\n\nA: Most likely because your corporate exchange server is running Microsoft Exchange Server 2003. Snow Leopard now only connects to Exchange 2007 (See http://www.apple.com/macosx/exchange/) whereas Leopard used to connect to Exchange 2003 using the OWA mechanism.\niPhone supports both Exchange 2003, 2007 and 2010 it seems (See iPhone User Guide , page 2);\n\nA: I'd been struggling with the same issue for over a year. Finally I installed DavMail Gateway which is free. \nIt provides support for Exchange 2003 ( using OWA ). Using it you can even get support for LDAP directory services & even events in iCal!!\nSee page for details. Step-by-step instructions on:\nSetting up DavMail on OS X\nIMAP Mail setup\n\nA: Have you tried everything listed in this Apple doc?\n\nA: Try domain\\username. I've never seen a forward slash work to indicate a domain. Then again, I've never tried. Do you get any error messages?\n\nA: I've been having this problem with Exchange Server 2003 and Mail under Snow Leopard, and it's because the IMAP process on the server periodically dies.  This affects the Mail app on the computer and not the iPhone because, as another answer here mentions, the iPhone uses ActiveSync, while the Mail app on the computer relies on IMAP if it's not Exchange 2007 or newer.  Someone needs to log into the server and restart it.\nOne possible fix is here.\n\nA: AFAIK: Snow Leopard supports Exchange via Web Services (new in Exchange 2007). All mobile devices use ActiveSync (which is basically XML over long lived HTTPS sessions).\nUsing IMAP to check email on Exchange is fine (if enabled on server) but you lose calendar and contacts sync.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6457", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}

{"text": "Q: Is it really true that the iPhone doesn't have turn-by-turn navigation? I'm looking into getting a new Verizon smartphone. I like many things about the iPhone, but I'm concerned that I'll have to give up a feature I really like about my current phone--turn-by-turn navigation. According to this skattertech chart, the iPhone lacks this feature. Is there really not an \"app for that\"? (And if not, why? The phone has GPS, so what gives?)\n\nA: There are plenty of apps for that, especially in the US (where I'm not). There are the apps that mankoff suggests (I use TomTom here in NZ), but I think he left out the best value option: MotionX GPS Drive - they actually do a bunch of different applications, and all great value. Check them out.\nBTW, what phone are you using at the moment? What app are you most familiar with?\n\nA: There is an app for that. Look in the App Store. I think the going rate for the GPS apps (Navigon, TomTom, etc.) is about $50 USD.\nThe built-in Google Maps app does have turn-by-turn (it lists the turns you need to take), but it does not have a voice, and it does not recognize when you have deviated from the suggested route and then re-program itself.\n\nA: The thing is that the built-in Maps app uses Google Maps for the maps, and the Google Maps license doesn't allow a third-party to implement voice navigation using it. \nSo, Apple's Maps isn't allowed to implement voice navigation, but any other GPS software provider can offer the feature along with their own maps.\nHere is a nice review of some of the GPS software available for the iPhone: http://www.macworld.com/article/156720/2011/01/gps.html\nAlso, that situation could change, since Apple purchased a maps company a few years ago.\n\nA: The $50+ GPS apps usually include the maps in the download while the free/cheap ones download pieces of the map as required.  This is an issue if you are going to drive in areas with poor data coverage.  It's not a happy moment when your GSP doesn't have the necessary map section nd there's no reception to get it.  On the other hand, apps like TomTom (which I use) are huge (1.2GB) since they include the map so it takes up a pretty big chunk of space on your phone.\nWaze is a pretty fun app but is intended to help with local driving more than trip-based navigation.  Map accuracy is crowd-sourced so the quality is wildly variable and the routing software isn't designed for long-trips.  But it's a lot of fun to use.\nLive traffic usually requires a fee but it varies from product to product.\nAll the apps suck your battery dry at an alarming rate.  Power in the car is an absolute necessity.\n\nA: Yes its true no turn by turn navigation from Apple on the iPhone, etc. However, there are many good free solutions out there and paid as well. One free solution that work currently best for local area navigation is the free Waze gps app. Works good for local under 1 hour trips and provides free traffic re routing too. Has an interesting community aka social networking aspect to it as well. Just note that with this app you are best off copying address from the maps app to Waze to best begin navigation.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6472", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: Can anyone recommend an app for creating flowcharts and diagrams? I'm seeking a Mac app for creating basic flowcharts and similar diagrams. \nGoogle has been no help; I've followed dozens of links to apps that either don't exist anymore, I can't find any real reviews of, or that won't run on OS X 10.6.6.\nWhat I'd really like:\n\n\n*\n\n*A simple and clean interface\n\n*Basic shapes\n\n*Automated connectors that stay linked as you move shapes around\n\n*Inexpensive, preferably under $30 but definitely under $50\nWhat I'm not looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hundreds of shapes \n\n*Default styles that have shadows and textures and such that I have to keep removing\n\n*Dozens of amazing features that allow you to automatically map databases and draw UML diagrams from code and such (I'm looking at you, Visio) that I have to constantly navigate around to make a few basic diagrams\n\n*A mind-mapping app with all the features such a thing entails, one that happens to also let you make basic diagrams\n\n*A full-fledged drawing app where, once again, I have to maneuver around a whole bunch of features and options to get to the basic functions I need.  (I have Illustrator, I love Illustrator, but it's crap for basic flowcharts and other simple diagrams.)\nI wouldn't actually use it for flowcharts, but rather basic similar diagrams to show data flow between apps, information flow in a company or other places, that kind of thing.\nI recently found out that the drawing portion of Google Docs actually does a pretty good job with the types of diagrams I need to create, but the UI is pretty poor and it obviously requires a constant net connection.\n\nA: For free online diagramming there's diagrams.net, which I am a developer on. It supports the automatic connection and dragging of components you're looking for. Also, it's free (and open source), which meets your under $30 requirement.\nThere is also a Desktop version available.\n\nA: I know this is an older thread, but I would like to throw in my $.02 (since things have changed some since this was posted). Lucid Chart for Google Apps is a viable solution. It is free for basic diagramming, and there are very reasonable pricing for more advanced features. It even has the capability to open (and save) Visio documents. It is integrated with Google Drive (for personal OR Apps Domains) and is real-time collaborative. Google Docs, of course, has a Drawing tool, but Lucid expands on it with some drag-n-drop features and other more advanced tools you would expect from fat-client apps. more information can be found on their website but if you search in the Chrome Web Store, you will find it and can install it directly from there. At that point it is as simple as logging into Google Drive and clicking Create and selecting Lucid Chart as the document type.\n\nA: Apple's Keynote may primarily be for presentations, but its diagramming tools also hit all your requirements: simple interface; polygons of arbitrary number of sides; connection lines (select two shapes, right click, \"Add Connection Line\"); cost of USD$20.\nAs a bonus, you'll have great presentation software to show off your cool new diagrams.\n\nA: Take a look at the free and simple to use yEd, I believe this would fit about right for your 2 yr old question :)  \n\nA: If you can stretch your budget, get OmniGraffle for Mac. At $149, it's pricier than you'd like (do you possibly qualify for the $89.99 edu price?), but it's exactly what you're looking for.\nOn the lower end there's Mindcad Incubator for $10.99, but I haven't tried it myself and I'm not sure it does everything you want.\n\nA: Would MindNode fit what you're looking for?\nThere's a free version and and $20 version available. They're both on the Mac App Store.\n\nA: I love Gliffy. It's free and very user-friendly.\n\nA: You also have several proposals from another SO thread here.\nOmniGraffle won the competition but the other links are quite interesting and could fit your needs.\n\nA: Give Xmind a try. It's Java, so expect a Java applications\u2026 if you know what that means.\nBut given that you haven't found OmniGraffle very \"attractive\" for you, you might want to give it a try.\n\nA: There is new diagramming tool Diagrammix in the Mac App Store. Simple and beautiful. \n\nA: I see you that you need to draw flowchart with basic shapes and grids. I would recommend a web based solution since you are not always using it. But if you are drawing flowcharts frequently I suggest you to get an flowchart software like Creately. There is a mac version available and you can try for free \n\n\n*\n\n*Creately has an improved interface  and I can assure you that it is very user friendly powerful and simple.\n\n*Yes, Creately supports 1000's shapes since there are more than 50 diagrams types made available to use. And you can customize to use the ones you want to use frequently as well.\n\n*Creately has what you call (smart connectors) that can automatically connect shapes by identifying the position of the shape and the connector type it requires.\n\n*You can edit change / add different styles and improve your diagrams with creately as you want. \n\n*Its a fully fledged diagram designing application made for diagramming mainly focused on the design and use. It has specific features for each diagram type.\n\n*Perfection is the word for the diagrams you design from creately. Further more there are many templates and examples to be used to create instant diagrams.\n\n*Price is under 50$ as you mentioned and the whole package is worth it. You can always try be for you buy.  \n\nA: You can take a look at MyDraw (https://www.mydraw.com), which has versions for Mac and Windows. It costs 69USD and is in your budget. MyDraw has thousands of shapes for different diagramming scenarios (flowcharts, OrgCharts, UML, mindmaps etc.) and is packed with enterprise features like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Import and export to Microsoft Visio.  \n\n*Highly interactive, fast and modern User Interface that is Visio like.\n\n*Support for embedding barcodes (and soon charts, gauges and tables) in drawings.\n\n*Export to vector formats like SVG, PDF, WMF and DXF (Autocad).\n\n*Export to raster formats like BMP, PNG, JPEG and other.\n\n\n\nDisclosure: I work for Nevron\n\nA: The Google Docs suite of tools now has a diagramming tool that lets you create flowcharts. While not as feature rich as something like OmniGraffle, it does cover all your requirements: simple & clean interface, basic shapes (and not an overabundance of shapes), automatic connectors with elasticity, and it meets your price point at free.\nCertainly can't hurt to try it out before you drop $100 on the Mac Daddy of diagramming programs for Mac.\nEdit: just noticed your last paragraph in your question. Not much I can do about the UI, but I will mention that offline support is about to make a return via Chrome.\n\nA: I found another one. Seems to meet all your prerequisites.\nShapes\n\nShapes is a simple, elegant Graphing and Diagramming app for Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Shapes gives you all of the most important features you need in a Diagramming tool without all the extra cruft, and without breaking the bank.\n\n\nA: Dia is pretty useful. From the description: \"Dia is a program to draw structured diagrams\". Available for Linux, Windows, OS X.\n\nA: GraphViz\nThe link above is to a GUI wrapper to the command line utility. With GraphViz, layout is automated, so you don't get to choose exactly where the nodes end up, although you can provide hints and have some limited control.\nRegarding your other points:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is CLI, so I think that counts as a simple and clean interface\n\n*Basic shapes are provided\n\n*Connectors are automated and will stay linked (although you can't move shapes with a mouse).\n\n*Free.\n\n\nA: I'm late to the party, but NeoOffice's drawing tool meets your four criteria.\n\n\nA: How about pencil? This is for fast prototyping.\n\nA: iPlotz\n\niPlotz allows you to rapidly create clickable, navigable mockups and wireframes for prototyping websites and software applications.\nCreate a project, add wireframe pages with design components and discuss your creations with others.\n\n\nA: IHMC CmapTools is very good. You have to register for it but it is free to use and can run on all major OSes.\n\nA: Your best solution is probably Inspiration. There's a free trial version available you can try out.\n\nA: Since what you're asking for is an extremely simple to use program without advanced features and lots of shapes, I suggest Delinieato, available through the Mac App store. Delineato gets ideas out of your head and onto the screen with a few clicks. It includes specifically the features you asked for, simple shapes, easy to use connectors, connectors that flow with the shapes as you move them around the screen. Delineato also has an infinite sized canvas, allowing you to shift things around and expand ideas as neccessary.\nBest of all, it's under $10 on the App Store for the full version.\n\nA: Well, I read all the posts and tried several of these apps, as I was also looking for a flowchart tool.\nGo for Pencil (thanks Sangcheol Choi) It's amazing yet simple. Yes, it has a lot of shapes, but it also has a very intuitive search tool, and the MEANING of each of them, which many other apps don't have.... Sometimes, that's very useful, at least for people who do not deal with flowcharts every day, so we are not sure about the meaning of some less used shapes....\n\nA: Lovely Charts:\nA diagramming application that allows you to create professional looking diagrams of all kinds, such as flowcharts, sitemaps, business processes, organisation charts, wireframes and many more....\nA cross-platform desktop application that is available for Linux, Mac & Windows, as well as an online edition & iPad edition compliments its versatility.\nThis is a Premium application and the price varies depending upon which version who choose to purchase.\n\nA: I'm really liking Gliffy. I'm a long-time user of Graffle and have tried a number of the other suggestions on this page. Graffle is great except for one crucial, deal-killing problem - it's orthogonal connecting line algorithm is terrible. I have to manually redraw lines almost anytime I move anything.\nGliffy is completely intuitive - everything pretty much does what I expect it to, and there are nice keyboard shortcuts for most things. I'd like to see symmetrical resizing (hold down option like in Graffle) so I don't have to re-center every time I resize a box, but that's a niggle.\nThe one feature I'd really like that none of these programs seems to have is the ability to expand or collapse a process block to reveal the flowchart of what's in the box. MacFlow under Mac OS9 used to do this, and it was wonderful: double-click a box and a new page would open, where you could flowchart the \"nested\" process. Close that window and the chart is hidden, but still there underneath whenever needed. Boxes with nested flowcharts had a bold border around them to let you know.\n\nA: The ProcessOn diagram platform is completely free, and includes a drawing application that is actually fairly useable for creating diagrams and flowcharts at the simpler end of the scale.\n\nA: Try Describio (https://www.describio.com). You can create runnable flowcharts using either the user interface or JavaScript (if you know how to code). You can also use user inputs to help control the flow. It's a more-advanced tool, but it's very useful for creating working prototypes. Check it out!\n\nA: Why does nobody mention the excellent diagramming app - ConceptDraw?\nIf you're familiar with Microsoft Visio, this one is absolutely your choice. The only one problem is that it's more expensive than what you expect.\nHope you can have a trial and consider my recommendation.\n\nA: You can actually do a lot of flowcharting stuff with Google Docs too. It depends on whether you're willing to pay for something or not. There's a good mix of both paid and free flowcharting software on Mac here.\n\nA: You can try Edraw Flowchart for Mac. It's an all-purpose diagram software with all flowcharting shapes. I suggest it to you because I found it one of the greatest diagramming tools after I tried some. It has a simple and elegant interface that you will feel comfortable to work on. It also includes templates that you can choose from. If you are a student, you just pay half price.

Press and hold on the icon for the video you wish to move to your computer and select copy from the pop-up menu that appears.\nStill on your iPhone open Mail and create a new message. In the body of the message, press and hold the cursor, and select paste from the pop-up menu.

You may hit your attachment limit very quickly depending on length and resolution.\n\nA: Use the Dropbox app. This lets you sync a large video wirelessly without worrying about file-size limits imposed by other messaging techniques (like email).\n\nA: You can transfer video from iPhone to Mac in 3 different ways:\n1. transfer over cloud servers\n2. transfer over LAN\n3. transfer over WiFi\nThis iPhone file manager app can help you transfer files from iPhone to Mac by using above 3 ways easily: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifile-pocket/id690442933?mt=8\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6499", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}
{"text": "Q: How do split panes in Terminal work? I tried to open a split pane to run another command but instead it displays the same in both panes and I can only interact with one of them. I thought it would split the view so I could use the two panes independently like two windows.\nI have the Visor installed but I don't think it would interfere.\nTerminal - version 2.1.1\nVisor custom (84d1873) based on 1.5\n\n\nA: It's meant to be like that. See this Super User answer:\n\nYou're misinterpreting the feature. It's not meant for two separate\n  terminals. It's intended to allow a\n  user to see two different view points\n  in the same terminal. For instance, if\n  you have 3000 files in a directory,\n  and you perform an ls command, that\n  output is going to be very long.\nIf you use the split pane, you can\n  scroll through that long output\n  without having to flip back and forth,\n  possibly losing your place along the\n  way.\nIf you want two terminals, use tabs,\n  or separate windows.\n\nI would add that, for two separate terminals, you can use separate tabs as well.\n\nA: You should really have a look at screen (that\u00b4s an already installed command line tool, not a separate application), which gives you the ability to split your Terminal into two (or more) separate ones.

{"text": "Q: Use internal speakers with others plugged into headphones jack I have a set of surround speakers, connected to my iMac through the headphone jack. I use a switch to control what goes to the speaker set (iMac, iPod, or MacBook/aux). So that I don't have to be constantly unplugging and replugging, I leave the audio cable in the iMac's audio port. This means that when I'm listening to something from another source, I can't hear anything from the iMac unless I unplug the cable.\nIs there a way to force sound to come out of the internal speakers, even if there's something in the audio out port?\n\nA: There is a way to do this but it is difficult and probably not for every user. What happened is Apple does have a \"hardware\" switch built in, which sends a signal to disable/enable the internal speaker. Because Windows or other OS simply doesn't have such function built in, it will just be a weird signal that does nothing.\nOption 1\nI cannot disable this signal, it probably requires some highly skilled kext modifier, but I found a way to reset the internal speaker after it gets disabled. It will not stick after a reboot, so you have to do it every time after the booting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your AppleHDA.kext in /System/Library/Extensions/\n\n*Show package content of this file, go to Contents/Plugins then remove AppleHDAHALPlugIn.bundle.\n\n*Reload the kext by running\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\nsudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\nps aux | grep 'coreaudio[d]' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs sudo kill\n\n\n*Recover the backup file AppleHDA.kext (or your computer won't boot next time you reboot).\nNote, if you unplug the headphone, it will still show in your audio device panel. Tested working on a retina iMac. Not working on a retina Macbook (no audio afterward).\n\nOption 2\nI have a better way to do this (this method no longer works for 10.12.x+).\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the following files:\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!js4gmZbI!xNFCxGT5zPYCS8RLtxk4xZQxNk0oP2sH8RjXbBqgmE0\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!ulw13BzD!Y1k564bTSxZrePpPL-si5h65XULwnYeEMwH-l0lSLfI\n\n*Open up the first download, and drag the second download into it. It will take 10 minutes to install. Then restart your system.\nYou will not have line out and internal speakers both in your sound panel at all time, even when your headphone is not plugged in.\nTested on macOS 10.11, iMac Retina and not working on MacBook Pro Retina.\n\nA: Pretty sure it can't be done with the built-in headphone jack. What you could try is getting a USB soundcard (one example, but there are lots out there for $20 or so) to plug your headphones into. That should give you two options in the sound preferences.\nPS, if you option-click the speaker icon in the menu bar, you get a quicker way to swap inputs/outputs than going to the sound preference pane every time.\n\nA: Just found a solution that works or me - I use an HDTV as an additional monitor, and with headphones plugged in there I can route the audio to the external monitor. I can now switch between iMac speakers and headphones without unplugging the headphones.\n\nA: I have been trying to get this to work. After moving from my Mac Pro which has speakers and headphones plugged in and I simple switched between them (and even internal speakers) to a new iMac where I have to keep unplugging the headphones to get sound through the iMac speakers. What I'm about to order is a simple USB Sound Card dongle. Small thing that gives an audio jack via a usb, this should then allow me to alt+click the volume icon and switch between built in and headphones as it will see them as separate outputs.\n\nA: There's no supported way to override the switch that deactivates the internal speakers when a headphone jack is detected on 2011 through 2015 era hardware. The answer on modifying kernel extensions is amazing though if you like experimenting.\nThe switch that detects whether a 3.5mm headphone jack or mini-toslink is inserted removes the internal speaker from the sound control panel. (Probably at a low enough level that the OS itself cannot over-ride this control.)\nSince there isn't a widely known firmware hack, OS hack or hidden preference to disable this detection, you will need to add a USB to headphone device to avoid losing your internal speaker option while a headphone is plugged in.\n\n*\n\n*Griffin iMic\nAs long as you don't plug into the Apple port, you can switch amongst the internal and all other output sources using the normal tools (or whatever third party software option you prefer)\n\nA: I use Boot Camp to run Windows 7 on my iMac 27\" mid-2011.  When in the Windows mode I have the choice of internal speakers or headphone jack in my audio output, even although I the headphones permanently plugged into the headphone jack.  So Windows have it solved  how come Mac can't - after all it's all the same hardware!\n\nA: You can upgrade to a more recent Mac model. Later Macs that come with the Apple T2 chip treat the headphone jack and the internal speakers as separate devices. For a list of Macs with T2 chip, see the support article \u201cMac models with the Apple T2 Security Chip.\u201d\nMacs with M1 chip can also use the 3.5mm headphone jack and built-in speakers simultaneously.\n\n\nA: You can change the audio (output and input) directly on the Sounds Preference panel.   There's an output tab that includes a selector for selecting the output.\n\nIf you want something a bit more convenient I used a free program called Audio Switcher from Spike Software.  It sits in the task tray and offers quick access to the same settings you see in the Sound Preferences pane.\n\nA: A faster way to do what @rwr suggested is to option click on the audio icon in the menu bar and select Internal Speakers under Output.\n\n\nA: The switch that is used is hardware based, so no way to override it except with an audio USB device, or: bluetooth speakers!\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6510", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "41"}}

For example:\n\nPerpetua:2011-01-16 ashley$ xattr -l IMAG0107.jpg \ncom.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment:\n00000000  62 70 6C 69 73 74 30 30 50 08 00 00 00 00 00 00  |bplist00P.......|\n00000010  01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000020  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 09                    |..........|\n0000002a\nPerpetua:2011-01-16 ashley$ \n\n\nBut this isn't the attribute I want to edit.  I imagine this is because kMDItemComment is an iPhoto-specific piece of metadata.  My question would be, how do I go about editing it?\n\nA: com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment is in binary property list format. Using xattr -p -l -x | tail +2 gives you just the hex dump of the attribute. You can then pipe that into xxd -r to turn that back into a binary file.\nFrom there you can open that file in Apple's Property List Editor, assuming you have the Developer Tools installed. You can then edit the property visually.\nYou should then be able to reapply the edited value to the file using xxd -p -x and xattr -w -x.\nThis is all much more messy than one really wants for a single property that's just a string.\n\nA: One can do this in the \"Mac\" way (by AppleScript), using the following script setFinderComment.scpt\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\non run argv\n    set filePath to POSIX file (item 1 of argv)\n    set fileComment to item 2 of argv\n    set theFile to filePath as alias\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set comment of theFile to fileComment\nend run\n\nThen you make it executable chmod a+x setFinderComment.scpt and use as\nsetFinderComment.scpt filename comment\n\n\nA: The OpenMeta project is using the extended attributes to store their tags. The source code is available at https://code.google.com/p/openmeta/. Part of that project are open meta command line tools. \nThis command line tool does operate on pre-defined set of attributes used by OpenMeta, but as it is open source, it can be easily adapted to allow additional command line setting for setting/reading other extended attribute.\nNot direct solution, but a path to a solution ?\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6525", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

From vim's \"direct\" mode, :mksession path/to/sessionfile will create it. Sourcing it later from the command-line is simple: vim -S path/to/sessionfile.\nThere's a great plugin called VCS, that handles my SVN stuff:\n\n...CVS, SVN, SVK, git, bzr, and hg within VIM, including committing changes and performing diffs...\n\nUpload to server functionality is handled by the netrw plugin.\nvim does have a steep learning curve, the vimtutor, which comes with the app, can help jump-start you. Also, there are active users here and on SO's sister sites, plus on the vim IRC node on freenode.net.\nProbably the most awesome thing about vim, is its available in an interfaced version on Mac OS as MacVim, on Linux using gvim, on Windows, and from the command-line of any of those OSes. vim on any of them will use the same commands, same plugins, same themes, etc., within the limitations of those environments. I bounce back and forth from Mac to Linux all day long and have at least one vim window open somewhere. \nAnd, lest anyone think I'm not familiar with the Mac-only alternatives, I own all my copies of Coda, BBEdit and TextMate, and use them. I go way back with BBEdit, and actually used to occasionally demo it at MacWorld. It's great, but I use vim with the same settings everywhere, and none of the other editors can do that. So, if you need that cross-platform compatibility, look into it.\n\nA: i'd go with Fraise, which used to be Smultron. works with very many languages and has a minimalist interface. syntax highlighting.\n\nA: Beyond up-voting @philip's BBedit recommendation, I am compelled to emphatically endorse BBEIT: BBEdit Simply the best coding editor I've used PC or Mac. I've not used VIM but I've been coding since before DOS existed, so I understand the speed of all-keyboard-all-the-time editing. I'll give you that and yet stand by my BBEdit endorsement.\nP.S. Did I mention I like BBEdit?\n\nA: I'd second the recommendations for Sublime Text and the JetBrains products (I use WebStorm extensively in my job). If you want something free, atom is well worth a look. It's fairly bare-bones, but has a wide selection of plugins that should encompass what you need.\n\nA: It has been mentioned, but only in passing:\nAtom (https://atom.io/) is open source and developed by GitHub. Integration with github is superb and it is particularly interesting these days since there is a lot of development with new features and new ideas regularly. I think it will cover your whole list of requirements through extensions (packages - https://atom.io/packages).\n\nA: For me Jetbrains PHP-Storm is simply the best & most complete IDE!\nIt has a lot of good and usefull features though it stays simple to handle and setup.\nIt's available for Linux, OSX and Windows. .\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*PhP 5.x \n\n*Javascript (JSLint, JSHint code hints)\n\n*HTML/CSS/SCSS/SASS\n\n*Lua, Perl and Python plugins do exist.

I'd like to have the airport extreme join the wireless network and share the connection to the ethernet ports.\nCan anyone provide some assistance on the best way to configure to do this?\nThanks!\n\nA: Here's what ended up working, via: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2725432&tstart=0\nThe following are the basic steps to configure a \"dynamic\" WDS with the 802.11n AirPort Express Base Station (AXn) being extended by the 802.11n AirPort Extreme Base Station (AEBSn). Please compare them to what you attempted to see if anything was missed.\nOne thing to note is that the AXn is not capable of providing simultaneous dual-band operation like the AEBSn. That said, you will only be able to extend the 2.4 OR the 5 GHz radio of the AXn. Since the lower frequency band travels longer distances, I would suggest extending it.\no If practical, place the base stations in near proximity to each other during the setup phase.

I don't mind having to reinstall the entire operating system if necessary.\nCould this same method also be used if I upgrade to OS X Lion (OS X 10.7)?\nThe reason I'm asking is because I heard that OS X 10.6.6 removed support for installing boot camp using a Vista CD, and that's all I have. Thus, if I ever want to wipe my computer and reinstall everything, I want to be able to still use a Vista CD to install boot camp.\n\nA: You can reinstall the OS back to the same version that it shipped with by using the restore discs that came with your Mac to wipe your disk and reinstall Mac OS X.\nHowever, just because Apple has officially dropped support for XP and Vista with Boot Camp doesn't mean it will stop working - the most likely situation will be that new computers will have hardware that Apple will only provide Windows 7 drivers for.

It seems that Apple doesn't support installations via upgrade discs.\nFrom what I understand, this means that I can't simply begin the installation using the Windows 7 CD, since it is an upgrade version. What I didn't understand, though, is if I can upgrade the OS once it is installed. For example, if I install the full version of Windows Vista Ultimate, could I then upgrade it to Windows 7? Or is my only option to purchase a full edition of Windows 7?\n\nA: Actually, it's not that Apple won't let you install Windows from an upgrade disc\u2014it's Microsoft that won't.\nThink of it in terms of a blank hard drive on (what will be) a Windows PC. You can't use an upgrade disc to install Windows, as there's no OS there to upgrade.\nHowever, once Windows is installed, you can then upgrade to a later version of Windows. This is covered in the Boot Camp\nInstallation & Setup Guide (pdf), page 15+.\n\nA: What @dori said is correct. The ability (or lack of) to upgrade a Windows edition to another, is restricted by Microsoft. If what you have is correct, you could install Vista Ultimate and then upgrade to Windows 7, however, this is a bad idea in terms of final results. \nWindows 7 \"upgrades\" haven't been too smooth according to users doing that both in Virtual Machines, Bootcamp and Native PCs.

I'm assuming it's part of the 'check for updates' process, but does anyone know how this is controlled and what it's mounting and unmounting?  \nI first discovered this behavior after updating Growl, and I ran HardwareGrowler to see what it did (it was a slow afternoon) and it's kind of neat to see what hardware is connected at any given time, and watching what happens when I plug in various USB peripherals, etc.  I know, I have a severely deficient view of entertainment.  After amusing myself with this for about 5-10 minutes, I returned to my work.\nSome time after this, I spotted out of the corner of my eye a Growl message that said 'Volume Mounted Google 8.0.0 (something)'  And just as quickly 'Volume Unmounted Google 8.0.0 (something)'.  I didn't get time for screen shots, it appeared and disappeared within seconds. \nHas anyone else noticed this and is the explanation for it posted somewhere online?  Apparently there's some helper process that's running that's doing it, but I don't see anything in Activity Monitor with Google or Chrome in the name.  I'm not a process-killing weenie, I'm just curious about this behavior I'd never noticed before.\n\nA: Apparently there is a Google Software Update process that is queued to run periodically, which is why it's not always there. (I couldn't grab a screenshot of it, it was too sneaky). It's not just for Chrome, but for Google Earth and Picasa too. It was a bit of a breadcrumb hunt finding info about it.\n\nI think the Google updater isn't a proces that runs all the time, but a launchd job that runs when you boot and every so often after that. Google com.google.keystone.user.agent and you'll find a number of explanations of what they've done (and how to get rid of it if you want).\ncharlie  (Apple Discussions)\n\nFrom Google's Help Page:\n\nGoogle Software Update is a background application for the Mac OS that helps ensure that you always have the most up-to-date, stable, and secure versions of the Google software you have installed.

{"text": "Q: Setting a custom log I have to get all the chromium and firefox info logs out of /var/log/system.log and into a nice quiet /var/log/{chromium,firefox}.log. \nHowever I can neither recall or find how to set that in syslog.conf.  How would I go about doing that?\nEDIT:  I have been looking at the asl.conf file  for the asl logging daemon.  This seems to have something to do with what I want, although, going from syslog to a binary log format is directly against sense.\nEDIT:  To be very clear one can use syslog to dynamically slice the logs. Apple is transitioning from syslog to the apple system log. So the grep approach only deals with the deprecated /var/log syslogd files. \nSwitching to syslog-ng and logging to sqlite would seem to be easier, but who knows?  I'm sure the proprietary format is the way to go.\nNote that\nsyslog(1) \n\nis the command line tool for the ASL database.\nsyslog(3) \n\nis the C api to the syslogd daemon.  The ASL replacement for the above is\nasl(3)\n\nNow, \nsyslogd(8) \n\nhas 2 modules, one writing to the files defined in\nsyslog.conf(5)\n\nand one writing to the apple system log, as defined in \nasl.conf(5) \n\nASL seems to be the future. Syslogd is configured by both syslog.conf and asl.conf.  \n\nA: The situation is like that: Applications can use the syslog(3) API and the asl(3) API to log messages, other data logged can come from the kernel or from the network. All of these messages are handed over to the syslog Daemon: syslogd(8). The syslogd now outputs log messages both the BSD way (it writes stuff into various basic log files like /var/log) and into a unified log message store (/var/log/asl.log).\nIf you want certain log messages not to appear in your log files (eg. you read logs like system.log by selecting them in Console.app), you will need to configure syslog.conf(5) like chiggsy said. If you want messages not to be stored in the asl database, you will need to configure asl.conf(5).\nIf, for example, you do not longer want Bonjour's (mDNSResponders) Log messages to be stored in the ASL db, you will need to add the following line to /etc/asl.conf :\n? [= Sender mDNSResponder] ignore\n\n\u2026 and then \"gently\" restart the syslogd by:\nsudo killall -HUP syslogd \n\nNow, messages from mDNSResponder will no longer appear when you go into Console.app's \"all messages\", but still exist within your logfiles.\nLastly, if you call syslog(1) from the command line, it acts as a nice frontend for querying the ASL db - you could for example ask it to show all messages from the Time Machine Backup starter that were logged in the last two hours by running:\nsyslog -k Facility -k Sender com.apple.backupd-auto -k Time ge \u22122h\n\n\u2026which explains, why the ASL db is handy: you can search for log files simultaneously in \"all log files\". \n\nA: There are 2 answers in practice, if I want to change the logging file location.\nSyslog:\nSolution is to not read the OS X syslog.conf manpage. Read the FreeBSD one.

I have consistently upgradedthe operating system every time an upgrade was available, so I am now running iOS 3.1.\nNo problems whatsoever, running all sorts of apps, many of which required iOS 3+.\nDon't confuse the operating system version with the iPod/iPhone generation (gen 1, 2, 3 or 4).\n\nA: You can Using your iPod as a storage drive:\nFrom apple support:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Connect iPod to your computer.\n  \n*Open iTunes if it doesn't automatically open.\n  \n*Select the iPod icon in the Source pane.\n  \n*Click the Summary tab.\n  \n*Select \"Enable disk use\" or \"Manually manage music and videos.\"\n  Either one will allow you to use iPod\n  as a drive. If you select \"Manually\n  manage music and videos,\" iTunes won't\n  automatically update iPod with the\n  iTunes library. If you want iTunes to\n  automatically update your iPod, select\n  \"Enable disk use\" instead.\n  \n*The iPod disk icon appears on the desktop and in Finder windows, and in\n  My Computer/Computer in Windows.\n  Double-click the icon and drag files\n  to or from iPod's window to copy them.\n  \n*Make sure to eject iPod before disconnecting it from your computer.\n  Tip: The iPod display will say \"Do Not\n  Disconnect\" when disk use is enabled\n  (iPod shuffle's status light will\n  continue to blink orange until after\n  it is ejected). These are reminders\n  for you to eject iPod first.\n  \n\n\nA: Yes, you can run apps on that. You've got to upgrade to 3.1.3. I think it costs $10.\nNot all apps will run though, but most of them will run fine.\n\nA: You could always jailbreak your device you can do loads of cool things like running android or loads of new settings its really good\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6569", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

I've got an old MBP where the internal drive starts to refuse reading discs and stopped burning discs a while ago.\nNow I'm thinking about getting an external drive (DVD-RW, USB or Firewire).

{"text": "Q: Rent foreign language films in iTunes It\u2019s now pretty well-established that you cannot change the language of the iTunes store unless you also change your billing address.\nFair enough.\nBut the language setting also dominates the contents of the store completely. I.e. I cannot download films that, though available in the US, have not (yet) appeared on DVD in Germany (having a German billing address).\nThis is annoying.\nBut it gets worse: apparently I also cannot rent/buy the original version of most DVDs that are available.\nWhen I buy a DVD in Germany, it always also contains the original voice track. No reason not to include it, after all. Since most film translations are sloppy and generally just incredibly poorly done, and since even the well done translations necessarily lose some of the finer nuances, I always try to watch the original versions of films of which I understand the language, and I know a lot of people who do the same.\nSo this must be a common request.\nIs there any way to rent/buy the original version of the available iTunes films?\n\nA: Short (and only) answer: No, you cannot rent or buy movies in other languages. I share the same problem in Spain, movies are dubbed in spanish. \nMatrix sounds hilarious in spanish, trust me. \nThere's no way to change that.

Since I code, I want a fairly large monitor with a fairly large resolution so that I can see a lot of code. The only thing better than high resolution is very high resolution. :)\nThe Lenovo laptop is docked and has a digital output (the unused rectangular white outlet in middle of the picture)\n\nSince I want a large monitor which is going to be a decent investment, I should get one with the best goodies so I can hook up other things to it and use it for other purposes. \nSo here is a two part question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can anyone provide insight on the features to get?\n\n*How do I go about choosing a monitor that can be shared between the Lenovo and the Macbook Pro laptops?\n\nA: This may have less to do with the monitor you get and more to do with how you hook up the laptops to the monitor. When using multiple desktops on a single monitor, I've found KVM switches extremely useful. If you were planning on using a single keyboard for the two laptops, I would recommend this approach. However, I'm not aware of a single keyboard that will give you OS-specific controls for both Mac (command, eject, volume, etc) and Windows (start, etc).\n\nA: @Daniel has a good idea with the switch.\nHowever, if you don't need to share keyboards/mice, I recommend getting a monitor with multiple inputs (almost all these days) and just connecting the Lenovo to one and the MacBook Pro to the other. Switch the inputs on the monitor.\nThe downside of this is that, even if the monitor isn't using the Mac's input, the Mac will think it's connected. So, you may get windows popping up on a nonexistent monitor, and losing your cursor now and then.\nAs for features: Make sure you get something with a high contrast ratio, and as VESA mount. Even if you don't anticipate mounting it right away, you may well want to later, especially if you share it between multiple machines.\n\nA: In addition to Daniel and Nathan's answers, do not buy any monitor that has \"speakers\", 99% of the displays that came with speakers turned out to be a complete waste of technology (not the display itself, but the speakers), which will let you wonder, why put speakers there in the first place if the volume/quality is going to be worse than using a Megaphone. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6576", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

Info is here, but I have no experience with it.\n\nA: Before iOS 4 - jailbreak software changes could do this.\nFor iOS 4 and later, the lock function easily sets a portrait mode for all apps that run in both portrait and landscape. \nYou can lock the screen rotation on the iPhone 3GS and 4, running iOS 4, to portrait only by double pressing the Home button (bringing up the task switcher), swiping right to show the media controls and pressing the left most icon (looks like a refresh button), the rotation lock. When locked you will see a padlock in the icon and a new status bar icon of the same design.\nNote: this does not affect applications which only run in landscape mode, such as most games.\nEdit: Video of how to do this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYkUzYXtZT0\n\nA: On iOS 7+:\n\n\n*\n\n*Slide your finger from the bottom of the screen upwards. A menu called Control Center should appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the lock icon.\n\n\nA: With the advent of the iOS 6+ Accessibility feature \"Guided Access\", there is a workaround for this. It limits a few things but it completely works if you really need a solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*To enable the feature you will use, navigate to Settings > General > Accessibility > Guided Access and flip the toggle to ON. Set a passcode.\n\n*Navigate to the app you wish to lock rotation in, and rotate the device to a landscape orientation.\n\n*Triple-click the Home button. Depending on how other Accessibility options are set, you may need to then select Guided Access from a popup that appears.\n\n*Select Options and disable Motion. Press Done, followed by Start.\nThis will now lock the rotation in a lanscape orientation! Unfortunately it also disables all hardware buttons, so you will be unable to switch apps, lock the device, or adjust the volume until you triple-click the Home button again to disable Guided Access.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6577", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "13"}}

I am getting tired of using VMware because it's too slow on my computer and was wondering if there's anything out there I can use to wireframe apps specific to Macs.\n\nA: If money isn't an issue, or one that you can wrestle with, then I don't think there is really any better tool for this than OmniGraffle by the Omni Group. It doesn't come with interface elements by default, but there is a freely-available extensive library of options on their site Graffletopia.\n\nA: Even if the need is not exactly the same, some answers of this recent thread may apply.\n\nA: I have the same problem, Visio and MS Project are the only things i can't find good replacements for, so i have an XP VM running in Parallels.\nMost of the time we use the free version of Balsamiq. We have a license for the installable version, but no one uses it, preferring to use the online version.\nNot as clean as Omnigraffle or Visio, but works well for wireframing. \nAlso, consider the Drawing tools in Google Docs, they are excellent and have all the basic shapes.\n\nA: Not the exact answer, but Crossover Mac claims to run Visio 2K3 (And the whole Office Suite) using an API comparability layer, rather than a full-blown VM.\nIt's basically Wine with a pretty GUI and some Mac-Specific Tweaks.\nOTOH, if you're feeling adventurous, you could try straight-up wine, whough it will likely require some console trickery. \nThe Wine App DB Claims that Visio 2007 works pretty well.\nThe easiest way to get Wine on OS X is probably MacPorts -\nJust sudo port install wine winetricks\n\nA: I recommend OmniGraffle, as previously mentioned, with the Konigi Wireframe Stencils or the Yahoo!

If your iPhone is jailbroken you might be able to find the preference file that sets the delay and reduce it.\nOne work around could be to not deal with the accents at all and have the iPhone insert them for you, as autocorrected words.

If you have a different type of \"Connection Sharing,\" you probably don't need a tutorial to set up remote access to your disk; adapt this one as needed.\n\n*Click Disks (at the top of the dialog box), and then click File Sharing. \n\n*Select (check) the \"Enable file sharing\" checkbox and the \"Share disks over Ethernet WAN port\" checkbox. It is strongly recommended that you also set Secure Shared Disks to \"With base station password\" and Guest Access to \"Not allowed\"; not making these changes may allow unauthorized users to access your Time Capsule/AEBS hard drive. \n\n*Click Airport (at the top of the dialog box), and then click Base Station. \n\n*Enter a Base Station Password and verify it in the Verify Password box. \n\n*Click Advanced (at the top of the dialog box), and then click Port Mapping. \n\n*Click the plus sign (+) to add a new port mapping. \n\n*In the Public UDP Port(s) and Public TCP Port(s) boxes, type in a 4-digit port number (e.g., 5678) that you choose. In the Private IP Address box, type the internal IP address of your Time Capsule or AEBS that you wrote down in step 2 (for example, 192.168.0.1). In the Private UDP Port(s) and Private TCP Port(s) boxes, type 548. Click Continue. \n\n*In the Description box, type a descriptive name like \"Time Capsule File Sharing\" or \"AEBS File Sharing\". Then, click Done. \n\n*When you have made all changes, click Update. \nYour Time Capsule/AEBS will restart. Once it does, you are now ready to connect to the Time Capsule/AEBS hard drive via the Internet. To do this when your MBA is away from home: \n\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder, click Go > Connect to Server. \n\n*Type in the correct domain name or external IP address for your network, plus a colon and the port number you specified in step 11. For example, \"www.myhomedomain.com:5678\" or \"123.123.12.123:5678\". \n\n*Click Connect. \n\n*You will be prompted for your user name and password.

For most consumer (non-business) use cases, you are going to want a software VPN.  It is ideal that this VPN is at the edge of your network so unauthenticated users cannot get beyond the VPN onto your network.\nOK, now things just got messy because now you need to know about VPNs, and thats not simple.  That's probably why this feature (access files remotely over WAN/internet) was not promoted (even if it has minimal insecure support).  So my explanation will stop here.

{"text": "Q: When plugged in, does the iPhone use the battery or the external source during heavy use? I love to play games and do other tasks that quickly drain the iPhone's battery. Sometimes I'll use the phone while plugged into a power supply. Does the iPhone still use the battery when performing these high-performance tasks while connected to the power source?\n\nA: When you're plugged in to a power source, the iPhone will not use the battery unless for some reason you are using more power than the charging source can provide.\nNormally, unless some process is hitting the CPU and GPU and all radios (such as a GPS mapping app), even a computer USB port at 500 mA will both power your games/apps and charge your battery at the same time. \nEven if your game takes more current than the charge is providing, using all the wall power will reduce the amount of battery being consumed which will certainly save your battery.\nOf course, you should expect hundreds of full charge/discharges and as long as you are one a month draining the battery, you don't need to keep the electrons moving otherwise for good battery lifespan and health.\n\nA: Although Nathan has a valid point for wall charging, from personal experience it is possible to discharge the battery while it is plugged into a powered USB port.\nEven though my iPod Touch 2nd Gen was plugged into my MacBook, playing Need for Speed Undercover was sufficient to cause the device to power down due to low battery. It seems that a powered USB doesn't provide sufficient charge to offset the drain caused by a graphically intensive game.\nTo sum up: if you are worried about exhausting the battery while charging, use a wall charger.\n\nA: nonsense , the icon means nothing , i have my phone at 100% with the plugged in icon , i use it for awhile it goes back to lightning icon , i use r more it goes down to 99% , at 96% now having used it plugged in since 100% watching stuff in YouTube multitasking iPod etc\nit shows Apple electronics suck that they are clever enough to implement this - or they prefer batteries have shorter life , to charge you more money\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6624", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "9"}}

{"text": "Q: How well does Apple Remote Desktop work over the Internet? I have a few family members with Macs that I'd like to be able to help if they have questions or get stuck, and I've been looking into various solutions to be able to remotely connect to their computers over the internet. In the past I've mainly used iChat, but it sometimes just doesn't work (and I do have a few members in my family that have a bit of trouble accepting the screen sharing invitation). My typical fallback is Skype which nearly always works, but I don't have any control over the screen so I have to walk them through what they need to do.\nNow that Apple Remote Desktop is available in the Mac App Store for $80, I'm wondering if it does what I need. Namely, I'd like to be able to automatically connect and control a remote computer over the internet without having to configure the router it's connected to. Does Apple Remote Desktop have this capability?\n\nA: Apple Remote Desktop will involve either having a VPN or open ports and static IPs. I think you will be much better off with LogMeIn.com's free version, which will require zero intraction from your family members and open ports are not necessary. You will need to know a user's credentials on their computer. If they require more privacy they can disable LogMeIn from the menu bar item, as it will always be on as long as they are connected to the Internet. I suggest adding a user to each computer with your name and one password\u2014that will be one less thing for you to remember and if they change their password or don't remember it you can still help them. \nI use both ARD and LogMeIn daily, but ARD is more than you need. \n\nA: It appears that it does do this, with little setup required.\nSee the Apple Remote Desktop 3 Remote Assistance tutorial here.\n\nA: ARD/Screen sharing works super great to servers with static/public IPs.  Not so great behind a NATed home router with port blocking on a dynamic IP.  It can be done, but you will have to go there first to set up the port forwarding, etc.  \nIf you have an outside server hosted somewhere, you could set up VPN on your machine and the machine you want to admin too.  (That's easy to tell your parents to click the VPN icon in the menu bar).\nAlso, I think you can use \"back to my mac\" to make all this easier, but I don't know much about the details.\n\nA: ARD works better for remote support than other VNC solutions since it seems better at controlling the bandwidth needed to send a view of the screen over a slow connection.\nOther than that, it's a plain old VNC wrapper if you only care for keyboard, mouse. It is fully featured in terms of shuttering the remote screen (to hide what you are doing) as well as can be set to remotely poll lists of hardware, script and control updates to tens, dozens, and hundreds of machines.\nIt doesn't do any sort of location brokering, though so you'll still need to manage the routers, port forwarding, client configuration and such as well as use dynamic DNS or BackToMyMac or Screens connect.\nFor most people doing light support, I'd recommend the Screens program over ARD due to cost, better integration and testing of NAT and how it provides DNS tracking to let your Mac know what IP your family's Mac is using at this very moment.\n\nA: Although Apple's Screen Sharing/ARD works well over the internet, Google's Chrome Remote desktop is the best cross-platform solution I have found so far.  \nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is faster than stock VNC.\n\n*Works from/to Mac/PC/Linux (Cross-Platform)\n\n*Encrypted (unlike stock VNC)\n\n*Works with any NAT situation, most firewall situations\n\n*Helper mode to work on other people's PCs\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Requires Google Account login (Big brother and all that)\n\n*Not Multi-User, only works when user is logged into the machine already\n\n*PIN Authentication\n\nIn-Between:\n\n\n*\n*Requires Chrome?

{"text": "Q: Is the white MacBook suitable for software development? I'd like to know if you think the white MacBook (2.26ghz, 2gig ram) is sufficient for software development (using Xcode, Interface Builder etc...)\n\nA: To elaborate on @Mart\u00edn's answer, a MacBook is perfectly fine for development, I use one myself and never had issues.\nBut you could improve it. Switching to 4GB of RAM would be first thing on the list. Using a second screen could also vastly improve this setup. Another (bigger) investment would be to buy a SSD.\n\nA: XCode 3.x (and possibly 4.x when it's released) will definitely work on that Macbook. I have an old white Macbook 2.4 Core 2 Duo with 2GB of RAM and it works. Compared to the 8 Core Mac Pro, it's really slow, but it's fast enough to use it and do things with it. \nIf you want to compile a big and complex project, it will of course take longer, but other than that, the hardware is perfectly capable of running Xcode and its surrounding tools.\nThe projects will take longer to load after a cold boot, and the whole machine is naturally more limited in terms of absolutely everything (compared to a regular Mac Pro, iMac or even a newer Macbook/Pro), but if you need a light and loyal machine, this will definitely serve you.\nI'm using mine with Mac OS X 10.6.6. I remember even playing World of Warcraft on that machine a year ago.\n\nA: I'm using an old White Macbook with 4gb of RAM and it runs perfectly.\nSpecifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor: 2.2 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo\n\n*Memory: 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM\n\n*OS: Snow Leopard\n\n\nA: I own a white MacBook (MacBook4,1) with the 13\" screen. I got the RAM upgraded to 4GB right when I bought it, so I unfortunately cannot say whether 2GB would be sufficient for iOS development. However, with 4GB, I run a low-profile Linux VMware Fusion VM for development, and also XCode and IB, and my system runs fine for the most part. Over the years, it has become a bit slower, though.\nI'd like to point out that the 13\" screen may cause problems. While it is an amazing screen in terms of display quality, it is sadly pretty small for most development stuff. I am not saying you cannot get anything done. You can. I did for over two years. But it cuts down on your productivity. In the case of Interface Builder, you will quickly feel the constraint as Interface Builder is fond of spewing countless Windows all over the place. A second display is going to help a lot, but you may probably not be able to get exactly the same quality of display on the external as you would on the laptop screen.

The icons on this bar are different for music tracks than for podcasts (repeat, genius and shuffle).\nIt's possible the ipod has got into 2x speed mode. I had this the other day, and either toggling the speed mode or pausing and playing again solved it, don't remember which.\nEdit: today I had this problem. It seemed that the fast foward button was down, because the pause button was behaving oddly with this weeks \"PC Pro\" podcast, and the x1 x2 button didn't fix it.

{"text": "Q: Checking for folder/file changes using Automator? Is there there a way to check a folder/file for changes (includes adding files, deleting files, changes in files,...). The 'Folder action' in Automator is only checking if any files are newly added. \n\nA: You can add a \"Run Shell Script\" action with the command:\nfind <directory> -newermm <reference_file>\n\nThis will give you all files and directories inside <directory> that have changed since the last change of <reference_file>. Just make sure you modify the <reference_file> each time you run the Automator script.\nAlso give a look to the find manual page (enter man find in the terminal) for more options. Find is very powerful and further refining your search is usually a matter of a couple of additional options. E.g. to search only for directories modified after <reference_file>:\nfind <directory> -type d -newermm <reference_file>\n\nIf the version that ships with OSX is not enough, you can also try the version that comes with findutils (brew, macports etc) which should have slightly more features.\n\nA: I don't know of a way to do this with Automator, but there is an app in the App Store called Folder Watch that may do what you're asking. \n\nA: So last time I checked, Automater is using Applescript in the background to script your actions. Applescript does not have much depth to it. While it can get the list of files in a directory (and so therefore you could find out when something gets deleted), I don't believe it can calculate changes to a file.\nWhat you really need to harness is file system notifications. And since that's a beast, I would take kraymer's advice and use launchd. It has hooks to execute anytime the contents of a folder is changed. Lingon (see also its outdated SourceForge page) is a great application for helping people jump into launchd. You can write your automator script/application to do whatever you were planning to do when your directory was modified and just have the launchd task call that.\n\nA: You can check at an earlier answer of mine, but it sounds like you want \nfs_usage -f filesys  \n\nLaunchd is not the way to go for file changes, fs_usage uses the underlying machine that powers spotlight.\nEDIT: I'm utterly wrong here. Launchd has exactly that functionality required, ie: do something on a file or directory change.\nYou make a .plist file.\nScream \"XML SUX FOR CONF FILES!\"  ( It really does. )\nand you'll want to use one or both of the keys below in your launchd job.\nWatchPaths <array of strings>\n This optional key causes the job to be started if any one of the listed\n paths are modified.\n\n QueueDirectories <array of strings>\n Much like the WatchPaths option, this key will watch the paths for modi-\n fications.

We have a shared iPad at work which is used for trade shows etc.\nIt is a pain to only be able to copy content to this from one PC, i.e. one nominated shared PC with iTunes on it.

If you go to the \"Apps\" tab inside the device's pages in iTunes, you'll see CineXPlayer listed below, in \"File Sharing\". Select CineXPlayer and drag movies to the \"Documents\" pane.\nTa da!\n\nA: *\n\n*Use a free cross-platform program like Handbrake to convert your video into an iPad supported format\n\n*Take an SD card that you've used with a digital camera and put your movie(s) into the DCIM folder\n\n*Use the camera connection kit to  load the movie.  For all the iPad knows, it's a movie you shot with your digital camera\n\n*Note that the movie will load into your \"Photos\" and not your \"Videos\" - that means there are some limitations (no recognition of chapters, no resume functionality) but it will work very well and is a much easier solution than anything that uses a connection to a computer or to the cloud\n\n\nA: \"Instead of syncing have you tried the Manually Manage option? Then you can load content to it from multiple PCs without doing a complete sync. support.apple.com/kb/ht1535 \u2013 Ryan Sharp Jan 25 at 16:55\"\nContrary to this being the top rated answer, this is incorrect. In order to actually choose the Manually Manage option, you must first sync the device with that target computer. I just tried it and it tells me that it will erase all content on the iPad and then I will be able to manually manage.

{"text": "Q: What does \"plays\" really count in iTunes? iTunes displays the number of \"plays\" for each track. What exactly does this mean?\nFor example, playing a little bit of a track does not seem to increment the number. But playing most, but not all, of a track seems to.\nDoes playing n seconds trigger the increment? n percent of the track? Or something else?\nI have a 4GB iPod Mini, if that matters.\nThe motivation is, I have iTunes set to automatically delete podcasts after they're played, and I don't want to accidentally trigger a deletion.\n\nA: I believe that you just have to listen to the last few seconds of a song. You can skip all of the beginning part, and it will increment the Plays if you listen to the end.\n\nA: In the behavior I have seen in the 5+ years of podcast listening. iTunes marks it as played based on a percentage listened. My guess is that would be about 98-99% listened. A 5 minute show would basically be the end. An hour and a half show would be just the last few seconds. \n\nA: In case Nathan G's answer wasn't super-clear: play count == number of times the file played right to the very end.  That means you need to let an audio file play right to completion - either until the next track starts to play, or you are returned back to the song list (if it is the last track in the list).\n\nA: Nathan G. answer was right but I want to add some other info, if you let iTunes play last second of your song and go to another song it ++ your plays of that song, but if you click other song to play and the remaining time of current song is <5s still iTunes ++ play for that song.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6675", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "9"}}

{"text": "Q: How does HTML mouseover work on apple multitouch devices? I asked about this in connection with this network of websites, but it brings up a more general question that I don't know the answer to.\nIs it a problem that mouse over events are not able to be invoked by apple touchscreen - especially in regard to website rollovers?\nIs there a way around this?\nRelated:\nhttp://meta.scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/134/how-to-see-spoilers-on-touchscreen\nhttps://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/75656/cant-see-spoilers-on-touchscreen\n\nA: The way around this is to use a mouseover handler on a \"clickable element\", as Apple explain in their Web Content Guide:\n\nMouse events are delivered in the same\n  order you'd expect in other web\n  browsers [...]. If\n  the user taps a nonclickable element,\n  no events are generated. If the user\n  taps a clickable element, events\n  arrive in this order: mouseover,\n  mousemove, mousedown, mouseup, and\n  click. The mouseout event occurs only\n  if the user taps on another clickable\n  item. Also, if the contents of the\n  page changes on the mousemove event,\n  no subsequent events in the sequence\n  are sent. This behavior allows the\n  user to tap in the new content.\n\nTapping once on a clickable element that has mouseover/mousemove content displays that content.  Tapping a second time does mousedown/mouseup/click.\nA \"clickable element\" is:\n\na link, form element, image map area,\n  or any other element with mousemove,\n  mousedown, mouseup, or onclick\n  handlers.\n\nTherefore to fix the spoiler rollovers they would have to change using CSS to Javascript (i.e. use a mouseover handler on the blockquote, rather than a CSS class).\n(Apple has patent applications for detecting hovering on touch interfaces, so this could go away in the future.  However, it's unlikely that will be soon).\n\nA: There isn't a good way to do this. I've found a bookmarklet that lets you read alt/title text, but not much else.

{"text": "Q: How is it possible that my Macbook Pro with a failed logic board works just fine? Some weeks ago, I went to a client's site to install a new router (Macs rock for IT work!) and when I opened my MacBook Pro (5,1) it didn't return from sleep; the screen stayed black and the indicator light glowed a steady white.  I opened and closed it a couple times, but still nothing.  I presumed some fault and so I hard-powered-off.  When I powered back on, I got the S-O-S chimes described here (I know that article is for the Air).  This continued several more times.  I returned to the office and I did some searching and people recommended Cmd-Opt-P-R to reset PRAM, which I tried to no avail, until...I was pressing random keys on the keyboard and it started right up.  \nI had to swing by the Apple Store for another user, so I asked one of the Geniuses there what his experience was, and he told me that SOS beeping is the logic board, and that pretty much there's no hope.  I was intrigued, and did not tell him that it was sitting on my desk, running fine, at that very moment.\nFast-forward a couple weeks, and my Mac works perfectly fine, except when it needs to reboot.  I find that if I need to reboot, I have to clear the PRAM and then press S or C to start the computer.  Sometimes it takes more than one try.  It will sleep and wake perfectly every time (usually 2x per day, with car rides) and will never give a single issue while running.  Not a hiccup.  \nSomeone suggested a bad solder joint which is being affected by temperature, but I think that's not the issue:  I can leave the computer in the cold car for an hour, sleeping.  It wakes up completely fine.  There's not enough current to be heating any part of the board to maintain contact on a failing joint.  Similarly, I can finish some photo editing and the system is hot and I can close the lid, put it to sleep, and remember 'one more thing' (It's an Apple thing, what can I say?) open the lid, and it resumes flawlessly.  \nEverything I can find on the SOS chimes is 'Hope you got AppleCare, that means your logic board is gone, man' but that is (in this case) demonstrably not true.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  Is there anything else I can or should try?  This has all the symptoms of a firmware glitch to me, or some strange EFI issue.  No one else, apparently is experiencing it at this time.  Anyone?\n\nA: I've heard of a logic board \"limbo state\" where it passes in and out of working. It is broken, but it's letting you use it until it decides to die altogether. You may as well get all the life you can out of it, but don't depend on it to heavily.\nI can't find confirmation of this, but I know I've heard stories of it before.

So I feel like I'm not in touch with the mouse pointer (cursor).\nIt makes me sad that I should not be able to use this excellent hardware on my Windows PC, and I would like to know if this can be fixed.\n\nA: I have experienced this as well (from MS mice in O SX and Apple mice in Win7).

{"text": "Q: How to stop OS X from writing Spotlight and Trash files to memory cards and USB sticks? When plugging a USB stick into a Mac, OS X creates a number of hidden files on the stick, including a Spotlight index and Trash folder.\nExample from the terminal for a USB stick \"Untitled\":\n$ ls -a /Volumes/Untitled\n.Spotlight-V100\n.Trashes\n._.Trashes\n.disk\n.fseventsd\n\nIt even does this on the xD memory card for my camera, so after having copied my pictures and deleted them from the card, the card is still full.\nIs it possible to turn this off for USB and memory cards, so OS X either writes these files to the primary disk or doesn't write them at all?\n\nA: MacOS now provides this direct flag that you can toggle from Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteUSBStores -bool true\n\n\nA: Actually touching the .Trashes file will be the best way to solve your main problem since .Trashes is now a file instead of a folder.  This means that Apple can't relocate the files to the .Trashes folder when you delete them and your drive is no longer full.\nAnother option is to hit Cmd-Opt-Shift-Backspace to force Finder to empty the .Trashes content on the card before you eject it.\nThe first method is really the best as the second affects all Trash contents on all drives.\nHowever, it seems from your post that you are more worried about the pollution of the drive by the various dot files.  If you follow the steps mentioned above, you'll save your disk space, but there will be a minimum of dot files created.\n\nA: @ Miles Leacy's post\nand @ qarma's comment:\nNo, this is still possible even in OSX 10.9, but you need to do a few extra steps now:\n1) In Finder click Go then click Go To Folder...\n2) Type /Volumes and click Go.\n3) A Finder window will open, and it should say Volumes at the top.\nThis is the most important step:\n4) Next to where it says Volumes at the top of the Finder window, there is a tiny blue folder icon. Click and drag this icon left into your Favorites panel.\n5) Now you will have access to your Volumes folder anywhere, including in Spotlight settings like Miles Leacy suggested. (Whenever you need it, just click on the Favorites link to select it.)\nHope this helps,\nBest,\nVlad :)\n~ ~ ~\n\n~ ~ ~\nWhat it looks like after adding the Volumes folder to the Spotlight exceptions list:\nNotice in the background you can see my post in Safari. ;)\n\n\nA: Update for Catalina and later\nOn Catalina and later, you might get an error saying \"Operation not permitted\" when trying to delete metadata stores on removable volumes using Terminal. To fix this, enable Full Disk Access for Terminal in System Preferences > Security & Privacy.\n\nNow, if you haven't done so already, disable Desktop Services Store for USB volumes and turn off Spotlight indexing for the volume:\nsudo defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteUSBStores -bool true\nsudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/<FS NAME>\nsudo rm -rf .{DS_Store,fseventsd,Spotlight-V*,Trashes}\n\nThe first line disables .DS_Store files being created on USB volumes and only needs to be run once. The next two lines turn off indexing for Spotlight and delete the files. These need to be run every time the volume is mounted. Although you could add a script to launchd that will run when the volume is mounted, example https://superuser.com/a/132128\n\nA: I use the MacOS Terminal command line to list and delete all these files and folders before ejecting the device from the desktop.  For some files, you may have to sudo the /bin/rm command.\n\nA: I use Clean Eject (free). It doesn\u2019t stop writing the files but will intercept the drive before it gets removed, so it\u2019s better than a tool that you have to run separate from the eject process..\nIn addition I use a custom Automator Service (also free) to be able to assign a hotkey to clean & eject a volume using the app.\n\nA: Dumbest thing ever that I can't simply contribute this to \nMetaxis' answer.  But it's easy to create a bash script that automatically handles this for all folders in /Volumes (or a specific one if you specify).  Should be able to invoke it with Automator or Applescript when a folder appears under /Volumes, then you have automatic disabling of indexing.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -n \"$1\" ]; then\n    if [ ! -e \"${1}/.metadata_never_index\" ]; then\n        echo \"mdutil -i off $1\"\n        mdutil -i off \"$1\"\n        cd \"$1\"\n        rm -rf .{,_.}{fseventsd,Spotlight-V*,Trashes}\n        mkdir .fseventsd\n        touch .fseventsd/no_log .metadata_never_index .Trashes\n    fi\nelse\n#    echo \"finding Volumes\"\n    find /Volumes -type d -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1 \"$0\"\nfi\n\n\nA: To keep Spotlight from indexing non system volumes, add /Volumes to the Privacy list in System Preferences > Spotlight.\n/Volumes is the point in the file system where all non-system disks are mounted by default.\n\n\nA: Old question, but I, finally, discovered Asepsis. This is an open source utility that solves this age-old problem by confining all the .DS_STORE directories in one place, by default /usr/local/.dscage\nAfter installation, and a reboot, no more .DS_STORE on USB drives, with the advantage (for some of us) of not having to disable indexing on external drives.\nSince version 1.4 it also supports OS X Mavericks.\nUpdate from Aepsis website: \"Warning: Asepsis is no longer under active development and supported under OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and later.\n\nA: The built-in dot_clean terminal command will remove ._ files:\ndot_clean /Volumes/name_of_drive\n\nand merge them into the existing files, thus not loosing any data.\nThat does still leave .Spotlight-V100 and others, though.\n\nA: UPDATED March 2018\nIt seems my solution is not valid anymore, the solution that works right now is proposed by @ElmerCat in one of the answers below.\nHe is suggesting to use CleanMyDrive 2 \nDeprecated Solution\nAs I know you have 2 choices :\n\n\n*\n\n*TinkerTool (free)\n\n\n\n\n\n*BlueHarvest (commercial)\n\n\n\n\nA: An easy way to stop my car audio trying to read hidden Mac OS files is to remove them in Windows OS. Simply copy your MP3 music to the USB stick from iTunes. Swap the stick into Windows OS and select view hidden files from folder options. This will then allow you to delete every single hidden file that your trusty Mac placed on your USB stick including those pesky .trashes files. Finally a use for Windows OS!\n\nA: I ended up using a free app \"Hidden Cleaner\". My car's MP3 player was trying to read .(MP3filename).mp3 (hollow, empty mp3 files) as well. Go to Macintosh HD in Devices section on the Finder left hand menu and drag your USB drive and drop onto the Hidden Cleaner app. It will cleanup the hollow files and leave the real MP3s and will eject your USB.\nNote: That is not a permanent solution. You need to do above everytime you copy files. I don't mind though.\n\nA: Most of the solutions here are 'clean up dotfiles before eject', rather than 'prevent dotfile creation'.  \nIn my search for a free solution for the former, I've tried a few options, and settled on the applescript here: SuperUser: Does anyone have a Mac Terminal script to remove hidden files? because it allows me to see exactly what's happening along the way.\nNote in my comment on that answer that I made a small edit to get it working on OSX 10.12.1. (I'm not reposting the source in this case, as this seems a pretty 'link friendly' question).\n\nA: *\n\n*Insert the USB drive.\n\n\n*Navigate to Macintosh HD > Applications > Utilities and open Terminal.\n\n\n*At the Terminal prompt, type the following command, replacing path_to_volume with the real path:\nsudo mdutil -i off /path_to_volume\n\n\n*Press return.\n\n\n*If prompted for a password, type your admin password, then press return.\nYou will receive the response:\n/path_to_volume/: Indexing disabled for volume. in Mac OS X 10.4 or\n/path_to_volume: Indexing disabled. under Mac OS X 10.5 or later.\nSpotlight will immediately cease to index the specified volume.\n\n\n*If you are using Mac OS X 10.5 or later, skip to step 9.\n\n\n*At the Terminal prompt, type the following command, again substituting the correct path:\nsudo mdutil -E /path_to_volume and press return\n\n\n*If prompted for a password, type your admin password, then press return.\nYou will receive the response:\n/path_to_volume/: Volume index removed.\n\n\n*At the Terminal prompt, type exit then press return.\n\n\n*Quit Terminal.\nThanks to thexlab.com, their troubleshooting Mac OS X e-books, and their website for the detailed explanation of why other methods sort of work.\n\nA: Another way to deal with (just the) spotlight files, is to add that volume to your Spotlight exclude list.  Plug the device in, and go to the Spotlight prefpane in System Preferences.  Select the Privacy tab.  Now drag that volume from your desktop up into the privacy list.. or use the + button at the bottom to add it.  No more spotlight indexing will happen on that volume.\n\nA: Update \u2014 2021 December\nI tested the latest version of Clean My Drive 2 on an M1 Mac, and am happy to report it still works perfectly. The developer continues to update and support the app, which is still free on the Mac App Store.\n(previous remarks below still apply)\n2017 December\nYou'd think after all these years, Apple would build something into the Finder to deal with this. It's still a very common problem for people using USB disks or SD cards to play media in their cars or other devices.\nNonetheless, developers have filled the void with numerous Apple-approved apps. The apps listed in previous answers might have been good at the time, but they haven't been maintained to work with modern versions of macOS.\nI'd also be a bit wary of installing something that will wield total control of the filesystem, written by unidentified developers. Not wanting to deal with the App Store is one thing, but not wanting to register with Apple as a developer is another. Moreover, something from the AppStore has undergone at least minimal auditing by Apple and can be removed from your computer as easily as it is installed.\nSo, whenever you happen to read this \"answer\", its advice to you is to search the App Store for something up-to-date, well reviewed, and free.\nTL;DR:\nMy choice on ***December 20th, 2017*** is \"CleanMyDrive 2\" from the App Store. Solves the problem, lovely interface, completely free. (Offers in-app purchases of customized icons. Otherwise, everything works for free.)\nTomorrow, something better may come along, but the bottom line is: the App Store has free, easy solutions to j-g-faustus' original but enduring question, posed here so many years ago \u2014 a question I had myself today.\nSo I apologize if this seems more like a rant than an answer, but indeed, all of the previous answers were out-of-date and didn't lead to a useful solution. Not saying something would lead more people to waste time fiddling with the Terminal or installing questionable apps. Just go to the App Store \u2014 you won't need to pay.\n\nA: For just a particular mounted volume - like a flash drive called yourUSBstick in this example - these commands will remove existing cruft, stop Spotlight indexing now and in the future, stop the related fsevents logging, and disable the Trash feature.\nmdutil -i off /Volumes/yourUSBstick\ncd /Volumes/yourUSBstick\nrm -rf .{,_.}{fseventsd,Spotlight-V*,Trashes}\nmkdir .fseventsd\ntouch .fseventsd/no_log .metadata_never_index .Trashes\ncd -\n\nOther unfamiliar stuff you may still see you probably want to keep, like Apple double \"._*\" files and other Apple DS cruft relating to icons and window placement.\n\nA: I got this to work on Sierra 10.12.3 in Automator.\nFirst, I made this version of the script:\nIt functions the same way as freefly42's, just a different way of writing the same thing.\nTo translate for non-native bash speakers, what it does is:\nIf run with a commandline argument, it tries to see if the argument is a directory, and if that directory contains a file named \".disable_osx_metadata\".\nIf the special file is not there, then nothing happens. That drive is ignored.\nIf the special file is there, the script deletes all the osx metadata and creates a few small new items which prevents anything else. For instance, creating a file named .Trashes prevents the OS from creating a directory named .Trashes and then writing files in there.\nIf run with no arguments, it runs itself once for each directory in /Volumes.\nSo, if you run it manually or click on it, it checks all attached drives.\nIf you create a workflow in Automator, then Automator runs it whenever a drive is attached, just for that drive.\n#!/bin/bash\nx=.disable_osx_metadata\n[[ \"$1\" ]] || exec find /Volumes -type d -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -exec $0 {} \\;\n[[ -e \"$1/$x\" ]] || exit 0\nmdutil -i off \"$1\"\nrm -rf \"$1\"/.{,_.}{fseventsd,Spotlight-V*,Trashes}\nmkdir \"$1/.fseventsd\"\ntouch \"$1/.fseventsd/no_log\" \"$1/.Trashes\" \"$1/$x\"\n\nSave as \"disable_osx_metadata\", chmod 755, copy to /usr/local/bin .\n$ cd Documents/disable_osx_metadata/\n$ chmod 755 disable_osx_metadata\n$ sudo cp disable_osx_metadata /usr/local/bin\n\nThen open Automator, New, Folder Action\nThen I found that even in Sierra 10.12.3 you CAN still add the /Volumes directory in Automator, by a non-obvious way.\nGo to Finder, File, \"Go To Folder...\", manually write in \"/Volumes\" and hit Enter.\nNow this shows you a window with your HD and usb drives, but no obvious \"/Volumes\" folder to click on.\nBut the title bar says \"/Volumes\", and it appears at the bottom too.\nYou can drag the folder icon next to \"/Volumes\", either from the title bar or from the bottom, over to the Automator, and drop it on \"Folder action receives files and folders added to:[______]\"\n\nClose Finder.\nBack in Automator: on the left, scroll down and drag \"Get Folder Contents\" to the right and drop it.\nThen on the left again, scroll down and drag \"Run Shell Script\" to the right and drop it below \"Get Folder Contents\".\nChange \"Pass input:\" to \"as arguments\".\nShell:[ /bin/bash ]     Pass input:[ as arguments ]\nThen drag the script from /usr/local/bin onto the box under \"Run Shell Script\" so it says\n\"/usr/local/bin/disable_osx_metadata\"\nFile, save, disable_osx_metadata.workflow\n\nFor reference, this gets saved in:\n/Users/YOUR_NAME/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions\nIf you save something wrong, I think you have to manually navigate there in Finder to delete it.\nFinally, for each new usb drive you want to protect, you have to create a file named \".disable_osx_metadata\" in the root folder.\nYou can do it in Terminal:\n    $ touch /Volumes/NO\\ NAME/.disable_osx_metadata\nOr just keep a small text file around with a visible name (no leading dot) and copy it to the root of any new usb drive and rename it .disable_osx_metadata after copying.\nThat drive now gets cleaned each time you attach it from now on.\nNot as clean as I'd like. You have to pollute the drive a little, in order to tell the OS not to pollute it more. There seems to be no way make the OS simply leave it alone and not add any files that you didn't ask for.\nTODO: Add enable/disable functions to create/remove the dot-file.\nTODO: This does not prevent the .DS_Store files in every directory.\nTODO: Is it possible to package up the script and the foo.workflow file so a user can skip most of these manual directions? I see there is an \"export\" option in Automator that creates some sort of package file.\nTODO: Possibly obsolete this whole post. This applescript + automator workflow might be better:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/319553/does-anyone-have-a-mac-terminal-script-to-remove-hidden-files/814104#814104\n\nA: macOS stores deleted files in the .Trashes folder.  You can stop it from doing this by turning the .Trashes folder into a file.  You can do this in the Terminal:\nsudo rm -rf \"/Volumes/CARD NAME/.Trashes\"\nsudo touch \"/Volumes/CARD NAME/.Trashes\"\n\nReplace CARDNAME with the name of your SD card, which you can see in the Finder sidebar.\nFinder is aware of this, and when you tell it to move an item to the trash on that volume, it will warn you that the item will be deleted immediately.\n\n\nA: I found this App in the Apple App Store for free and use it, and it has worked great for me: CleanUSBDrive by Jos\u00e9 A.

I put an SSD in the place of DVD Drive and am using an awesome SSD(80GB)+HDD(500GB) combo for speed and efficiency for the right price.\nAll I want to do is store the sleepimage on the HDD rather than the SSD since I have 8GB RAM and I can't afford to use 8GB SSD to store the current state of my Mac. Looked for a plist to make this change but failed. Not even sure if this can be done. \nI have smartsleep pref pane in case anyone is wondering. It is a handy tool(setting) but I want the state to be stored if possible!\nThank you guys!\n\nA: Nice HDD setup!\nLoad Terminal.App in the utilities folder, and use the following command:\n\nsudo pmset -a hibernatefile /Volumes/OtherVolume/sleepimage\n\nObviously change /OtherVolume/sleepimage to /YourOtherVolumesName/sleepimage \nFrom explanatorygap.net.\n(EDIT: that webpage shows even the author did not succeed with this method. Likely reason is the other drive is not ready to read the image when trying to wake up. Apple says the sleepimage must be on the root drive. I myself am getting a crash when trying this.)\n\nA: Mac's normal sleep do not have a sleep image, only \"Safe Sleep\" or hibernate incurs one.\nAs far as I know, hibernate is useful to prevent slow boot-ups; i.e., a fast restore from hibernate is preferable to a slow boot-up.\nSince you've transition to SSD, this is no longer true. SSD boot-ups are in the low teens of seconds (typically 12-15 secs), so unless restore from hibernate can beat that, I don't see much point of hibernate.\n\nA: I tried locating the sleepimage in the HDD and booting from the SSD in a firewire enclosure. It worked perfectly. I use sleep very often, like 5 times a day at least. I don't want to be writing 40GB of info in my SSD every day since it will shorten its life. We will se if it's reliable with the SSD installed on the DVD bay. If not, I'll just write\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\non the terminal so I get a plain sleep mode both with battery and AC power, trying to avoid running out of power while sleeping (the computer and myself).\n\nA: This worked perfectly for me on 10.10.3 (MBP early 2011):\nsudo pmset -a hibernatefile /Volumes/OtherVolume/sleepimage\n\nI created a path on the 2nd SSD to complete the above command \"/Volumes/HD2/var/vm/sleepimage\".\nI have my lidwake turned off so that I have to hit the spacebar to turn the comp on. This might have \"helped\" with the timing of things, but I didn't have any issues.\nOnly thing I experienced was that I had encrypted HD2, so when the comp ran out of juice and was restarted, it could not access HD2 until I had put the encryption key in which resulted in a full restart instead of from hibernation image.\nMoving the sleepimage to another disk improved my time-to-sleep by minutes ( no joke ). I have the original onboard Apple SSD (older 3 Gigabit link speed) which was taking forever to save the 8 GB sleepimage but now with the image on HD2 @ 6 Gigabit link speed, sleep is back to a few seconds.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6722", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

{"text": "Q: Why does the enter/return key rename a file/folder, instead of opening it? Is there some sort of known logic behind Apple's choice to make the enter key rename a file/folder, rather than open it as is standard on Windows and Linux?\nFor those of you coming here for the substitute key combination, \u2318-O and \u2318-down arrow both work. And I fully understand \u2318-down, since \u2318-up goes \"up\" in the directory tree. But couldn't they have made some other key combination the rename key, and allowed enter to be the \"standard\" open action?\nI understand this is a point of view question, and you could argue Windows and Linux are the weird ones, but \"enter\" or \"return\" is, at least in my mind and experience with others, the universal \"okay\" key. When a dialog pops up, you can smack the enter key for the default action. When you finish typing your password, hit the enter key to submit the form and log in. In terminal, type a command and hit enter. So then why is it browse to the file, select it, and hit enter... to rename?\n\nA: I'm with @ghoppe. Plus, you get the added bonus of avoiding the mindless or accidental opening of an application (to open a file) or executing code when you're really meaning to just browse your filesystem and, well, \"Find\" stuff.\n\nA: \n\"enter\" or \"return\" is, at least in my mind and experience with others, the universal \"okay\" key. When a dialog pops up, you can smack the enter key for the default action.\n\nIn the Finder, the default action is file management. The Finder is not a launcher. You have a bunch of files you want to rename, or move, or whatever. What percentage of files do you actually open regularly from the Finder? Why should the default action in the Finder be \"Open\"?\nYou can learn to use the navigation standard of OS X instead of ENTER/RETURN. The navigation standard is:\n\n\n*\n\n*\u2318 + \u2191 - goes to Parent Folder\n\n*\u2318 + \u2193 - goes to Child Folder.\n\n\nOver time I have found these key operations better than Windows navigation where you have to switch between ENTER and Alt+Up.\n\nA: It's standard on Windows and Linux, not OS X. Doesn't mean it \"should\" be standard on OS X. :-)\nI think it's simply because that's the way it's always been, since as far back as I remember.. I think even OS 6 had this.  I know 7/8/9 definitely had it that way.  So I suppose they wanted old users to feel comfortable making the switch to X.\n\nA: Because \u2318+o opens it.\n\nA: I've used Mac OS X on and off for sometime now, and I still can't get my head wrapped around the \"enter to rename\" functionality. In windows you press F2 to rename a file, because you're performing a function, and that makes sense! Back in OS 7 (what I used for 5+ years before switching to windows) I strongly recall using enter to open things.\nI'm going to try ReturnOpen which only works on 10.3 - 10.5, so far it seems to work just fine.\nhttp://www.returnopen.com/\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6727", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "62"}}
{"text": "Q: Sync iPhone/iPad with iTunes after library rebuild Short Version\nI rebuilt my iTunes library and now when I try to sync my iPad and my wife's iPhone, iTunes wants to erase and resync. \nI want to know if there's a way to save the stuff added to these devices since last sync.\n\nLonger Version\nEarlier today, I added some mp3s to my iTunes library. I could tell that iTunes had moved them to the iTunes music directory, but when I searched for them in iTunes they couldn't be found.\nGuessing that iTunes needed to be reindexed, I rebuilt the iTunes library by following instructions from Apple.\nTonight when I plugged in my iPad to sync app updates, iTunes informs me that this iPad is synced to another iTunes library... which, technically, it was.\nI'm given two choices -- transfer purchases to this computer or erase and resync. \nI'm leaning towards erase and resync. I know that I have some eBooks (not from iBook store) that I added since my last sync which I think I'll need to add again. \nMy wife's iPhone also syncs to this computer and is a bigger problem. Since her last sync, we took a trip to Disney World and she has a bunch of photos that we don't want to lose. (We could email/upload those)\nIs there a better solution that I'm missing?\n\nA: In researching solutions, I found this discussion at apple.com in which somebody suggests \"damaging\" the iTunes library. This lead to a very useful post which discusses how iTunes uses the data it has to recreate what it doesn't have and gives instructions on how to damage (without deleting) the file -- spoiler: erase the data, leave the file.\nFortunately, I had backed up the iTunes files before I recreated the iTunes library.\nI copied my backed up files back into the iTunes directory and launched iTunes and rebuilt what it needed to. There were no apps listed in the Apps display though.\nWhen I connected my iPad, iTunes didn't complain about this being an unknown device. As it started to sync, it prompted my to transfer purchases (i.e. the apps on my iPad which didn't show in iTunes) -- but with no hint of having to erase anything. The sync took longer than normal, but everything is there and I can even find the songs which were originally hidden.\niPad is fine, will sync my wife's iPhone tonight.\n\nA: The one thing you need to watch out for is any app data that isn't backed up. When iTunes erases an iDevice, it doesn't mess around. It deletes everything. If you plug in and sync often, it backs up your data and you can restore from that backup.\nAll purchases on the App Store are available for re-download so you won't lose anything in just erasing the devices and re-syncing.\nYou can pull the images off with iPhoto, which is a really cool app! It's great for rescuing photos, but also for general organization.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can always import iPhone photos with iPhoto or Image Capture (located in /Applications/Utilities) instead of syncing with iTunes.\n\n*Will transferring purchases erase your computer's library? If not, why not transfer your purchases?\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6728", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}
{"text": "Q: If a buy a mac from another retailer, do I get the same warranty that I would get from Apple? On this page, it shows that without the Apple Care package, you get 1 year limited warranty, and 90 days of complimentary telephone technical support on a mac.\nIf I buy the mac from another retailer (e.g. Amazon), would I still get these same benefits?\n\nA: You'll get the same warranty from an authorized Apple retailer as you would from Apple directly. I don't know how prevalent it is today, but for a while you could buy refurbished Macs from non-authorized retailers and you ended up with little or no warranty. (Note that Apple sometimes sells refurbished machines that do have full warranties; the warranty's existence is dependent upon the authorization status of the retailer.)\nApple provides a way to determine which retailers are authorized on the Solution Professionals portion of their website. Be sure to check that list before making a purchase.\n\nA: Every new Mac comes with 1 year of AppleCare.  The option is to extend that AppleCare up to 3 years.  And, I believe you can do this at any time, IF the Mac is STILL covered by your original 1-year.  As in - I believe you can buy 2 extra years right before your 1 year (that it came with) is up.\nWith regards to a warranty done by \"in house\" staff (IE - FutureShop or BestBuy selling you one of \"their\" warranties, which are supposed to be better), it's usually not worth it.  They usually end up sending your stuff off to Apple to fix, so you just wait longer.\n\nA: One of the big problems you often see when purchasing from a non-authorized dealer, is they'll strip the extras that Apple bundles with the machine, and sell those separately.\nThere's a place near me that does that; Go to buy a replacement power-supply and they will have taken out the cord and wall-outlet adapter, and put those in separate bags, forcing people to buy them separately.\nApple's prices are reasonable, as are the prices from Best-Buy or other authorized dealers, and to avoid any BS like those other places I stick with the real-deal. \n\nA: Yes. The warranty is on the product it does not depend the retailer. \nYou can extend the AppleCare warranty from 1 to 3 years within the first year of its life. \n\nA: In the UK if you buy your Mac from John Lewis you get a 2 year warranty, but TBH the Apple warranty is really effective, it's great being able to walk into an Apple store and have them fix it while you wait.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6729", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: How to play Apple ProRes 422 outside of QuickTime? I've received a number of videos encoded in Apple ProRes 422, and it plays fine in QuickTime 7 or X.\nHowever, I can't open them in any other player (VLC, mplayer, etc. etc.). What can I do to let other player be able to read the file?\nThanks.\n\nA: I know that this is an OLD question, but I thought I would add to the answers posted back in 2011.\nWhen it was released you could not open video encoded with ProRes in video players that did not support the Apple QuickTime playback architecture since ProRes was a proprietary Apple encoding format. But in late 2011 an open source decoder became available for ffmpeg as a compile in option.\nJust to be clear, ProRes was never intended as a playback format. ProRes was designed as an intermediate codec for use during video recording and editing, and was a replacement for Apple Intermediate Codec. As a result, it was never intended to be used as a \"playback\" format. That's why you could only play it back with QuickTime or editing software.\nFor optimal high quality video playback across a variety of video players (that have the horsepower to play back your video) you need to encode your video as a H.264 MPEG-4 video. You will want to set both the temporal and spacial compression to minimum, and make sure that the playback bit rate is not capped in the compression software. H.264 and MPEG-4 were designed for playback, and that's why it's the main format behind YouTube, Blu-ray, and virtual all playback systems in use today. While H.265 is starting to become more common, it is not yet as widely playable across a variety of devise.\nIf you do want to try and use ProRes as a playback format, then you need to make sure that the player you are using connects to the QuickTime playback codecs, and that you have the ProRes decoder installed on your system. The only video player that I know that will handle ProRes (other than pro editing systems) is VLC, and you need to have the ProRes decoder installed to make this work.\n\nA: Have you tried QuickTime's Save For Web option?

The logic behind using iCal with delegates is that you don't have the delegates tab activated all the time. Normally a delegate should only be looked at when it's needed.

{"text": "Q: Is a rented movie tied to the download PC? Before I left work today I downloaded a rental movie in iTunes then copied the m4v to a USB key and took it home to watch. However I now can't play the file on my home PC: iTunes asks me to authorise my computer to play films purchased on my account, then when I enter my password it tells me my PC is already authorised but doesn't start the movie. Pressing play brings up the prompt again. Deauthorising and reauthorising the PC acted the same.\nDoes this mean the rental is tied to the machine that downloaded it, my work PC? I did not start the movie there - I simply downloaded it then copied the file. The FAQ, which I had't read beforehand, says:\n\nIf you download a rented movie on your computer: You can transfer it to a device such as your Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, or iPod if it\u2019s a standard-definition film (movies in HD can only be watched on your computer, iPad, iPhone 4, iPod touch (4th generation), or Apple TV). Once you move the movie from your computer to a device, the movie will disappear from your computer's iTunes library. You can move the movie between devices as many times as you wish during the rental period, but the movie can only exist on one device at a time.\n\nIt doesn't discuss moving films between computers. Is that possible? The disappear bit does make me think the ITMS remembers which device the movie is officially on. Is there any way for me to recover this, or will I have to watch the film at work? I rented HD and only have a 2G iPod touch so I can't copy it to that.\nThanks. Both machines are PCs running the latest iTunes, 10.1.1.\n\nA: Without using an iPod that supports HD movies then no. You are correct in thinking that it is tied to the device Apple thinks it is on.\nSource: See Update at the bottom\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6770", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: Using an Apple Display Connector monitor with a MacBook Pro My girlfriend just got her bosses old PowerMac G4 and big ol' Cinema Display. It's got the ADC connector, so I'm not sure if it's relevant what the size is (and frankly I'm too lazy to measure unless it is). I'm looking to drive this off of my MacBook Pro, and her MacBook, both using Mini DisplayPort.\nIt looks like the prescribed solution is to daisy-chain the Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter with a DVI to ADC adapter, but there's two issues with this:\n1) It costs $130. Ouch.\n2) The DVI to ADC adapter looks discontinued on the US store.\nIs anyone familiar with a cheaper solution that doesn't involve ordering an adapter from the UK?\nhttp://store.apple.com/uk/product/M8661B/B\nDVI to ADC adapter, UK store, \u00a370.46\nThanks in advance for any information.\n(Apparently my StackOverflow reputation doesn't cross over so I can only post one link until I get 10 reputation, so I elected to post the harder to find one. Googling for \"apple mini displayport to dvi adapter\" will find you the other one.)\n\nA: Either get one from ebay as (Mike Scott suggested) or Google for a DVI to ADC adaptor. The looking I did suggests that the UK one may actually be the cheapest. \nThe reason they are so expensive is that ADC carries the DVI connection, USB, and the monitor's power. (That's right: no separate power cord.) Any DVI to ADC adapter you get will, at a minimum, have to plug into your mini DisplayPort adapter and into the wall. Here's Apple's compatibility matrix, but their store links no longer work.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I think your best bet is probably to pick up a second-hand DVI to ADC adaptor on eBay -- it probably won't be much cheaper, but it will be quicker.\n\nA: A cheaper, although not as good, solution is ScreenRecycler. It costs $29.99 (with academic discounts available), but it operates over VNC, requiring the screen to be attached to a dedicated host machine, and over the network. I tried it with a PowerMac G4 on 802.11a/b and it was pretty slow, but it should work like a champ over a wire.\nhttp://www.screenrecycler.com/ScreenRecycler.html\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6772", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: Why won't my MacBook Pro automatically sleep? I have my MacBook set to go to sleep after 2 minutes while on battery (via the Energy Saver preference pane.) However, when I leave it idle, it only turns off the screen\u2014it does not actually sleep. This means that if I leave it and forget to close the lid, it always ends up with a dead battery.\nThe system sleeps correctly if it is triggered manually (\uf8ff \u2013 Sleep) or by closing the lid. I have tested it with no USB devices connected and on a fresh user account, on the chance a background program was preventing sleep. There is no relevant information printed to the Console at the time when the system should sleep.\nI've performed a PRAM and SMC reset to no avail, as well as the usual superstitious Verify Disk Permissions.\nIs there anything else I should try before I reinstall OS X?\nThis is a MacBookPro5,5 running OS 10.6.6.\nIt's worth noting that I suffered from this issue some time ago due to a bug in a helper daemon for the product Things, but that this issue was slightly different and involved display sleep. Also, I have verified that the helper daemon was not running during my tests.\nAdditional information:\nI started working through the Apple document titled \"Why your Mac might not sleep or stay in sleep mode.\" I discovered that this issue does not appear when I Safe Boot my computer.

It\u2019s extremely frustrating. I went so far as to completely reinstall OS X, which didn\u2019t solve the issue. This leads me to believe that it\u2019s likely a hardware issue in my case.\nI\u2019ve given up troubleshooting the issue and just use PleaseSleep.\n\nPleaseSleep is a utility software designed for Mac OS X that helps put your computer to sleep when you know some other app is preventing your Mac from going to sleep.\nPleaseSleep sits in the background and waits for the sleep timer you set in Energy Saver preferences pane. Depending on the preferences you set, PleaseSleep will try to put your computer to sleep when the scheduled sleep timer kicks in. PleaseSleep is very easy to configure, you can enable, disable, and access its preferences via the system menu bar icon. You can choose to have PleaseSleep activate the sleep function all the time, or you can tell PleaseSleep to activate the sleep function only when certain apps are running.\n\n\nA: I finally have my system reliably idle-sleeping again. I changed three things to reach this point, all of which I believe were contributors:\n\n\n*\n\n*I was low on disk space (less than 5% free) on my primary volume. The kernel was complaining about this to system.log (viewable in Console.app) about the time it should have been sleeping.\n\n*I disabled Dropbox, which accesses the disk frequently and obnoxiously, and is reported to prevent sleep in Snow Leopard.\n\n*I upgraded from an embarrassingly old Chromium nightly, and I'm now on 11.0.658.0 (73560). There are several bugs open about this Chrome/Chromium preventing idle sleep. However, I discovered this only after getting the system to idle sleep after a reboot with no programs running.\nTechnical observations follow:\nIt's worth noting that the Energy Saver preference pane lies a little bit. I have it set to sleep and turn off the screen after 1 minute, but the system doesn't actually go to sleep for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, give or take a few seconds to write the Safe Sleep image. The screen actually takes 2 minutes to go to sleep. I suspect this is a case of Apple knowing better than us\u20141 minute is probably just too fast. Regardless, this makes debugging issues like this hard because you have to wait longer than indicated to see if the system is really going to sleep.\nThat these two applications were contributors despite not doing anything particularly intensive suggests that Snow Leopard changed something about how the system decides whether idle sleep can occur. There is a documented API for disabling idle sleep, but it also appears that disk activity (specifically writes) more than once a minute also resets the sleep timer and thus delays sleep. Any application that writes frequently is thus a possible cause. sudo fs_usage -e grep -f filesys | grep -e write in a Terminal window can help reveal culprits.\n\nA: Might be Spotlight indexing.  You could test this by going to System Preferences > Spotlight > Search Results and unchecking everything.  Then see if your MacBook goes to sleep.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6787", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "17"}}
