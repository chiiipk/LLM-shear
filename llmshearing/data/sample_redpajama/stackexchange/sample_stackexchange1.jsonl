{"text": "Q: What is the difference between Intel and PPC? What is the hardware and software differences between Intel and PPC Macs?\n\nA: When it comes to Apple hardware, the differences between the last generation of PowerPC and the first generation of Intel were fairly minor, as far as the end user experience goes. They used the same form factors, and the all-new internals were quite effectively hidden by the unchanged exterior and the accommodations the operating system made for compatibility.\nThe last PowerPC Macs were sold in 2006, so any new machine since then is Intel.\nIn general, Intel Macs can run the vast majority of software created for PowerPC Macs. There is a performance hit for the emulation required, but it runs at acceptable speeds even for complex software like Photoshop. PowerPC Macs cannot run Intel software.\nThe latest version of OS X, Snow Leopard, is available only for Intel-based Macs.\nIntel Macs have access to a feature called Boot Camp, which allows them to boot into Windows at full speed. Intel Macs can also run Windows inside virtual machines with the help of third-party software (VMWare Fusion, VirtualBox or Parallels); there is a minor performance penalty for this, but it's much faster than the emulation required for a PowerPC Mac to run Windows software.\n\nA: The Intel chips at the time of the transition were sourced to be far more thermal and power efficient than the PPC chips of the time. Intel had much more room to grow within the same thermal and physical envelopes in terms of clock rate and the amount of hardware needed to support a given processor choice. \nThe PPC roadmap was shooting for massive clock rates in the 4 to 5 GHz range which amplified these disadvantages for future PPC chips when compared to future Intel chips.\nMoving to Intel processors did away with the need for exotic liquid cooling systems, massive heat sink design and complexity due to space constriants that went into the G5 PowerMac. Power supplies were also downsized.\nPPC design was heading directly into mainframe territory with chipkill memory, CPU virtualization, First Failure Data Capture and other high end / high cost features. Just check out this P5 heat sink and 4 processor MPM with associated L3 cache chips to get a feeling for how massive these processors would grow before Power7 manufacturing finally packed more power in a lower clock rate / smaller package. (and this is finally shipping in 2010). Now the Power5 and Power6 are still shipping and awesome at what they do in server land, just not so appropriate for the current Mac market space.\nFurthermore, there was nothing coming in the pipeline for a portable processor from PPC so even though the power was there for future desktop machines if one accepts the many tradeoffs already listed. Quite simply, portable macs were starving for horsepower on the PPC architecture and likely drove the urgency of a transition to anything but PPC.\n\nA: Hardware-wise: PowerPC is a microprocessor developed mainly by the three developing companies Apple, IBM, and Motorola. It is built with reduced instruction-set computer (RISC) which speeds-up the operation of MIPS (million instructions per second). PowerPC is mainly based on IBM\u2019s earlier Power architecture because it has a similar RISC instruction set for microprocessors.\nIntel and AMD CPU's are based on CISC architectures. Typically CISC chips have a large amount of different and complex instructions. The philosophy behind it is that hardware is always faster than software, therefore one should make a powerful instructionset, which provides programmers with assembly instructions to do a lot with short programs.\nIn common CISC chips are relatively slow (compared to RISC chips) per instruction, but use little (less than RISC) instruction\n\nA: PPC Macs refers to the generation of Macintosh computers created in the mid to late 1990s through to 2006 that used PowerPC RISC based chips made by IBM or Motorola. That last PowerPC based Macintosh, the PowerMac G5 stopped being sold in August 2006. The latest version of Mac OS X a PowerPC chip enabled computer was able to run was Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) (so long as the computer supported it).\nIntel Macs refers to the newer Macintosh computers (since January 2006) that use Intel's CISC processors. Intel Macs uses EFI instead of BIOS and can run the latest versions of Mac OS X. Intel Macs are also able to run PowerPC compiled applications through a translation layer called Rosetta which is optionally installed in 10.6.\nIf a program is made available as a Universal binary it is able to run on both PPC and Intel Macs however many new applications released today are Intel only (eg. Google Chrome, Final Cut Studio, Mac OS X Snow Leopard).\n\nA: From the end user point of view, you don't need to worry about it much. Many applications were produced as \"universal\", meaning they run on both PPC and Intel-based Macs, and an emulator (called Rosetta) would let PPC-only apps run on the new Intel machines. \nHowever, as time passed, newer features were only available to Intel Macs, so some applications state outright that they require Intel chips. Also, the latest version of Mac OS X only runs on Intel CPUs.\nApple did a reasonably good job of hiding the entire transition from users, so that everything just kept working as people expected, offloading any heavy lifting to software developers.\n\nA: Architecture:\nPowerPC: (short for Performance Optimization With Enhanced RISC \u2013 Performance Computing, sometimes abbreviated as PPC) and Intel processor.\nmore information can be found at wikipedia: PowerPC\n\nA: I also wanted to know more on the Power architecture, I did find some good info on it.  I'm glad to share the following information, specially for POWER8 (the latest from IBM):\n\n\n*\n\n*SMT8: 8 threads per core\n\n\n*\n\n*can also switch mode e.g. SMT1, SMT2, SMT4, SMT8 \n\n\n*CAPI: Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface\n\n\n*\n\n*first of its kind in industry\n\n*hardware attachment\n\n*eliminates the Device driver overhead when accessing the FPGA.\n\n*Increased coherency \n\n\n*NUCA - Non Uniform Cache Access\n\n\n*\n\n*though each processor is associated with a L3 cache, NUCA let's the L3 Cache be shared by the cores.\n\n*Benefits data-intensive workloads\n\n\n*NVIDIA partnership:\n\n\n*\n\n*through NVIDIA CUDA parallel computing we can obtain an 8x performance increase for Java programs, on Power8. \n\n\n\nMore references:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://community.runabove.com/kb/en/instances/power8-features.html\n\n*https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273393397_The_cache_and_memory_subsystems_of_the_IBM_POWER8_processor\n\nA: One thing I know is that PPCs are big endian by default, but can switch modes if necessary. Intel are little endian.\n\nA: Power PC has its unique set of instruction in which overall is labeled RISC architecture and the way it performs its program goes way faster than that used on PC. About software there isn't difference except the way it was coded or compiled. For example Windows NT 3.51 was developed for PowerPC.\nPC most used processor are labeled CISC architecture which change the way you code and the advantage is operates more than a single task at same time.\nThe term RISC and CISC doesn't make difference since some times RISC 32bits has more complex instructions than CISC 8bits.    \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "16"}}

{"text": "Q: Why doesn't Microsoft Office/2008(& later) support RTL languages? I have Microsoft Office/2008 on my MacBook Pro. Office doesn't support RTL languages like Farsi and Arabic, and I know that Office/2010 (for Windows) also has the same problem.\nDo you think the lack of support is because of business competition, or some other reason?\n\nA: \u201cWhy\u201d is a question for Microsoft, but I'm guessing it boils down to a simple lack of resources on the part of the Mac Business Unit. They have to prioritize certain features, and RTL support is not a priority for them.\nTo address the underlying need, you have several options:\nOpenOffice and NeoOffice support RTL text in Microsoft Office documents.\nMellel has a reputation as the best RTL/multilingual word processor (it certainly has a nice feature set for it, like a direction breaking space so you can mix RTL/LTR in a paragraph), but I don\u2019t know how good its Microsoft Office document interoperability is.\nThis would also be a use case where it might make sense to run Office 2010 inside a Windows virtual machine.\n\nA: Microsoft has dragged their heels on support for RTL languages such as Hebrew and Arabic for years. It's always been 'coming in the next version' for as long as I've been using a Mac. Until it shows up, if it ever does, the premiere word processor for RTL languages on OS X is Mellel. It's actually quite great.\n\nA: Microsoft probably doesn't have the manpower and it uses custom code for layout, plus the market is relatively small as well.\nWhat's strange is that Apple's iWork doesn't work with RTL, although the OS (Cocoa framework) does support it.\nIndeed, OpenOffice (or NeoOffice) are the best alternatives for RTL languages.\nMellel should also work, but it's quite different in its approach to text editing.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}
{"text": "Q: Repair Disk - Start up disk options I had a power failure and upon rebooting noticed that the OS drive needed to be repaired (Disk Utilities). I am running Snow Leopard and don't have the CD to start up from in order to perform the fix.\nAre there any other options for running the repair utils on the startup disk?\n\nA: One option would be to clone your startup drive to an external disk using something like SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner. Then you can use System Preferences->Startup Disk to select that external drive as the boot drive. \nOnce you've rebooted and are running the system off the external drive you can use Disk Utility to run the repair. After you're done, re-select the internal drive as the Startup Disk and reboot.\n\nA: One option that doesn't require any external drives or disks:\nDisk Utility's repair disk is largely* a thin wrapper over the unix fsck (stands for \"File System Check\") utility.  You can run it by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booting into \"Single User Mode\" by rebooting and holding command-S during startup.\n\n*A command-line input will appear; enter /sbin/fsck -fy\n\n*Wait for it to complete.  If you see **** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED ***** then run it again, since sometimes fixing the first errors will uncover more.\n\n*Repeat until it says that the disk appears to be ok.\n\n*Enter Reboot to boot normally.\n\n\n*I can't find any indication that Disk Utility's \"Repair Disk\" function does anything that fsck doesn't.  Nonetheless, Apple recommends that you use Disk Utility instead when that is an option.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

It would be nice if this second click wasn't needed, which leads me to my question:\n\nHow can I make it so that when I move the mouse cursor over an inactive window, it becomes active?\n\n\nA: This is freely possible for the Terminal and X11 :\n\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal FocusFollowsMouse -string YES\ndefaults write com.apple.x11 wm_ffm true\n\nOr, OS-wise, with a utility that seems to fit your needs, called MondoMouse.\n\nA: I originally wanted to do this with my first Mac a couple years ago as well, since that's how my Linux and Windows environments behave.  But I think the driving force preventing this from becoming a reality is in how OS X handles application menus.\nWhat if you want to go to the menu at the top of the screen for an application you're using, but in the process briefly hover over another application?  That would become infuriating quickly.\nIn short, I don't think its doable for that and potentially other reasons.\n\nA: Best little utility I stumbled upon is Zooom/2.

I set it to focus window under cursor instantly when Option key is pressed. Great value, no dock or tray icons, it just works.\n\nA: Amethyst (https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst) is excellent. \nFollow the README.md instructions to download, and then enable \"Focus Follows Mouse\" in the Misc. section of the Settings view.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "24"}}

{"text": "Q: How do I disable or get rid of the startup sound my Mac makes? Everytime I turn on my Macbook Pro it makes a start up noise. This is annoying since there is no volume or ability to turn it off. I just don't want the sound to play at all.\nHow do I disable this startup sound?\n\nA: Open Terminal.app and type:\n\nsudo -s\n\nGive the password when asked for\nthen:\ncat >/private/etc/rc.shutdown.local\n#! /bin/sh /usr/bin/osascript -e 'set volume with output muted'\n\nthen press Ctrl-D and type \"exit\".\nNext time you'll reboot in silence BUT you'll have to manually reset the sound volume (F10, slider ...) if you want to hear some music again. Theoretically it should be possible to run under /private/etc/rc.local a script to do it ('set volume without output muted') but that seems to behave erratically.\n\nA: I haven't noticed that sound on my MacBook Pro for ages, and today I figured out why. The MBP seems to remember 2 sets of volume settings; both for having-no-headphones-plugged-in, and for having-headphones-plugged-in. \nI usually have my external speakers plugged in-when I'm at home, and when I'm travelling/way from home obviously I don't. At some point in the past I have turned the volume down to zero when headphones weren't connected, and now when I start the MBP up there's no sound.\nYou could try this (though it's not particularly practical) - turn the volume on your Mac right down to zero, then restart the computer. I suspect you won't hear the startup-sound. Like I say, not really practical but if the start-up noise annoys you enough, you might just get into the habit of turning the volume down before switching off. :-)\nEDIT: Just realised this this point about turning the volume down has already been made in other answers here, so feel free to ignore this! \n\nA: For Snow Leopard and earlier machines download and install \"StartupSound.prefPane\" which will install a preference pane in system settings to allow you to adjust the startup volume and disable the startup sound:\nhttp://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~arcana/StartupSound/BETA/index.en.html\nNote that the above has mixed results in Lion.  For Lion users the following is recommended:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Login as administrator and open a terminal window\n  \n*Create scriptfile for muting\nsudo nano /path/to/mute-on.sh\n  \n*Enter this as content, when done press control+O to save and control+X to exit:\n#!/bin/bash\nosascript -e 'set volume with output muted'\n  \n*Create scriptfile for unmuting\nsudo nano /path/to/mute-off.sh\n  \n*Enter this as content, when done press control+O to save and control+X to exit:\n#!/bin/bash\nosascript -e 'set volume without output muted'\n  \n*Make both files executable:\nsudo chmod u+x /path/to/mute-on.sh\nsudo chmod u+x /path/to/mute-off.sh\n  \n*Check if any hooks already exist (these will be overwritten, so make sure it is OK for you)\nsudo defaults read com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook\nsudo defaults read com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook\n  \n*Add hooks for muting\nsudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook /path/to/mute-on.sh\nsudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /path/to/mute-off.sh\nNotes:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*/path/to/ is the location of the scripts, I used /Library/Scripts/\n  \n*you can skip the unmuting loginhook (i.e. each logout will silence your machine), but I like it this way because I always have sound\n  available exactly at the volume level I set last time\n  \n*root has to be the owner of the script files - running an editor from command line with sudo is the easiest way to achieve that\n  (otherwise you need to chown)\n  \n*to delete the hooks, use the following:\nsudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook\nsudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook\n\n(source)\n\nA: You can use StartSound.PrefPane which basically just sets the volume to 0 when you shutdown and then turns it back up after login.\n\nA: Hold down the mute button on your keyboard whenever you boot it\n\nA: If you keep your volume off when you shut down your mac/laptop it wont make the sound when you start it up again!\nI don't know if this is true but its what my laptop does :)!\nHope this helps!\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "57"}}
{"text": "Q: Multitasking on iPhone Does the iPhone close the background programs if it runs out of memory or battery?\n\nA: There are two ways to approach this question.\nFrom the end user's perspective, the answer is no. No matter what you do, the app will come back to the same state it was in previously, unless you close it from the switching interface.\nTechnically: yes. When the device runs short on RAM, it will freeze the application's state from RAM to the main storage (flash). When you resume, it loads the state from flash back into RAM, and then resumes. This is intended to happen quickly enough and transparently enough to be indistinguishable, but you may sometimes notice that resuming takes a bit longer if you have loaded several other apps in the meantime (and therefore pushed the app out of RAM). \n\nA: They aren't really \"in memory,\" more like cached to disk if and when necessary. Many apps don't even use the multitasking or aren't setup for it. When you switch it does actually close the app.\nBeing in the task bar doesn't guarantee that it's actually in memory, actively running, or both. The OS manages that. \n\nA: No. Even restarting, complete power down and power up, will not remove the background applications from memory.

It started giving problems a few weeks ago by restarting for itself every 2 mins. I took it at the apple dealer and repair center in South Africa where I currently stay, they tried fixing it but said that it needs to be replaced but they can't replace it since its under international warranty and they only deal with South African bought products. \nSo I guess the warranty is not international\n\nA: Apples warranties are international except for the iPhone where the warranty is only valid in the country the phones was bought in.\n\nA: Apple Warranty is international and you can use your warranty on every country that apple has branch.\nbut other than warranty you can buy AppleCare Protection.\nApple has \u201cglobal repair coverage\u201d If you carry your Apple computer or iPod when you travel and happen to need repair service, AppleCare Protection Plan offers global repair coverage.\nbut for this you need to purchase AppleCare Protection , and if you want go to other country to buy your product cheaper AppleCare Protection not a good Idea. \n\nA: Yes it's international.\nMy friend bought a MacBook in the US and had a warranty case in Switzerland. The warranty case got solved without any problems.\n\nA: AppleCare warranty is international, sort of no questions asked (unless you take in a soaking iPod).\nApple's limited 1 year warranty is sort of international. As in, your local Apple Service Provider may provide you with warranty or may choose to be very strict on the wording and not cover anything they don\u2019t have to cover to the letter of the law and agreement.\n\nA: Yes, Apple's computer warranties are international. Worst case, you have to ship your product back to the purchasing country if Apple asks for that, but the wording and common practice is U.S. purchases generally get covered everywhere Apple has service globally.\nSee Apple's Warranty Page for more details.

{"text": "Q: How can I move an iTunes library from one computer to another? I'm getting a new laptop and I want to move my iTunes library from the old to the new computer. How can I do this? Of course I want to preserve as much information as possible: metadata such as ratings and play counts, cover art, my purchased content from Apple.\nI also own an iPhone which I used to sync with the old computer and now I want to sync with the new one, preserving my apps, contacts, purchased content, etc.\nWhat would be the best way to do this? Is just moving the whole \u201ciTunes\u201d folder from one computer to the other an option?\n\nA: If they both have Firewire you can simply use the Migration Utility.\n\nA: Yes, moving the whole iTunes folder will work fine, as long as the music is in the same location or a subfolder (that's the default). You can even move from Mac to PC and vice versa. However, I would suggest copying first; just in case anything goes wrong. :-)\nIf the iTunes Media folder and the Library files are in different locations, it can get more complicated. It's still possible, but if this is the case and you have the disk space, it's easiest to \u201cConsolidate\u201d the library into the folder that contains the iTunes Library file before you make the move.\n\nA: Yes, simply coping your entirely iTunes folder to an other computer will do the trick. This assumes all of your media is consolidated within the iTunes Media and iTunes Music folders. iTunes will assist in copying music to the folder and organizing a library if you would like to ensure all the media is portable when it comes time to transfer.\nDo not forget to reauthorize the old computer if you are not going to use it regularly in case it crashes and one of your 5 slots is taken up. You can reset things after a lost computer, but it is somewhat time restricted to prevent abuse of that feature.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you are a Windows user and don't want to go through all of this hacking, you can buy iTunes Transfer software at my partner site.

{"text": "Q: Why does my MacBook Pro take so long to go to sleep? My MacBook Pro takes an awful long time to go to sleep when I close the lid. Considering that I generally want to close the lid and then carry it somewhere, I want it to be fully asleep so I don't have any hard drive issues. Is there anything I can do to speed up the process?\n\nA: I recommend a nifty little utility called SmartSleep that allows you to control when the saving of your RAM contents to disk for the Safe Sleep / Hibernate feature Mac OS X has.\nAlternatively you can disable Safe Sleep altogether by running: sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0. To change it back to the defaults, change the value to 3.\n0 - Old style - just goes to sleep.\n1 - Only Hibernate\n3 - Default - goes to sleep but writes RAM contents to disk just in case.\n5 - Only Hibernate mode but if you use secure virtual memory.\n7 - The Default but if you use secure virtual memory.\n\n\nA: Use the command pmset -g log to find out what is delaying the sleep command.  Look for \"applicationresponse.slowresponse\" and \"applicationresponse.timedout\" entries.\n\nA: Depending on what applications you are running it could take a significant amount of time (20-30 sec) to actually \"sleep.\" \nOS X will \"dock\" the hard drive head if it detects sudden movement, so I wouldn't expect any issues there.\n\nA: Another use for the pmset utility (which, like most Apple utilities, is documented: do \"man pmset\" in Terminal) is to tell the system to sleep when you hit the power button. In Terminal, do\nsudo pmset powerbutton 1\nand thereafter when you hit the power button a menu comes up with choices Restart, Sleep, Cancel, and Shut Down. I always sleep my MacBook Pro this way in order to be sure it has really gone dormant.\nOn the other end of the sleep cycle, I don't want the machine waking up while traveling if it gets jostled enough to shake the lid open (even briefly). The Terminal command to estabish this is\nsudo pmset -a lidwake 0\nFor both commands, you will have to authenticate as an administrator.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/53", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "13"}}
{"text": "Q: Is there a way to start a specific application with a keyboard short cut? Sort of like the Windows+R command in the windows world?  That actually just lets you run a command but you get the idea.\n\nA: As of Snow Leopard, this actually is built into the OS.\nLaunch Automator and create a service that receives no input from any application. From the Actions Library, add the 'Launch Application' action to the workflow. Select the 'Terminal' application in the drop-down list of Applications. Save your new service and then assign a keyboard shortcut to it in:\nSystem Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Services\n\nA: Solution suggested by @NReilingh is fine but it fails if Terminal.app is running and it has no opened window (I've tested it in OSX 10.7).\nReplacing Launch Application action with Run AppleScript action and setting the following code to be run does the trick:\non run {input, parameters}\n  tell application \"Terminal\"\n    activate\n    reopen\n  end tell\n  return input\nend run\n\nHere's the full post: Mac OS X: Launch Terminal from keyboard shortcut\n\nA: I wanted a shortcut to always open a new Terminal window regardless of anything else.  Here is the code to do that:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n        do script \"\"\n        activate\n    end tell\n\n\nA: Assuming your running Snow Leopard \u2318+space will open Spotlight which can be used to run terminal.\nSpotlight can be bound to another key combination but the default is similar to Windows+R.\n\nA: In Mavericks there is an option to open a new terminal window at the folder you have highlighted in Finder. To enable this option go to Finder -> Services -> Service Preferences and check New Terminal at Folder.\n\nThen use it from the Finder menu:\n\n\nA: This solution works for MacOS Sierra.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator\n\n*Click 'New Document' and select 'Service'\n\n*Change \"Service receives selected\" to \"no input\"\n\n*Select \"Launch Application\" from the Action pane\n\n*Select the application that you need to launch from the pull down menu.

Click on Shortcut tab.\n\n*Select Services from the left pane and scroll down to General in the right pane. You should see your Service.\n\n*Click the service. You should see a button on the selected service itself which says \"Add Shortcut\". Click on that.\n\n*Enter a key combination and close System Preferences.\n\n\nA: If you have the Alfred Powerpack, you can add a hotkey in Alfred 1:\n\nOr create a workflow in Alfred 2:\n\nHotkeys have a short delay by default in Alfred 2, but changing the trigger behavior reduces it:\n\n\nA: I would recommend installing QuickSilver. It's an application launcher that will remember the applications you launch most frequent and recommend them first. It's easy to launch any application with a few keystrokes.\nQuickSilver is the first Application I install on every new Mac.\n\nA: Not built-in to the OS, but I've been using a free utility called Visor. What you do with it is leave your Terminal running in the background, but Visor hides it and invokes it in a Quake-style console when you hit a (user-configurable) key combo. It's pretty customizable as to how your Terminal shows/hides. Super awesome.\n\nA: DTerm is accessed via a user-configurable hotkey, and pops up a window in which you can execute a terminal command in the current directory.  For example, if you're in Finder and want to tar some files, you just hit the hotkey and run tar, without the need to change directories.  Pressing Shift+Enter instead of just Enter after typing your command will execute it in a new Terminal window, from which you can keep working.\n\nA: I use Spark and have \u2318+\u2325+\u00a7 (I have a UK keyboard layout; \u00a7 is just below esc) to launch the terminal. I prefer it to using Services/AppleScripts because it's faster. Also it doesn't add any visible UI elements like other solutions (I'm very anal about keeping my workspace as streamlined as possible).\nI think development for Spark has stopped but it works perfectly on Snow Leopard.\n\nA: I love Apptivate, it is like Spark. Apptivate lets you \"assign system wide shortcuts to any application, document, or script file.\" It just does this one thing, and does it pretty well. It's very small, so doesn't use much system resource. \nOne great feature of Apptivate is that if it detects the application, say Terminal.app, that has already been running, Apptivate will hide it, instead of launching a new instance of the application.\n\nA: Although I think the Automator / Keyboard binding to Services is better, I think I should mention Quicksilver, which gives you excellent keyboard services for the mac.\nYou should read this article about Quicksilver.\n\nA: This is a bit opinionated and not a direct answer: you can use iTerm and set a global hotkey for it through Preferences (\u2318+,) > Keys > Hotkey.\n\nA: I'm using FastScripts to do this. It's free for up to 10 keyboard shortcuts, $14.95 to enable unlimited keyboard shortcuts (I'm not affiliated with Red Sweater Software, just a happy customer).\n\nA: This is pretty close: CDTo.\n\"Fast mini application that opens a Terminal.app window cd'd to the front most finder window. This app is designed (including it's icon) to placed in the finder window's toolbar.\"\nIdeally, you want a tool that mimics the built-in feature of MacOS 9:\n\n\nA: I use Open Terminal. Check it out here.\n\nA: Thanks for the recommendation for Spark. I have just now tried version 3.0b9 and it worked perfectly in OS X 10.10.3 for creating a shortcut to launch the terminal.

{"text": "Q: Why does my MacBook Pro reach high temperatures when running? I have my MacBook Pro sitting on my desk and it's consistently over 160 degrees. It is almost too hot to touch in some places on the casing.\n\nA: 160 degrees Fahrenheit, if it is CPU temperature, is normal for MBP. \nMBPs are designed to run pretty hot, with the aluminum case as the main heatsink the casing gets uncomfortably hot sometimes.\nIf you want to remedy the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*use a laptop stand (I use Belkin Cushtops, they are really comfortable), \n\n*put your laptop on steady, heat-transducing surface (human skin, blankets or soft chairs are bad \u2014 wooden/plastic/metallic tables are good),\n\n*open up the casing and clean the dust (can make it ~10 degrees Celcius cooler)\n\n*or, use less video- or CPU-intensive application =)\n\n\nA: If you're interested, I've had a lot of luck manually regulating my MBP's temperature a little better with smcfancontrol.  I find that keeping the fans running at 3,000 RPM by default (instead of the normal 1,000) adds no ambient noise over what's already in my office and keeps the temperature a bit lower.  I also use it to pre-emptively turn the fans up to 6,000 RPM when I know I'm about to do something that will make it run hot.\n\nA: That is within range. The chips can run up to 205*F according to the people at my local Apple store (I had the same question).\nThere is a thermal trigger if it gets too hot that will yank power to the computer. Real pain when you're working on something and don't notice the heat output.\n\nA: Short answer: because of the crappy nVidia chip in it. See here for more details and don't forget to use some sort of app to see your actual temperature details. You'll see it's the GPU diode that's burning up. The rest should be hunky dory, at least 12 degrees centigrade below that piece of... extraordinary nVidia technology which I will forever remember for this snafu.\nLong answer: I currently have one of those pre-Unibody 17\" MBPs, with the faulty nVidias. Oh yeah, I'm so happy, I can hardly hold it in.\nIt initially ran at about 75 degrees Centigrade when I used it. After putting it on a smcfancontrol diet and keeping the fans revved up to 4500 as a default, everything was hunky dory except it still ran at about 69 degrees and was burning my forearms (though I love it in the winter).\nLong story short: bought a wireless keyboard, turned the fans down to their standard 2000, 4 weeks later I'm the proud owner of an MBP with a dead nVidia chip on it. Luckily, I had Apple Care so everything was fixed literally without any questions. The new logic board had the gpu diode running at 63 degrees for the first two weeks (with fans turned down). Now their default has become 72 degrees with the fans at 4000. I think I'm going to turn smcfancontrol off, make the default 2000 again and let it burn.\nI wonder how many dead nVidias I have to get in so that Apple replaces my notebook with a version that doesn't have a crappy nVidia card in it.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/61", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}

It is for sale on the app store priced below $5 lately. \nThe promo video is quite entertaining even though it doesn't promote the ease of assigning a custom key command to engage a screen lock.\n\nA: Here is a good tutorial which will help you to create a short cut keys to lock your mac machine\nhttp://www.macyourself.com/2013/01/27/how-to-lock-your-mac-screen-with-a-keyboard-shortcut/\nLock Screen Service\n1. Launch Automator from your Applications folder.\n2. Select Service as the document type.\n3. Select Utilities from the list on the left, then double-click Run Shell Script in the next column.\n\n4. On the top-right side of the screen, adjust the drop-down menus so the statement reads: Service receives [no input] in [any application]\n5. Copy the following command into the large text box that appears:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/\"Menu Extras\"/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\n\n6. Go to File > Save and name your service Lock Screen. Once saved, you can now quit Automator.\nLock Screen Keyboard Shortcut\n1. Launch System Preferences and go to the Keyboard pane.\n2. Next, select the Keyboard Shortcuts tab. From the list on the left, select Application Shortcuts. Click on the plus (+) button below to add your new shortcut.\n3. In the dialog box we\u2019ll want to leave All Applications selected in the first menu. Enter Lock Screen as the Menu Title. Please note this has to be exactly the same name you entered when saving the service in Automator. Finally, enter your keyboard shortcut. Let\u2019s go with Command+Option+Shift+L.\n\n4. Click Add and you\u2019re all done!\nNow when you press your keyboard shortcut (Command+Option+Shift+L), the Mac login screen will immediately be displayed. You\u2019re still technically logged in and processes such as large downloads will continue in the background. But you can leave your Mac unattended without worry \u2013 no one will be able to access your account until you enter your password. When you do, everything on your desktop will be there just as you left it!\n\nA: \nGo to settings -> Mission control and then over to HotCorners on the bottom left corner.\n\nThere are 4 corner setting appearing there. Choose anyone of them according to your feasibility as put to sleep. Just by dragging the mouse to that corner will put it to sleep and lock your system. I guess thats the best easy shortcut i have discovered.\n\nA: If you're using Alfred, just invoke Alfred and start typing \"lock\". I don't remember if it's activated by default, but if not, you can activate and change the keywords in the Alfred preferences.\n\n\nA: Via the Expose system preferences panel you can set a \"hot corner\" of your monitor that activates your screen saver. Say you set the Bottom Left corner, as soon as you move your mouse there the screen saver will invoke. If you've set a password on it, bingo, done.\nYet another option is to enable Fast User Switching in the Login Options pane of the Accounts preferences panel. This puts a Users menu in the top right hand corner, from which you can quickly choose \"Login Window...\". This kicks you to the login screen, requiring a password to move away from, and also does not end your session/quit any running apps.\n\nA: Deskshade does exactly what you are asking. It locks the screen displaying only a huge padlock sign so intruders know the screen is locked which prevents unnecessary attempts to use the machine whiles you are away. \nhttp://macrabbit.com/\n\nA: SizzlingKeys is a little Preference Pane that mostly lets you configure iTunes keyboard shortcuts, but one of the \"Extras\" included lets you specify a shortcut to actually lock the computer and take you to the Fast User Switching screen, not just start the screensaver. I keep Lock configured as \u2303+\u2318+L but you can specify whatever you want.\nSizzlingKeys has a paid upgrade, but the Lock shortcut is configurable using the free version.\n\nA: Another program that can allow you to quickly lock your screen is Padlock. Note that the aforelinked  Macworld review of Padlock also gives a comprehensive review of other solutions (many of which were discussed above) for locking your Mac.\n\nA: FTW!

The nice thing\n  about this combination is that it rarely cause conflicts with other\n  keyboard shortcuts, and once you are used to this combination it\u2019s\n  really not this bad. So in this case I combined it with the letter\n  \u201cL\u201d, for \u201cLock\u201d.\n\n\nA: There is finally a native way to lock your screen, starting with macOS High Sierra (10.13).\nThis can be done by clicking the Apple menu at the top left of the screen, and then pressing \"Lock Screen.\" The shortcut associated with this action is ^\u2318Q. Arguably, this is not as convenient as the \u2756L (Windows + L) shortcut that exists on Windows.\nHowever, one can achieve a similar behavior on the Mac natively. Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts, click on All Applications, press the + (plus) button at the bottom, type in \"Lock Screen\" (without quotes) for the menu title, and for the shortcut assign your own shortcut (such as \u2318L). Now you can use \u2318L \u00e0 la Windows (or your own shortcut) to lock the screen.\nNote that using \u2318L as your lock screen shortcut will render it ineffective for other tasks such as focusing on the URL bar in Safari.\n\nA: Logging out to the fast user switching screen\n\n\n*\n\n*Run /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend.\n\n*Enable the fast user switching menu from the Users & Groups preference pane and then select Login Window\u2026 from the menu.\n\n*Use the lock action in Alfred.\n\n\nLocking the screen\n\n\n*\n\n*Check \"Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins\" in the Security & Privacy preference pane. You can then lock the computer manually by pressing control-shift-eject to turn off displays or option-command-eject to go to sleep. A power key can be substituted for eject in 10.8 and later. In 10.9 and later, you can also put displays to sleep by running pmset displaysleepnow.\n\n*Enable the Keychain menu extra from the preferences of Keychain Access and then select Lock Screen... from the menu.\n\n\nA: You guys should check out QuickLock to lock your Mac with.

I do it with a four finger swipe left. To confiugre this, you need a (free) tool like the BetterTouchTool.\n\nA: Use a keyboard shortcut and use Automator to make a screen lock service. This will allow you to set any keyboard command you would like to lock or start a screen saver on your mac. As referenced below is a nice article on how to do the process.\nHandy screen locking tips for Mac\n\nIf mousing to part of the screen isn\u2019t your thing, you can use the keyboard to lock the screen, but it takes Automator (or a third-party application, but Automator is the better bet if you\u2019re using OS X 10.6). Launch Automator and create a new service.\nTell the new service that it receives \u201cno input\u201d (rather than the default of \u201ctext\u201d). The default is also for \u201cany application\u201d, make sure to keep this set. Next, drag the Start Screen Saver action from the Utilities action group to the workflow. Finally, save the service and give it a name, such as Start Screensaver. Go back to Keyboard Shortcuts in the Keyboard section of System Preferences and look in the Services group. Scroll down to the General section and you will see the newly created Start Screensaver service is enabled. Click in the whitespace to the far right of this entry and a new entry box will appear. Type the keyboard shortcut, such as CTRL-OPT-L.\nExit System Preferences.\n\nYou will now be able to hit CTRL-OPT-L and activate the screen saver in order to lock the screen. If you wish to return to the login window instead (you are still logged in, but the computer is locked) rather than activate the screensaver, change the Automator service to Run Shell Script instead of Start Screen Saver and have it run the following command:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/user.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\n\n\n\nA: From my answer in Super User.\nUsing Keychain Access's Lock Screen menubar.\nActivate it here, in Keychain Access.app's Preferences:\n\nThen lock.\n\n\nA: I've used Salute for years - works beautifully.\nA nod to Windows' three finger salute - \u2318+\u2303+\u232b gives you quick access to screensaver (set a password on the and your done) - terminal or activity monitor.

After having used it on Windows for eight years, I took it with me when I \"switched\" four years ago.\nBrowsers are always subjective, but I like Opera because I rely on its single-key shortcuts, used its mouse gestures a lot before I moved over to a glass trackpad, I have dozens of tabs open at any time, it has session handling, bookmark syncing, and dozens of other neat, small things. And everything is built in and just works.\nI could probably get Firefox to do everything Opera does for me, but it would be a hassle, and it would be even slower than it already is without any extensions. I could never get Safari to do everything I need.\n\nA: NTFS-3G (Tuxera)\nWe still need to learn how to play nice with windows systems (and filesystems).

It's intelligent in how it presents this information hierarchically.\n\nA: VMware Fusion\nYet another virtual machine product. I have tried Parallels and am using VirtualBox on and off, but VMware's Fusion is what I find to be most efficient and feature-full. Unity view is quite efficient when you want to run something side-by-side, while full screen or windowed modes are good for when you need a focus or are just testing out something.\n\nA: iTerm2\niTerm2 is a full featured terminal emulation program written for OS X using Cocoa. We are aiming at providing users with best command line experience under OS X. The letter i represents a native apple look and feel of the program interface, and an emphasis on complete international support.\nNote: iTerm2 is based on the old iTerm and is supported by the original author.\n\nA: Reeder for Mac\n\nA gorgeous RSS reader based on the iOS app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Syncs with Google Reader\n\n*Can manage Google Reader subscriptions\n\n*Has full Readability integration\n\n*Supports multi-touch gestures \n\n*Switches between reader and webpage view in a swipe\n\n*Has customizable interface and shortcuts \n\n*Supports Lion fullscreen mode\n\n*Offers quick access to services (including Twitter, Readability, Instapaper, ReadItLater and Evernote)\n\n\n\n\nA: VirtualHostX\nFor web developers who develop websites locally on their Mac.

VirtualHostX does this by managing your Mac's hosts file and your Apache httpd.conf and httpd-vhosts.conf config files.

And one day, it hit us: our web workflow was wonky. We\u2019d have our text editor open, with Transmit open to save files to the server. We\u2019d be previewing in Safari, adjusting SQL in a Terminal, using a CSS editor and reading references on the web. \u201cThis could be easier,\u201d we declared. \u201cAnd much cooler.\u201d\n\n\n\nA: InsomniaX\nDisables sleep mode, so you can shut your lid without the system hibernating.\n\nA: Google's Quick Search Box\nAn application launcher, like Quicksilver.

Bark intelligently brings\nnotifications from Growl into Notification Center under OS X Mountain Lion.\n\nMuch like Hiss, Bark forwards your Growl notifications to Notification Center in Mountain Lion. The catch though is it forwards them not as \"Growl Notifications\", but as notifications from the actual app that sent them, making the experience totally seamless.\nScreenshots might make it more clear. I reckon Bowtie and Coda 2 don't support Notification Center natively, but with Bark this is what you get:\n\n\nAnd on notification center they look like this:\n\nCorrect icons, correct grouping, the plugin is completely free and works with the newer versions of Growl (App Store versions)... definitely worth checking out!\nPS: Coda 2.0.3 I think now supports Notification Center natively, but you get the idea...\n\nA: Secrets\nSecrets is a PrefPane that lets users access hidden settings in many Mac OS X applications.

Hover the mouse over the iTunes dock item to view information about the current song, You can pause or skip songs and even adjust volume just by scrolling on the itunes icon.\n\nAnd many more...\n\nA: Cinch\nI literally couldn't stand to use the Mac without this software. When I want to full screen an app I just drag the app's title bar to the menu bar and it \"cinches\" itself to full screen. A must have for Mac.\nEdit: Cinch also allows making a window fill the left/right/upper/lower half of your screen (similar to Windows Snap).

Also has a wealth of third-party plugins. \n\nA: Versions\nGUI Subversion client. From their website:\n\nVersions provides a pleasant way to\nwork with Subversion on your Mac.\nWhether you're a hardcore Subversion\nuser or new to version control\nsystems, Versions will help streamline\nyour workflow.\n\nI will say up front that it doesn't inherently support all of Subversion's features, but it does make managing source code and important document for solo developers and small groups much, much easier than dealing with the command line. It's one of the three apps that gets opened with my \"AM\" script.\n\nA: Calibre\n\ncalibre is a free and open source\ne-book library management application\ndeveloped by users of e-books for\nusers of e-books.

You have even an option to use yubikeys with it. I use it for long time and it's just amazing. It does everything I would expect and little more. It monitors when you change password, have a KB of websites and really gets almost all of them, while allow you to configure whenever field with login and password you want. And it's multiplatform.\nBack in 2010 it bought Xmarks and must integrate with that as well.\nIt's completely free to use but it does offer a premium subscription for extra (and unnecessary) features. I personally paid for it as a donation, since I really never use the features.\n\nA: Terminal\nTerminal.app opens a UNIX terminal and allows you to access many power-user tools and features, just as you would on a machine running Linux or BSD.\n\nA: iChat\nI know a lot of people use Adium, and I did too for a long time. But iChat just does what I want and does it slightly more elegantly, so I switched.\nI personally can't live without:\n\n\n*\n\n*audio and Video calls;\n\n*it can stay in the menu bar without launching the application, and log in at startup (if you are familiar with UNIX, it's like a daemon mode);\n\n*support for Jabber.\n\n\nI also use it for MSN via a Jabber transport, which basically lets me connect to MSN through a jabber server, integrating the two seamlessly. Since there are a lot of transport-enabled servers \u2013 for ICQ and AIM (which, by the way, are also supported natively in iChat), IRC, Gadu-Gadu, QQ and of course MSN \u2013 you can benefit from iChat's simple interface with whatever IM service you use.\n\nA: Divvy\nApplication for moving and resizing windows using a \"grid\" approach.\n\nA: AppCleaner\nIt's small and powerful tool for remove/ uninstalling your applications on OS X. \nI use it frequently, it even helps you to remove Cache created the the application from your Mac.\n\nA: Colloquy\nExcellent IRC client that is open source.\n\nA: Activity Monitor\nA task manager, a utility for performing different tasks to a computer processes, in the Mac OS X operating system.

The guide lines\nenable you to measure and position\nobjects with precision. Rulers is\nincredibly useful in many fields, such\nas computer graphics, desktop\npublishing and web design. Rulers can\nalso be used to select a screen area\nand take a screenshot that is\nautomatically saved to your desktop or\ncopied to system clipboard.\n\n\nA: Rip\nRip is an application for accurate CD audio extraction.\nIt uses a smart combination of the AccurateRip database and CD Paranoia to ensure that the CD will be ripped accurately through the fastest means available.\n\nA: Spirited Away\nSpirited Away checks each running application's activity, and if an application isn't active for a certain fixed time, Spirited Away hides the application automatically. It is, in effect, Spirited Away :-)\nThis is a great productivity app, keep your workspace clean and focussed, by hiding all the apps you are not using. No more distractions in the background!\n\nA: Breakaway\nPull out your headphones, and iTunes pauses. Plug it back in, and it starts again. A simple application that makes your life that much easier.\n\nA: FinderPop\nThis tool provides a ton of enhancements to the contextual menu.  It allows you to select move,copy,alias a selected item (icon) to pretty much any folder via pop-up hierarchical folder lists. Built-in preview stuff, and more.\n\nA: Textual: IRC for Mac OS X\n\nTextual is a lightweight IRC client\n  created specifically for Mac OS X. It\n  was designed with simplicity in mind.\n  Textual has taken the best of IRC and\n  built it into a single client. Its\n  easy-to-use functionality combined\n  with scripting support makes it an\n  ideal IRC client for novice to\n  advanced users.\n\nI tried Colloquy; I tried MacIrssi; I tried X-Chat Aqua; but for a GUI client, I have happily stuck to using Textual. \n\nA: Vox\n\nVox is a little and simple music player for Mac OS X with support for many file types, including FLAC, MP3, AAC, Musepack, Monkey's Audio, OGG Vorbis, Apple Lossless, AIFF, WAV, IT, MOD, XM, Games Music and many others. Includes numerous effects like Equalizer, Reverb, Time Stretch, Pitch Shift, Echo. Moreover, all supported files can be exported to AAC+, Apple Lossless, WAV and other formats with enabled effects.\n\nThis is one truly awesome little app which is sadly not well-known. I'd even say Vox was one of the reasons I switched to Mac. Nothing but the essentials for a music player. Besides, it offers some nice audio features (e. g. resampling with antialiasing) as well as built-in Last.fm integration and nifty controls in menubar.\nI prefer to organize my music in folders by artists and albums and not bother with music libraries used in most modern audio players, so Vox's ability to play all files in a folder is the single most important feature to me.\nIf you feel that iTunes has grown far too big for a music player or just don't like messing with audio libraries you should really give Vox a try.\n\nA: Pianopub\n\nPianopub is a free Pandora internet radio player for OS X.\n  It is a port of Pianobar, so please support the original developers. \n  It is for use with your account from the Pandora.com internet radio service.\n\nBy far the best Pandora client ever \u2014 in form of a native Mac OS X app.\n\nA: The Hit List\nTHL is a to-do list/GTD organizer that supports tagging, contexts, tabs, unlimited nesting, alarms, cloud syncing, keyboard shortcuts, and a ton of other features.

Using evidence sources you\n  can create a set of rules that tell ControlPlane what context to apply\n  to your environment.  When ControlPlane enters or leaves a context a\n  set of Actions are performed.\n\nIn other words: it will turn off screen saver protection when You arrive home and turn it back when You leave. And so much more.\n\nA: CheatSheet\nJust hold the \u2318 a bit longer to get a list of all active short cuts of the current application. It's as simple as that.\n\nA: ScreenFlow\n\nWith ScreenFlow you can record the contents of your entire monitor\n  while also capturing your video camera, microphone and your computer\n  audio.

The finished result is a QuickTime\n  or Windows Media movie, ready for publishing to your Web site or blog\n  or directly to YouTube or Vimeo.\n\n\nA: WebStorm & Co.\nThese are the best IDEs for Web development I found so far. The features go way beyond what simple editors offer. Intellisense, refactorings, debugging, source control integration are my favorite.\n\nA: XtraFinder\nXtraFinder add Tabs and features to Mac Finder.\n\u2022 Tabs.\n\u2022 Dual Panel & Dual Window.\n\u2022 Cut & Paste.\n\u2022 Colorful icons in Sidebar.\n\nA: TextExpander\nSimply the best. Save keystroke even if you just use it to write your email address. \n\nA: SizeUp\nAllows you to set keyboard shortcuts for moving windows to certain halves and quarters of the desktop, as well as between desktops when using multiple monitors.\n\nA: Preview\nA lot of people (especially newcomers) completely overlook what the humble built-in Preview app can do. Apart from handling PDFs (including printing them in various layouts etc), you can join PDF files together with it (open the sidebar and start dragging pdf files into it, rearrange pages etc). \nYou can crop & resize images, adjust colour & saturation (etc), save as different image format and even add text & simple diagrammatical annotations to pictures.\nLike a lot of the built-in software, there's an awful lot of flexibility that you simply don't appreciate at first because it's hidden in the GUI - as opposed to huge nested menus of functions, you have to try things with the mouse - often things just work!\n\nA: Jumpcut\nMinimalist Clipboard Buffering for OS X\nJumpcut is an application that provides \"clipboard buffering\" \u2014 that is, access to text that you've cut or copied, even if you've subsequently cut or copied something else. The goal of Jumpcut's interface is to provide quick, natural, intuitive access to your clipboard's history.\n\nA: NetNewsWire\nEasy-to-use RSS reader that syncs with Google Reader (but it doesn't have to).

In perfect sync with the web app itself.\n\nA: Air Video Server (Free)\n\nAssociate to an iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad, through their 2.99 App this is the best solution to see all your downloaded movies in your devices. \nThere is a Windows version as well. \n\nAdded\nSince iOS 4.3, iTunes Home Sharing is now available for all iDevices, and there is no need of having Air Video, though, you wil need to import all your movies into iTunes in order to be accessible cross network.\nFor me, I will still stick with Air Video for a long time :o)\n\nA: Thunderbird\nOn the whole, still the best email app I know for any platform.\n\nA: gfxCardStatus\ngfxCardStatus is an open-source menu bar application that keeps track of which graphics card your dual-GPU MacBook Pro is using at any given time, and allows you to switch between them on demand. (free, donationware)\n\nIf you have a dual-GPU MBP, you absolutely NEED this program! Did you know that some common applications such as Skype enable your high-powered Nvidia graphics card the entire time they're running? I use it to force my MBP to switch to the power-saving Intel graphics chip when I'm on battery. It adds an extra hour or so of battery life which would otherwise be wasted just because I keep Skype online for chatting.\n\nA: Little Snitch - Firewall\n\n*\n\n*rule based traffic filtering\n\n*connection alert for undefined rules\n\n*network monitor\nalso see: Hands Off!\n\n\nA: Aquamacs\n\n*\n\n*emacs on the Mac.\n\n\nA: Filezilla\nNo matter what OS, Filezilla had been everywhere I go, and when you start to use it, you can never really get rid off it.\nThe interface is simple and intuitive, with bookmarks, tree sync, multiple connections on tabs, etc.\n\nA: MacFuse\nMacFUSE allows you to extend Mac OS X's native file handling capabilities via 3rd-party file systems. It is used as a software building block by dozens of products. \n\nA: DTerm\nA terminal window for every application. Press a hotkey (I have mine set to Cmd-Opt-Space), and a floating command line pops up over your current window, initialized to the current directory of that window.\nAnother hotkey allows you to easily paste the name of your current document or Finder selection.\n\nA: MenuMeters\nI have a hard time using a Mac without it these days.  How does anyone -- especially a programmer -- work without having the pulse of their Mac at their fingertips?  How else do you tell when your browser is stuck or is really downloading something, if you can't see the network traffic?  When the computer pauses, and you want to know if it's working, just look at the menu to see that the CPU gauges are pegged at 100% -- and much of that is in the kernel.  At a glance, I can instantly see that memory consumption has rocketed up, and with a click I can see that I'm heavily into swap space.  It's just so useful.\n\nA: Growl\nGrowl is a well-known 'notification' system for the Mac; many different programs support Growl and will pass notifications to it. You have a surprising degree of control over how the notifications appear, how they group themselves together, how they are dismissed from the screen etc. This can be configured universally or on an app-by-app basis, so it's very flexible.\nOne of the most useful features for me has been the way you can configure it to send notifications to selected other Macs on the network - I can leave one of my Macs doing something (such as downloading a large file) while I'm using my other Mac, and when the first Mac has finished doing its stuff the notification will pop-up on the Mac I'm in front of.\nGrowl is free, though you can donate to the cause!\nPrograms that can use Growl include Coda, Dropbox, Firefox, Handbrake, NetNewsWire, SuperDuper!, Transmit, and also Mail & Safari (via helper plugins).\n\nA: MAMP\n(MAMP = Mac Apache MySQL PHP)\nApache Webserver, MySQL Database and PHP in one Package.

It's an underpowered, feature-crippled version of Logic, one of the best-regarded multitracking applications in the recording world.\nNonetheless, Gagareband is very powerful, and does what I need it to do. While I'd appreciate more flexibility (tempo matching would be nice, and the ability to change time signatures within a project), and the program doesn't handle multiple layers of effects as well as I'd like, it performs brilliantly at what it does do, and it's insanely easy to learn.\nGarageband is one of the main reasons I haven't ditched my G5 Mac for a Windows or Linux machine I took so long to replace my G5 mac. (Now I use GB and Logic on a Macbook Pro.)\n\nA: SuperDuper!\nI'm amazed it hasn't been mentioned as an answer already.  It's saved my data on more than one occasion from catastrophic hard drive failure.\nFrom its website: SuperDuper is the wildly acclaimed program that makes recovery painless, because it makes creating a fully bootable backup painless. Its incredibly clear, friendly interface is understandable, easy to use, and SuperDuper's built-in scheduler makes it trivial to back up automatically. It's the perfect complement to Time Machine under Leopard and Snow Leopard, allowing you to store a bootable backup alongside your Time Machine volume\u2014and it runs beautifully on both Intel and Power PC Macs!\n\nA: Google Chrome\nGoogle Chrome is a lightweight, minimalistic web browser based off the open source project, Chromium.\n\nA: Homebrew\n\"The missing package manager for OS X\". Like MacPorts and Fink, but simpler to use and easy to contribute to.\n\nA: Xcode\nA good IDE for cocoa developers. Xcode 5 is now available on the Mac App Store.\n\nA: VLC media player\nAt its simplest, it's a video player that'll play nearly anything.  File extensions supported include: mov, mkv, flv, wmv.\nIt's actually considerably more powerful than that in terms of streaming and converting, but even as a straight up video player, it's impressive.\n\nA: Picasa\nPicasa is free photo editing software from Google that makes your pictures look great.\n\nA: MPlayer OSX Extended\nIt is a media player. I like it more than VLC player.\n\nA: Audacity\nA free software, cross-platform digital audio editor and recording application (from Wikipedia).\nIf you want to record plain old audio onto your computer, Audacity is a pretty easy way to do it.\n(Apple's optical drives from the past several years have implemented region lockout DRM in firmware, rather than simply software, so I can't play back DVDs from multiple regions on my Mac.  It's a laptop, so \"just buy a second DVD drive\" isn't really feasible, and I'm not brave enough to try flashing it with a third-party firmware.  Plugging in my DVD player to my Mac is quick and easy, though!)\n\nA: 1Password\n1Password can create strong, unique passwords for you, remember them, and restore them, all directly in your web browser.\n\nA: Xee\nXee is a lightweight, fast and convenient image viewer and browser. It is designed to be a serious tool for image viewing and management, with a sleek and powerful interface. Xee is useful as a more powerful replacement for Preview, or most any other image viewer available on Mac OS X.\n\nA: Onyx\nOnyX is a (free) multifunction utility for Mac OS X which allows you to verify the Startup Disk and the structure of its System files, to run misc tasks of system maintenance, to configure some hidden parameters of the Finder, Dock, QuickTime, Safari, Mail, iTunes, Login window, Spotlight and many Apple\u2019s applications, to delete caches, to remove a certain number of files and folders that may become cumbersome and more.\nI've seen this utility majorly improve the performance of Mac OS X.  I run it about once a month to automate maintenance scripts and it's helped identify problems like the need to repair a disk several times.  A very useful and effective tool.\n\nA: nvALT\nUnbeatable note-taking app, featuring online syncing with the plain text notes web service, Simplenote, and the simplenote apps for iPhone and iPad.\nnvAlt is a fork of the existing application, Notational Velocity.\n\nA: Fantastical\nAmazing background app for quickly accessing and adding events to your mac's calendar.

Airfoil sends audio to remote speakers including iOS devices, other computers, and hardware devices like the Apple TV and AirPort Express. Airfoil for Mac gives you any audio, everywhere.\nBasically, what previously only iTunes could do (send audio to an AirPort Express) you can now do with all applications.\n\nA: Geektool\nGeektool allows you to put a tail of your syslog on the desktop, or the output of some command, or some graphic/chart/picture.\nIt's a bit like a more single-minded Dashboard for your desktop. You can make awesome clocks, or beautiful server monitoring, or just a fortune cookie (if you install fortune with HomeBrew).\nIt's not perfect (it would need sticky borders, continuous command output and sane multi-monitor behavior for that) but it's a lot of fun, using little resources.\n\nA: Alfred\n\nAlfred is a productivity application for Mac OS X, which aims to save you time in searching your local computer and the web. Whether it's maps, Amazon, eBay, Wikipedia, you can feed your web addiction quicker than ever before.\n\nIt's a wonderful piece because it enables you to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Increase your productivity by launching apps with shortcuts \n\n*Instant access to web searches, bookmarks & more\n\n*Browse and play music from your iTunes library quickly\n\n*Perform actions \u2013 copy, move & email files & folders\n\n*Ward off RSI \u2013 skip using the mouse with easy shortcuts\n\n\nA: Handbrake\nHandBrake is an open-source, GPL-licensed, multiplatform, multithreaded video transcoder.\n\nA: Adium\nAdium is a free instant messaging application for Mac OS X that can connect to AIM, MSN, Jabber, Yahoo, and more.

Zooom/2 brings the same functionality to Mac, and I can no longer live without it. For example, in my configuration I hold Shift-\u2318 and click anywhere in a window to move it. No more hunting for the menu bar or the resize corner!\n\nA: Minuteur\nQuick and easy to use timer. It's programmable, so you can do (10+2)*5 or the Pomodoro technique on repeating intervals.\nThe App is localized into English, but the linked webpage is French. The MacUpdate page is in English. \n\nA: Warp\nFrom the website:\n\nWarp is a preference pane that allows you to use the mouse to switch between Spaces rather than using the keyboard.\nWarp offers the ability to display a live preview of a space when you move the mouse to the edge of the screen, allowing you to see what you have on another space before actually switching to it. Clicking the preview will then warp you to that space.\n\n\nA: Alarms\n\nAlarms app is the reminder system you never knew your Mac was missing. Just drag the items you want to be reminded of to the Alarms menu and place them on the time line.\n\n\nA: Pow\n\nPow is a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X.

Final Cut Express is one step above iMovie, with up to 99 video tracks, 99 audio tracks, and 12 compositing modes. My favorite features of FCE are Chroma Key, Color Correction, and Livetype, which comes with Final Cut Express.\n\nA: DragThing\nis a utility that provides an alternative to the Dock. It is tremendously flexible and customizable in letting you design your own way to organize application launchers.\nLet me be frank; I've been using a Mac every day since 1987. I cannot live without DragThing because I could never get used to using the Dock, which appeared with the first Mac OS X circa 2000 (and I was using developer builds of Mac OS X before the first version went public). While you can configure DragThing to perform many functions, what I use it for is to provide an application menu and an application launcher that behave the same way they did in Apple Macintosh System 7 through Mac OS 9. That's the way I want it.\n\nA: Final Cut Express\nI am so amazed no one has mentioned this!\nThe best video editor for the price. Unfortunately Apple has abandoned FCE to go on to FCPX. I couldn't live without FCE!\n\nA: SecondBar\nSecondBar adds a second menu bar to your secondary monitor. Although there are a few bugs, it's a great little application.\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro\nAn indispensable macro tool. Trigger a macro based on a hotkey (overriding the frontmost app if appropriate), typed strings (a la TextExpander, the status of an app, the system waking or your logging in, at certain times or dates, etc. \nA macro can do pretty much anything you can do manually -- manage apps, choose menu items, click on windows or dialog boxes or whatever, display text or Growl or other notifications, etc. -- including running scripts. Macros can also include flow control (if, while, etc.) for less straightforward tasks (e.g. in Photoshop CmdDelete deletes the current layer if a layer is selected or the current group of layers if a group is selected).\nOne great use is unifying commands across apps, e.g. have Cmd- zoom out and Cmd= zoom in for every app that supports the concept rather than having to remember how, say, OmniGraffle does it vs Photoshop vs Numbers.\n\nKeyboard Maestro enables you to create or record custom macro shortcuts that you can activate at any time. For example, your macros could help you navigate runnings applications or work with an unlimited number of clipboards. Best of all, every macro you create is available using simple keystrokes you choose.\n\n\nA: Growl Extras - Hardware Growler, Growl Mail,...\nHardwareGrowler\nFind out when a hardware status changes on the Mac.\nGrowl Mail\nNotifications for incoming mail.\n\n\nA: \u00a0MarcoPolo\nMarcoPolo brings context-aware computing to your Mac! It allows your computer to determine its context through gathering evidence from your environment (evidence sources), using flexible rule-based fuzzy matching to make an educated guess (rules), and then performing arbitrary actions upon changing context (actions).\nI use MarcoPolo to run scripts (actions) when I arrive at work, as determined by WiFi hotspots detected or IP addresses assigned (context).\n\nA: teleport\nOkay, did a search of all eight pages posted to date, and didn't see \"teleport\" listed.\nThis little free System Preference gets installed on two computers, and then you can move your cursor off the screen of one, onto the screen of the other.\nI run a dedicated Mac Mini server, but my main computer is a Mac Pro. I have the server screen above the pro screen, and I can simply move my cursor up to the server, like you'd do with multiple monitors on the same computer. BRILLIANT!\nThis is so much simpler and easier than using Screen Sharing or other such tools.\nIt also copies the clipboard of one computer to the other. This can cause a significant delay if you have something huge on the clipboard.\n\nA: Simple Comic\nSimple Comic is the most intuitive comic reader on the Mac. Its clean interface gives you full control of your viewing experience without getting in the way. Reading comics on a computer has never been easier.\nA great program for looking any any set of archived images.\nSimple Comic viewer window http://dancingtortoise.com/simplecomic/images/screens/two_page.png\n\nA: Yep\n\n*\n\n*I scan all my documents to PDF and use Yep to track & find them.\n\n*No filing! Everything goes to a single target folder, Yep takes care of it.\n\n*Tag documents\n\n*Automatically finds all PDF, iWorks, Office, et.al. documents anywhere on your hard drive.\n\n*Does not use a database like some similar apps. So I can access documents via finder; move, copy, delete, etc. easily.\n\n*In conjunction with a Fujitsu Scan Snap scanner Yep is a dream to use.\n\n\nA: Tweetbot for Mac\nThough relatively new. Tweetbot for Mac is bringing the same innovation to the Mac platform that it's had established on iOS for a while now.\n\nA: EVE\nFrom website:\n\nEVE helps you to learn shortcuts, in order to increase your productivity with MAC OS X. Every time you execute an action using the mouse, EVE will show you the matching shortcut.\n\nGreat application! I use it with Cheatsheet.\n\nA: SparkleShare\nSparkleShare allows you to create your own DropBox. In this way you don't have to pay for more space, if you have your own server, and you don't have to share data with no one else (service provided) except the people you decide.\nHow does it work?\n\nSparkleShare creates a special folder on your computer in which\n  projects are kept. All projects are automatically synced to their\n  respective hosts (you can have multiple projects connected to\n  different hosts) and to your team's SparkleShare folders when someone\n  adds, removes or edits a file.\n\nWhy SparkleShare?\n\nThe idea of SparkleShare sprouted at the GNOME Usability Hackfest in\n  London, where a couple of designers came to the conclusion that they\n  didn't have a good (Open Source) collaboration tool to share their\n  work (for more background, read \u201cThe one where the designers ask for a\n  pony\u201d). They didn't like how the good collaboration tools were\n  proprietary, and that using them meant having to give up privacy,\n  control and other rights. What they needed was something that they\n  could run and control themselves, without having to depend on other\n  companies.\n\n\nA: Vienna\nViennna is a free open source RSS/Atom reader. Very flexible and version 3 will have Google Reader support.\n\n\nA: Glui\nI never really enjoyed using Skitch, even before Evernote bought them. Not too long ago I heard about Glui and have fallen in love ever since.\nIt's quick, provides some useful annotating tools, uploads to Dropbox and the automatically copies the share url to your clipboard.\nReally has improved my workflow as a programmer. Makes it super easy to share screens when working with others.\n\nA: Monosnap\nMonosnap is a free screenshot program for Mac OS X and Windows. The program allows users to create screenshots, annotate them and upload them to the cloud.\n\n\n\nA: Hub List\nVery promising successor of The Hit List.\nDescription: \nA HTML5 compliant productivity application\nFrom the author: \n\nHub List tries to strike a balance between simplicity and\n  customization. If you\u2019ve every managed a software project then you\u2019ve\n  probably spent more time then you care to admit inside an ugly bug\n  tracking application that a bunch of developers convinced you would\n  make them more productive. You probably use another app to manage your\n  business projects and then something else to help you remember all\n  those pesky personal todos like getting your mom a card for mother\u2019s\n  day. Rather than try to replace all those tools Hub List strives to\n  provide real-time two-way integration with all of them so you can be\n  more productive using the tools you already have.\n\nWebsite:\nhublistapp.com\n\nA: switchDiskSizeBase\nIn Mac OS 10.6 disk and file sizes are measured in base 10 (one kilobyte is defined as 1000 bytes, one megabyte is defined as 1000 kilobytes, etc.) in Finder and Disk Utility.  Unfortunately this has created a lot of inconsistency even when working with Apple\u2019s own programs since most of them still define file sizes in binary units (one kilobyte is defined as 1024 bytes, one megabyte is defined as 1024 kilobytes, etc.).  This utility will switch the measurement of disk and file sizes in both Finder and Disk Utility back to binary units (or if the measurement has already been switched to binary units it will restore the system back to using base 10 units).\nAfter the switch in Snow Leopard I never could get used to read file sizes in Finder with base-10. This application patches the Foundation framework in order to get back base-2 units. I can now again compare disk space and file sizes with other operating systems or output from shell tools.\n\nA: Podworks\nI recently referred to the app in this thread. If you own both a Mac and an iPhone or iPod, this application is a must-have.\nPodworks works around iTunes to allow transfer of media to/from Mac and iOS devices.\n\nA: iMote\nI use it mostly to rate songs and get Growl to display the currently playing song. From the website:\n\niMote is a simple, elegant, and lightweight program for controlling iTunes from just about any application. Play/pause, change tracks, select playlists, adjust volume, rate tracks, and more using fully customizable hot-keys or a universal menu bar item. iMote includes a beautiful iPod-esque floating window, indicating current track information, and Growl support if you want an even more streamlined experience with your other Growl-enabled applications. Written using Cocoa, iMote is lean and mean, consuming minimal system memory and CPU time. iMote is the original iTunes controller.\n\n\nA: News Anchor\nOne of the few RSS readers that doesn't try to imitate an e-mail application, News Anchor converts inanimate text in news feeds into lively television-like news broadcasts. With News Anchor you can now \"read\" news feeds while eating or doing other things.\n\n\nA: Vuze\nVuze, the most powerful bittorrent app on earth\n\nA: Monocle\nA great utility to make a web search (Google, Wikipedia, any other search engine) just a keystroke away regardless of what application I'm in.\n\nA: Livetype\nLivetype is an awesome title generator that came with FCE. It does have a rather steep learning curve if you aren't used to keyframing, but it generates professional-looking titles at a great price.\n\nA: Spark\n\nSpark is a powerful, and easy Shortcuts manager. With Spark you can create Hot Keys to launch applications and documents, execute AppleScript, control iTunes, and more...\nYou can also export and import your Hot Keys library, or save it in HTML format to print it.\nSpark is free, so use it without moderation!\n\nI use this all the time and love it!\n\nA: App bar\nApp Bar displays a quick list of all your applications. This is the quickest way possible to find and open any application launched from your Status Bar or Dock. All apps are listed alphabetical and the scroll list is well laid out and always just a click away.\n\nA: JiTouch\nJiTouch is similar to BetterTouchTool, but with many, many more options. The one thing it doesn't have is Windows 7 snapping, so keep BetterTouchTool around for that. I would highly recommend this application, though it's a paid application.\n\nA: Shimo - VPN management for the Mac\nReceive notifications via Growl. Assign network locations and wireless networks to profiles.\n\n*\n\n*CiscoVPN Support\n\n*OpenVPN Support\n\n*IPSec Support\n\n*PPTP/L2TP Support\n\n*Hamachi Support\n\n*SSH Support\n\n*Use Keychain for Passwords\n\n*Certificate Management\n\n*Advanced Notifications\n\n*Automatic (Re-)Connection\n\n*Syncing Profiles with MobileMe\n\n*Scriptable with AppleScript\n\n*Global Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n\n\nA: Sophos Anti-Virus Mac Home Edition\nFree commercial AV software.\n\n*\n\n*Fast signature updates\n\n*Low cpu usage\n\n*Live scan\n\n*Define custom scan scopes\n\n*Define action upon treat alert (log only, cleanup, move threat, delete threat)\n\n\n\nA: Scrawl\nScrawl is nifty little note taking app for the Mac that I made with iCloud support.\n\nA: iProcrastinate\niProcrastinate is the ideal task manager for anyone who doesn't want their todo list to get in the way of actually getting things done! Great for anyone who is looking for a mobile, easy-to-use task manager. (Not just for students!) Add birthdays, soccer practice and conference calls, all without missing a beat. \nUses iCloud to sync between Mac and iOS. Couldn't do my homework without it.\n\nA: AppCode\nFrom JetBrains, the makers of IntelliJ. Has a lot more refactoring support than XCode and a more powerful editor. Especially useful to anyone coming to iOS development from the Java world.\n\nA: Emacs 24\nBest text editor ever...Supports VIM bindings plus has org-mode and can run a shell, edit directories, view images, etc. Make sure to use the built-in package manager to load add-ons. Solarized-dark is an excellent color scheme.\n\nA: Herald\nAllow notification plugin for Mail.app. In ML you have notification center, but with Herald you also get the full message body which I really like. \n\nA: CCleaner\nOne of best cleaning utility.\nCCleaner is the no. 1 cleaning utility for Windows PC. In Mac it does the same function, cleaning temp files, cookies, cache etc. for making more space available. The tools section provides utilities to uninstall an application, change startup option, erase free space and manage permissions.\n\nA: SafeWallet\nSafeWallet is a very useful and complete password manager, which allows you to safely keep you passwords, credit card pins, notes, and many more stored on your Mac.\nIt also provides functionality for sharing your wallet with the iOS App (SafeWallet for iPhone). In this way your wallet is always with you and always synced. \n\nA: ControlPlane (free/open-source)\nThis application can trigger a wide range on actions based on different events, its mainly use being to start/stop application based on your context.\nFor example when you bring your laptop to work it can start Outlook. You can detect that you are at work based on the network IP, presence of a wireless network, or many other options.\n\nA: Debookee\nDebookee is a network traffic analyzer that allows you to see your traffic by protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, DHCP, DNS, SIP etc ...\nIt can also scan all the devices present on your network, and intercept the traffic of any of them, perfect to see what your iPhone or tablet is sending over the network.\n\nA: PogoPlug\nThere's a software version as well as the hardware box that creates a cloud server. The software version allows me to set a folder or drive on my Mac and link to it so I can let others access. I know there are other ways to do this, but for me the $20 ($30 now, I think) was well spent as the software is simple and no glitches.\nIf you have a good friend and you both agree to leave your computers running, you can use the other's extra drive to store your backup with no monthly fee, just install a decent size drive at the friend's house.\n\nA: Airmail\nAfter last year Sparrow acquisition from Google and development freeze, Airmail is new, actively developed mail client. It does not hide it's Sparrow roots, but exceeds it and new features are constantly added.\n\nA: Entropy\ndEntropy Logo http://bit.ly/16BItjE\nI use it as my daily productivity booster since it moves all files I haven't touched within the last week from my Desktop into my archive. It has many more features you may find interesting. Here is a trailer.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm the creator. Ask me anything. ;)\n\nA: Unclutter\nMain features:\n\n*\n\n*Instant, configurable access even in full screen mode\n\n*File Storage, to keep your Desktop clean from temporary files\n\n*Notes, your digital notepad\n\n*Clipboard preview, so you always know what you're about to share\n\n*Draggable cards that can stick on top of other windows\n\n*Retina display support\n\n\n\nA: Gimp\n\nVery powerful and free and open source image editor, inspired by PhotoShop. Has layers, RGB and indexed modes, and more tools and filters than you can shake a stick at.\nSince version 2.8 Gimp is OS X native.\nScreenshots - Features\n\nA: Fuzzyclock\n\"Often you don't need the exact time in hours, minutes and seconds. A more human readable style like \"five past ten\" makes more sense. For that, you can now use FuzzyClock. FuzzyClock is a menubar clock which displays the current time in a \"fuzzy\" style.\" I use the handwriting font.

{"text": "Q: How can I get DoubleTwist to differentiate between music and podcasts? Since iTunes has no way to sync with my Motorola Droid, and all of my music is on my Macbook Pro, I recently tried out DoubleTwist.  It detected my Droid right away.\nThe problem is that when I chose to sync all of my music, DoubleTwist also synced all of my podcasts, which quickly filled up my sd card with stuff I don't want on there.  Is there a way to have it only sync my iTunes music library and ignore podcasts?\n\nA: Judging by the screenshots, doubleTwist allows syncing specific playlists and has smart playlists.\nCreate a smart playlist that would contain all your library but not podcasts (excluding genre Podcast), and sync it.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}
{"text": "Q: Sync iPhone with multiple Macs Is it possible to sync an iPhone with multiple computers? I know the music will be restricted, and I don't mind. I want the contacts, bookmarks, etc. to be in sync across my home iMac and my MacBook.\n\nA: The best way to synchronize contacts and bookmarks between several Mac and/or iPhone is to use MobileMe (now iCloud). It will sync all as you need where you want.\n\nA: You actually don't have to buy MobileMe to sync contacts and calendar to multiple Macs and multiple iOS devices. This can be accomplished with only a free Google account. If you want more details on how to set it up, please ask.\nAs far as I know, there is no way to sync bookmarks without MobileMe.\n\nA: Actually, I just answered the question to how to keep your device's music library synchronized with 2 machines as well: Sync iTunes U between 2 Macs via an iPod\n\nA: One way to partly solve this (without paying for MobileMe) is by syncing certain data between different computers using Dropbox. (This approach was suggested in a Super User question about syncing home folders that I asked a year ago.)\nTo sync contacts, for example, share AddressBook's application data between your Macs like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the folder ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook (on the computer where you have the data) to your Dropbox.\n\n*On each computer you wish to sync, create a symlink from ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook to that folder in your Dropbox.\n\n\nThese screenshots show what the setup looks like on one of my computers:\n\n\n(If you need more detailed instructions, please let me know!)\nFor bookmarks, you'd need to share some Safari application data (I don't know which files/folders exactly as I haven't done that myself).\nObviously this isn't optimal, but once you set it up, it works pretty well. I think Apple is sooner or later going to provide better (cloud-based, even wireless) sync across multiple devices (also to those who're not paying extra for the service). Well, at any rate they should, as they are lagging behind Google quite badly in this respect.\n\nA: You can have your music synced to one computer and contacts synced to another - no problem.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/95", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}
{"text": "Q: Creating a new file blocks Textmate When I want to create a new file through the button (left-bottom one) in the project drawer or in the file menu it takes a long time and blocks TextMate and even blocks TextMate totally in some cases.\nI've installed the latest version of TextMate and installed all updates available for Mac OS X.\nAnyone any idea what the problem is?\n\nA: I just tested it with a couple of different massive projects on my MBP and it created a new file right away.\nFirst guess would be perhaps a bundle or other plugin you've added is interfering with the program operation somehow. You could also try trashing your Textmate preferences file and restart the program to see if that helps (~/Library/Preferences/com.macromates.textmate.plist).\n\nA: Do you have any external drives connected?  Certain external hard drives will go into some sort of dormant mode when they haven't been used in a while, and will block things until they spin back up.

{"text": "Q: What's the difference between Real, Virtual, Shared, and Private Memory? The different columns in Activity Monitor are a little confusing\n\nA: Real mem relates to physical memory (actual RAM modules in your computer).  Virtual Mem is how much \"fake\" memory is allocated to the process, meaning memory that is allocated on the permanent storage medium (hard drive, solid state drive, etc) for that process.  Shared memory is physical (Real) memory that can be shared with other processes.  Private memory is \"real\" memory that can only be used by the process it is allocated to.\nThese explanations may help as well... directly from activity monitor --> help --> viewing system memory usage:\nHere is an explanation of some of the information displayed at the bottom of the memory pane:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wired: Wired memory contains information that must always stay in RAM\n\n*Active: Active memory that contains information that is actively being used.\n\n*Inactive: Inactive memory contains information that is not actively being used. Leaving this information in RAM is to your advantage if you (or a client of your computer) come back to it later.\n\n*Used: Used memory is being used by a process or by the system.\nUsed memory is the sum of wired, active, and inactive memory. If the system requires memory it takes free memory before used memory.\n\n*Free: Free memory is not being used and is immediately available.\n\n*VM size: Virtual memory, or VM, is hard disk space that can be used as memory. VM size is the amount of disk space being used as memory. Mac OS X can use more memory than the amount of physical RAM you have. A hard disk is much slower than RAM, so the virtual memory system automatically distributes information between disk space and RAM for efficient performance.\nPage ins/outs: The number of gigabytes of information Mac OS X has moved between RAM and disk space\n\n\nA: Apple updated the Activity Monitor in OSX 10.9 (Mavericks). They have a good article about what everything means here http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5890. In summary...\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Physical Memory: The amount of RAM installed.\n\n*Memory Used: The amount of RAM being used and not immediately available for other apps.\n\n*Virtual Memory: The amount of memory mapping that apps have asked for. This is not an actual consumption of RAM resources and it size is determined by the author of the app.\n\n*Swap Used: The space on your drive being used to swap unused files to and from RAM. It is normal to see some activity and it is not a indication that you have depleted RAM resources. Seeing memory pressure in the Red state will indicate that RAM resources are depleted.\n\n*App Memory: The amount of space being used by apps.\n\n*Wired Memory: Memory that can\u2019t be cached to disk, so it must stay in RAM. This memory can\u2019t be borrowed by other apps.\n\n*Compressed: The amount of memory in RAM that is compressed, making more RAM resources available for other apps.\n\n*File Cache: The space in RAM marked as available for apps to use that contains recently used files.\n\n\n\nMemory Pressure graph\nThe combination of Free, Wired, Active, Inactive & Used memory statistics in previous versions of Activity Monitor have been replaced in Mavericks with an easy to read \"Memory Pressure\" graph.\nMemory pressure is indicated by color:\n\n\n*\n\n*Green \u2013 RAM memory resources are available.\n\n*Amber \u2013 RAM memory resources are being tasked.\n\n*Red \u2013 RAM memory resources are depleted and OS X is using the drive for memory.\n\n\nA: Taken from my answer at Server Fault:\nMac OS X Memory Jargon:\nWired : This refers to kernel code and such. Memory that should not ever be moved out of the RAM. Also know as resident memory.\nShared : Memory that is shared between two or more processes. Both processes would show this amount of memory so it can be a bit misleading as to how much memory is actually in use.\nReal : This is the \"real\" memory usage for an application as reported by task_info() - a rough count of the number of physical pages that the current process has. (RSIZE)\nPrivate : This is memory that a process is using solely on its own that is used in Resident memory. (RPRVT)\nVirtual : The total amount of address space in the process that's mapped to anything - whether that's an arbitrarily large space for variables or anything - it does not equate to actual VM use. (VSIZE)\nActive : Memory currently labelled as active and is used RAM.\nInactive : \"Inactive memory is no longer being used and has been cached to disk. It will remain in RAM until another application needs the space. Leaving this information in RAM is to your advantage if you (or a client of your computer) come back to it later.\" - Mac OS X Help\nFree : The amount of RAM actually available without any data.\n\nThe best documentation I know of (and have been able to find in followup research) is Apple's own Managing Memory article on their developer website.\nOther worthwhile sources: Darwin-dev mailing list: [1], [2] and an old article on MacOSXHints. Additionally Mike Ash has posted a good layman's introduction on his blog\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/104", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "77"}}

The MacBook Pro does a really good job keeping dirt and stuff from getting under the keys, but none-the-less there is some dirt under a few keys.

Removing it would require major surgery to remove. \nI recommend a can of air duster, some q-tips, and alcohol to clean the keyboard. \n\nA: Without knowing which specific model you are referring to it would be hard to tell. The keyboards on the newer unibody macbook pros are one assembly and it would not be advised to try to take off the keys. \n\nA: Yes - all keys on all mac portables in the past 10 years or so are individually removable.\nThere are very delicate plastic scissors hidden under the key caps. \nAlso - the scissors are not necessarily all oriented the same way. The return key may have two vertical scissors where an H key may have one horizontal scissors mechanism underneath. Also - the size of say a small arrow key may not be the same size as a function key at the top.\nLarge keys such as the space bar and the option keys have added metal supports and you may need a large amount of patience to get them back.\nIf you damage the very small delicate nubs - you will have broken that key and have to press the little rubber nubbin by hand until you can get a replacement.

{"text": "Q: Is there any way to print directly from my iPad to my wifi-connected printer? I am happy to purchase an app, but the only printing app I'm aware of seems to just let your ipad connect to a computer that is connected to the printer and effectively print through it.   \nI'm looking to print from my ipad without the use of another computer.   Both the ipad and the printer are on the same wifi network (which is how I print from our laptops).\nEDIT:  In my specific case, the printer is a Canon MP990.\n\nA: iOS 4.3 now offer AirPrint.\n\nA: \nIf you want to print pictures and\n  photos, you can use Epson iPrint\n  (there are similar apps from other\n  printer manufacturers, e.g. Canon\n  iEPP, HP iPrint Photo 2.0,\n  Kodak Pic Flick or Lexmark\n  LexPrint). For printing PDFs or\n  other documents, the already mentioned\n  \"print n share\", \"Print Bureau\"\n  (both from eurosmartz) or Air\n  Sharing Pro from Avatron could be\n  useful.\n\nVia piquadrat answering my similar question on gadgets.stackexchange.com.\n\nA: Canon made a utility for their printers called Easy-PhotoPrint.\nOtherwise, they are more generic utility like ePrint (but it's far more perfect or convenient).\n\nA: I have used the iPad part of PrintCentral with mixed results - I have a HP Color LaserJet 2605dn connected to an Apple Airport router. The printer is configured as 'A4' (I'm in the UK) and while some things print just fine from the iPad, other things seem to have pagination issues. Printing from emails and Safari generally seems okay.\nTo be fair I think that the only way you're going to get this to work seamlessly is if you can find a wifi printer with drivers for the iPad (do they even exist) - everything else is likely to be some kind of compromise.\nEDIT: Just to be clear, PrintCentral can either print directly to the 'network' printer, or can send data to an app on your Mac/PC. I haven't tried the latter approach (and your question says you don't want to do it that way anyway) - but I have used it to connect and directly print to my HP from the iPad.\n\nA: Have you tried Google Cloud Print? https://www.google.com/cloudprint/learn/apps.html\n\nA: The answer depends on what kind of printer you have.\nThe fundamental problem is printer drivers. That is why all of the apps use a server/proxy on a desktop computer, that way the can piggyback the desktops existing printer drivers. Otherwise they would need to include drivers for all supported printers.\nA few of the printer vendors have iPhone/iPad apps that can take to their network printers, but obviously those only support their printers (an usually only recent ones).\nI expect this to change at some point in the future (when Apple builds printing support into iOS), but this how things stand with iOS 3.2/4.0.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/110", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

I'm reposting this question (unchanged) from webapps.stackexchange.com, because I've received no answers there and this seems like an appropriate question for the Apple Stack Exchange site.\n\nI've tried the Shutterfly iPad app, which allows uploading photos, but doesn't support any other functionality available on the website. And I can't edit photos or design cards and books from the Mobile Safari browswer on the iPad, presumably because those features use Flash.\nAre there any other photo websites that provide either a full-featured iPad app (that includes creating cards and books and ordering prints) or an iPad or iPhone app that allows uploading photos and a website that allows one to create cards and books and order prints in Mobile Safari?\nNote, I download photos directly from my camera to the iPad, so I'm trying to figure out how to avoid any need for a PC.\nSomeone (on vark.com) recommended Apple's MobileMe (http://me.com).  But http://www.apple.com/mobileme/features/gallery.html doesn't show that it supports editing photos and ordering prints, cards, and books.  Does anyone have experience with MobileMe?\n\nA: I don't really have a direct answer for you, but I would like to help by sharing what I know.\nI have a Mobile Me account, and there are no tools for editing your photos online. It's an image gallery. A gallery is meant just for viewing and not for editing.\nMobile Me was designed to work in conjunction with the iLife software on a desktop mac. You edit the photos, order the prints, make the cards, and the books in the iPhoto app on the Mac.\nPhoto editing on the iPad is the easy part, but I think you are approaching it from the wrong angle. There are tons of free (and cheap) apps that allow you to edit photos. (Photoshop Mobile for instance. Just check the Photography category in the App Store). Once you edit them in an app, then I would upload them to a service that supports printing services. The hard part is going to be the ordering of prints, cards and books from the iPad.\nWe can only hope that sometime in the near future, Apple creates a mobile version of iPhoto just as they did with iMovie. That would be ideal.\nEDIT\n\n\n*\n\n*You can order prints from this app as well:\nhttp://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=323705153&mt=8%3FpartnerId%3D30&siteID=KEmRFwU0WKY-yY5rDqaKJMaSUWCfbLPC3w\n\n*You can also order prints from the Walgreens app:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/walgreens/id335364882?mt=8\n\n*This might solve your issue as well!\nhttp://www.ritzpix.com/net/OrderPrints/\n\n*You might want to check out this app and service:\nhttp://www.ecce-terram.com/order-solutions/mobile-client.html\n\nECCE TERRAM announced a new service this week that will allow people to order prints of photos stored on their iPhones from the phones themselves. With their Photo2lab Client, users may select a photo (both those taken with the iPhone and those transfered from iPhoto), add text and create prints, post cards and even mini photo books. You'll even be able to add an address to a post card from the iPhone's built-in contacts list.\n\n\nA: I downloaded the Walgreens app and emailed pics to my local store.  The only problem is if you edit your photos on the iPad, it doesn't transfer to the store.  So just use their browse and edit button, fix the pics there and create an album, send and pick up in hours.  So far this has worked.\n\nA: Only answer I can think of would be something like Phanfare loading up to flikr/Phanfare or via SmugMug and the smugshot app combined with the smugmug webpage (which is not mobile friendly, but isn't flash infested either).\n\nA: Just released.

{"text": "Q: What is the best media player for the mac (besides .mov - e.g., .mp3, .wmv, .avi, .mpg, etc) I've recently switched from PC to Mac, so I'm slowly building a library of useful utilities. So, any recommendations for the best generic media player?\nOn the PC - I've found the VLC player to be pretty useful - there's a Mac version, but I don't know how it compares to other alternatives.\nMany of the alternatives on the PC are full of crap - e.g., constantly pushing toolbars, add-ins, anti-virus junk, etc. \nSo, I'd like something lightweight and crapware free. I'd be happy to pay $20-$30 for something that was worth it.\n\nA: I like Movist. It has the format flexibility of VLC, but with a nicer Mac-like interface.\n\nA: I vastly prefer the experience of using Quicktime with a little help from Perian and Flip4Mac to give it compatability with 90% of the video I need to play. For the rare stubborn video that does not want to cooperate with that setup, I break out VLC, because of VLC can't play it, it's just not going to play.\n\nA: VLC is a nice player, but if you want something more Mac OS-like, try Lunettes (download link beta 8 is the last one at the time of writing).\nBasically, it's VLC rewritten fully in 64 bits and Obj-C.\nYou do not have to build it yourself ! Just extract the .app from the zip file, that's all.\n\nA: VLC is by far the best. \nFast, extensible, and versatile. You can play just about any format video, Video_TS file, remote disks, remote streams, even pipe the output of a command into it to play. Can you say on the fly video manipulation? That's VLC.\nNot to mention the main selling point, it's free.\nQuicktime? Slow. Plugins? Hokey. Alternatives? Either not very \"native\" or buggy, slow, and prone to crashing. There is not one thing I have been unable to play with VLC that I had to use something else.\nOkay, one thing. The MKV support on it is a bit of a pain. Try seeking with a 4GB MKV file. \n\nA: VLC is best media player in OS X too. and it's free also.\nbut if you install perian in your mac (it's free too) I suggest use QuickTime. peran it's component for Quicktime to support many extension for media on mac.\n\nA: I can only agree regarding VLC. It's best. I've tried quite a few (MplayerX, MplayerOSX, QuickTime and some others), since the UI is, just like on Windows, ugly and non-slick, but it still win by far.\nWhat I like the most are all the keyboard shortcuts for everything. Currently my standard setup is to use VLC together with AirFoil. The problem then is of course the 2 second delay for sound to the AirPort Express, this is however easy to solve with the f key, delay sound 2000 ms (g reduces the delay). Or if you get hold of some subtitle that totally out of sync, use h and j to delay the text. I use this all the time. None of the others I tried have easy (if any) access to these features, and thus make the unusable for me and my lovely AirPort Express setup at home.\n\nA: I like VLC, but I end up using Mplayer OSX Extended more often. I find the default shortcut key mappings to be more intuitive. And it's as versatile as VLC in terms of file format compatibility.\n\nA: VLC really do a good job, but sometimes it fails me when dealing with some Blu-ray issue. I do a lot of homework on this, finally I got Macgo Blu-ray player. I won't say it's the best or perfect,  while it meets my needs currently. There is a little friction in the playing of one disc but no big deal.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/122", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}

{"text": "Q: Is it generally advisable to get anti-virus software for Mac OS X? Is it worth to buy an anti-virus software for Mac OS X?\nI heard both opinions like \"it's not possible to get a virus on Mac OS X\" and \"Mac OS X is also vulnerable against virus... \"\nWhich is true? What is the accepted practice, if any? Under what circumstances would anti-virus be advisable?\n\nA: The simple fact is that malware has always existed for Mac OS (OS X and macOS), so the statement that a Mac can't get malware is patently, demonstrably and dangerously false.\nA second fact is that Apple has done a good job with technology to make the macOS ecosystem largely immune to most threats. This \"immune system\" consists of sandboxed application design, entitlements to let developers express intent when they need out of the sandbox, signed code to prevent modifications that turn a known app malicious, App Store distribution, system integrity protection, XProtect file quarantine mechanism with a free online update service.\nHistorically and for many years; the scarcity of viruses, trojans and other malware that spread widely or affect a broad cross-section of Mac users has contributed to a perceived complacency about good security hygiene. The good news, is macs have a built in multi-layered defense system against virus and trojan/malevolent software. This means that most of the recent exploits rely on people unintentionally sabotaging themselves by self-defeating built in defenses. With a small investment of time, you can significantly decrease the need for additional anti-virus protection on OS X.\nThe calculus of whether running a specific antivirus package is a moving target (vendors typically react to bugs and threats - so what was true yesterday may not be true tomorrow). This makes general answers about the merits of software easily out-dated in a month's time (let alone the two and a half years that have passed since this question was first asked).\nWhat hasn't changed for decades, is that each user should at least spend some time thinking about what is on their device and how painful total compromise might be to them. Based on how valuable your time is to you, it would be silly for someone that has paid IT staff to advise them to not spend $1,000 extra dollars on evaluating security to include potentially installing anti-virus software. It would also be silly for a casual home user to pay for software rather than invest some time to mitigate known risks in their behavior in response to a healthy fear of the unknown.\nThere are many cases where additional anti-virus protection is critically important. There are also many cases where it is totally un-needed. I would recommend anyone browse these few Apple knowledge base articles to gauge their \"baseline security aptitude\" and then reach out and learn more before spending any money on anti-virus software1.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use gatekeeper, automatic updates to apps and system files and malicious lists for quarantine.\n\n*Protect your computer from harmful applications - the very basics\n\n*Safety tips for handling email attachments and content downloaded from the Internet - a good primer on attachments and executable code \n\n*Apple ID: Tips for protecting the security of your account - great tips on account hygiene, applicable for all online accounts\n\n*Safari: Using encryption and secure connections - starts with the basics, but gets technical quickly. Perhaps better is about certificates to get started.\n\n\nMy only critique of the above articles would be the admonishment to frequently change passwords. This is of limited value when you start making unique passwords and don't as a matter of course enter those passwords on other computers. Changing passwords is of little use when your using them on compromised computers, since the new password is stolen as easily as the old one was.\nOnce you've mastered the basics, you should have absorbed the following ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*how to use the OS X keychain for storing passwords\n\n*considered or implemented having a few distinct passwords\n\n*and have started securing your account passwords as well as your computer (by applying the tips on Securing Apple ID to other accounts)\n\n\nAfter the basics, now it's time to think about increasing your overall security by spending money on anti-virus or a good unique password generation toolset2 to automate secure storage of stronger, unique passwords. \nWithout being proficient at the level of involvement in the linked articles above, spending money and potentially adding instability or slowness from anti-virus software might not make sense for many users. Furthermore, Apple is clearly intent on getting ahead of this problem with the one-two punch of the App Store model where spreading unsafe software installation practices is clearly working with GateKeeper to allow most people to have automated warnings when code is not signed to prevent tampering and assist in tracing the source of malware.\nFor most Mac users on Lion, the correct answer is to keep running anti-virus if you have it but not to run out and get it unless you have a good reason to spend time and money after getting up to speed on the basics of security.\nSince Lion, Apple has hardened the OS faster than bad actors have been able to exploit the OS so for most people and most businesses, not needing additional software as your default option is a sane and probably correct choice.\n\n1 especially with the likes of Mac Defender preying on people looking for legitimate anti-virus software\n2 like 1Password\n\nA: There is anti-virus software available for Mac OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intego VirusBarrier\n\n*ClamXAV (Free)\n\n*Norton AnitVirus Mac Edition\n\n*McAfee VirusScan for Mac\n\n*Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac (Consumer Version is free)\n\n\nIs it worth it? That's largely up to you. Personally I'd say unless required there's no reason to so long as you practice \"safe computing\" (eg. not opening files from just anywhere, being aware of what is installed on your computer, etc.). However there are some companies that require any computer (regardless of OS) to have up to date anti-virus software installed and operational.\nThere are no viruses available for Mac OS X but there are several pieces of malware and trojan horses that a user must manually download and install. The anti-virus products (and actually a feature in Mac OS X Snow Leopard) will help fight against these threats but the primary defence is actually user education as the attack vector is primarily social engineering and not using any security hole.\n\nA: There is a nice article on Mac.Appstrom from yesterday about antivirus on Mac OS X (which ones and do we need them).\n\nA: Another possible reason install an antivirus software on a mac could be the protection of systems running other operation systems in a heterogenous network. A virus or malware could reside on a mac drive for several time, until it is activated by an other system, on which it can run.\nTherefore it may make sense to install anti-virus software on all computers in a network, to keep the whole network clean.\n\nA: Arriving lately after the legitimate rising of this question I'd like to add here a return on many years and many OSes regular attacks.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no Tchernobyl frontier (in 1986, French government\nannounced publicly that the Tchernobyl radioactiv cloud wouldn't\ncross the country frontiers. Since this official public lie, I name\nwith this metaphor any form of false official security barrier)\nto protect MacOS X: we live under the same probability\n(all\noperating systems are born equal with approximately the same coding\nerrors ratio:\nthey are written by us humans who are error prone).\n\n*There are many attacks targeting specifically Symantec AntiVirus\nfor 2 reasons (I'm refering here to the huge number of external\nattacks I see on our external firewall targeting 2967/tcp and\n38293/udp =\nports used by Symantec anti-virus.):\n\n\n*\n\n*(too many security defaults) \u00d7 (too many people using it) = good target for cybercriminals\n\n*many versions of Symantec AntiVirus failed to install or run\non a case sensitive filesystem which is the sign of a weak\nquality control.\nTo say it bluntly, a vulnerable anti-virus (Symantec) installed on a\nrobust operating system (MacOS X), may render this last one\nvulnerable.\n\n*Many attacks are targeting directly us (the human seated\nbehind the keyboard), either through booby trapped\nweb servers or HTML formatted E-mail hidding URL toward\nthese booby trapped web servers\nThe 2 best anti-viruses I'm using on many versions of MacOS X are:\n\n\n*\n\n*clamav\n\n*ClamXav\nAs their name lets guess it, they are based on the same engine.\nIt is pretty good quality software, updated very quickly, and running also on many other Unixes. On some new crapware detected clamav included them within less than 72 h where commercial products took a quiet week (just enough time stop to get many thousand computers infested).\nI also appreciate Sophos, because it is running on different OSes, does install and run on a case sensitive filesystem (which is the sign of a serious quality control).\n\nA: Probably goes without saying, but if you run any version of Windows in a VM within OS X, those installs of Windows will need antivirus software on them. A surprising number of people I've worked with (including, on one occasion, a head of IT) haven't thought of that.\n\nA: No, it's not worth it to buy any antivirus software for your Mac. This is for two reasons. Firstly, the number of viruses in the wold for OS X is infinitesimal. Your risk is extremely low, and what viruses do exist, are mostly proofs of concept or MS Office Macro Viruses targeting old versions of Office.\nThe second reason is because for what antivirus needs you do have, ClamXAV is lightweight, effective, and free. So no, it's not worth purchasing. But it is absolutely worth using, and if you can spare a few bucks for the tip jar, I'd encourage you to do that as well.\n\nA: Apple is excellent and keeping up with patching the few Mac vulnerabilities that do arise, so anti-virus isn't necessary as long as your not foolish enough to fall for blatant trojans.\nHOWEVER if you have a Windows PC with which you share files, it may be worth running anti-virus on your mac to prevent yourself from unintentionally spreading Windows viruses (which are otherwise harmless to Macs).\nNote that all anti virus programs for mac are either a hoax or simply check for Windows viruses to prevent unintentional spreading of viruses while file sharing.\n\nA: I personally use Sophos. The company I work for uses Sophos with 20,000+ computers, and the Mac version is free for consumer use. I have not had any problems with it running on my machines. It scans relatively quickly, and runs faster & better than any Norton product I've ever used. \n\nA: Viruses are so 80's. The big money is user information, this is where big companies make a lot of money, like Google Ads. Also Known As Spyware. \nViruses started as a joke, a prank, a way for coders to have fun. Viruses flourished on Microsoft platforms like DOS and Windows because Microsoft never really cared about its customers other than how to sell more and make more money. \nMacOS X is a Unix based OS. Unlike Windows, a file cannot do whatever it wants. If it tries to modify your hard disk in any way, outside the home folder, it needs permissions. Permission you give. That makes life, for a virus, seriously hard. Because the goal of a virus is not just to infect your files, that means nothing, it's there to infect your system to infect your OS. To take control of your OS. That's the end goal. \nIt's not impossible to hack an OS like MacOS X, but Apple is not stupid and, unlike Microsoft, it cares - because safety and reliability is what it sells. \nI have owned an iMac for 7 years and I've never had the problems I had with Windows. I see little reason to install a piece of software that will slow down my CPU and offer me zero benefits. \nThere is no such thing as safety, safety is an illusion. As a matter of fact I have caught viruses on Windows several times using an anti-viruses that was full updated. \nIf you want real safety, disconnect from the internet and install nothing. This is the only way to be sure. \nWhat seriously annoys me, and one of the big reasons I left Windows for good, was that Microsoft created this culture of \"getting a virus is what happens for an OS\" like its something normal. It's not normal, it's a serious flaw in the design of the OS, a flaw that survives because customers tolerate it as \"normal\". \nDo not install anti-viruses, you paid for your OS, demand from its publisher to deliver an OS that does what is reasonable to expect to keep you and your files safe. Viruses and malware are unacceptable. \n\nA: \nDo you need an Antivirus Software on OS X?\nYes, yes you do need some sort of antivirus app for your Mac OS X and my reason for saying that is simple. Viruses exist for every known Operating System. It is true that Apple\u2019s Operating system for Macs is safer and more naturally protected against Viruses but the REAL truth is that Mac systems are not as popular as the Windows OS so those that make viruses don\u2019t see a need to program viruses for Macs when most desktop users in the world still operate on a Windows OS. So my point is, it is better to get a good Antivirus for your Mac computer now because sooner or later, as OS X becomes more user friendly, more and more viruses will appear...\n\nThat's how I look at it too, you can never be too safe.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/141", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "51"}}
{"text": "Q: StartupSound.prefPane on new iMacs? Inspired by this question to which I thought I knew the answer, does anybody know how to make StartupSound.prefPane work on a new iMac?\nI just got the computer last week, and installed SS.pP (v1.1b3) right away, but noticed the next day that it didn't actually function.  However, it appears to work, in that it installed fine in System Preferences, I can access it, check and uncheck its options, and move its slider, all without receiving warnings or errors of any kind.  Whatever configuration I set is remembered the next time I go into the app, even after a reboot.  Nevertheless, the startup sound is still played when I boot up.\nEdit: Are others having the same issue?  I'd be interested to know if this is a consistent problem with new iMacs or some quirk in how I've set mine up...\n\nA: Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure you're out of luck.

{"text": "Q: Opening a new Terminal window when it's running on another desktop I open a lot of terminal windows. I also make use good use of tabs & multiple desktops.\nNormally I launch Terminal.app with Spotlight. But if Terminal is already running on another desktop, it changes to that desktop and opens it there. I hate that. I want it to open on the current desktop.\nSo for now, I've been doing this:\n\nIs there a better way?\n\nA: By Golly, I think I've found it this time.\nFire up Utilities/AppleScript Editor. Copy/paste the lines below. Save it and add it to your Dock. Whenever you click it you'll get a new window on your current desktop. You need to have \"Enable support for assistive devices\" activated in System Preferences - Universal Access. \ntell application \"Terminal\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Terminal\"\n        click menu item \"New Window\" of menu \"Shell\" of menu bar 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nSource: adapted from this hint regarding Safari.\n\nA: I looked far and wide and found no better way myself. I usually have less than 5 Terminal windows open, and I usually don't want to switch desktops for Terminal, so in System Preferences - Expose - Spaces I assigned Terminal to be in Every Space so as to follow me around. You might hate that though.\n\nA: You can create a new service using automator (from the applications folder). At the top of the automator window, enter: Service receives 'no input' in 'any application'. Then, in the workflow, add 'Run applescript'. Make the applescript contain the following:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        do script \" \"\n        activate\n    end tell\n\n    return input\nend run\n\n(You can add any command you like into the do script line between the \" \" (e.g. something useful to run when terminal first opens like \"uptime\" if you like, or just leave it blank).\nSave the service as 'Open Terminal' or whatever name you like. It should now appear in your services menu.\nThen if you want to add a keyboard shortcut, you just need to go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts tab, select services in the left hand menu, and find your new service (its probably near the bottom). Just click in the space to the right of your service name, and assign it whatever keyboard shortcut you like, and hey presto! it should all work\n\nA: You can tell the system to stop switching spaces \"automagically\" based on what App comes to the foreground:\n# don't switch spaces\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO\nkillall Dock\n\nThis is an important setting if you view each Space as its own workspace, and might have a Terminal window and a web browser window open in each space.

{"text": "Q: What are the benefits of iPhone jailbreak? Some days ago I read a news that said iPhone Jailbreak is legal. So I get 2 question in my mine.\n\n\n*\n\n*before this news jailbreaking was illegal?(if yes why? \"because when we buy something we can do anything we want with that product )(and if no then what was this news for?)\n\n*what is the benefits of jailbreaking? (are all iPhone applications was reachable through iTunes app store?)\n\n\nA: I Jailbroke my iPhone 4 as soon as the jalibreak was released and had my iPhone 2G Jailbroken before that.\nFor me it's not about illegally installing applications, it's about intsall tweaks and applications which Apple can't or won't allow into their App Store, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Winterboard:     Complete themeing system.\n\n*SBSettings:      Easily enable/disable settings from within\nany application.\n\n*Infinifolder:        Remove the 12 Application limit from iOS4 Folders.\n\n*QuickReply SMS:      Reply to SMS messages directly from the message\nalert with a popup keyboard and then\ninstantly return back to what you\nwere doing.\n\n*Cyntact:     Show contact pictures in Contacts.\n\n*BossPaper:       Rotating wallpapers (Was available before iOS 4 allowed\nthem)\n\n*Categories:      Allowed Apps in folders years before iOS4 did!\nThe few short weeks I had my iPhone 4 without it being Jailbroken I found it hard to use as I'd got so used to the small tweaks I'd installed my Cydia, most of them I had purchased.-\n\nA: I jailbroke my iPhone 4 few weeks ago, specifically for the MyFi, which allows you to tether your 3G connection to your other WiFi-enabled devices (iPad, laptop, etc), without paying $20 to AT&T every month and being limited by 2Gb of data. MyFi is $19.99, but you pay it once and enjoy free tethering after that, especially if you kept your $30 unlimited data plan (I did).\n   Initially beyond that I saw very little reason to use other apps from Cydia store, but now I slowly changing my mind, since I found few real gems.\n\n\n*\n\n*SBSettings - gives you quick panel to toggle WiFi, Bluetooth, 3G and few other functions. This is extremely handy, especially when you're trying to preserve your battery (long day on the conference or something) and you don't want to dive into Settings each time you want to turn WiFi on or off. SBSettings is free\n\n*Notified Pro - this is notification management done right. Notifications have horrible usability in iOS and this app ($4.00 for Pro version, but I think they have the light one for free as well) fixes it by introducing notifications list similar to one Android has, which you can activate from status bar or via other customized shortcuts\n\n*Frash - which is Flash for iPhone, right in your mobile Safari. Frankly I haven't use it for anything serious yet (and it doesn't support my favorite Flash game Quadradius), but it's a good app to wow your friends, since everyone knows that there's no Flash on the iPhone and you can always prove people wrong.\n\n*My favorite app IntelliScreen - it's a paid app as well, but it's extremely handy. It gives you a highly customizable lock screen very similar to Windows Mobile's Today screen, so you can look at your calendar, emails, SMS and other info without even unlocking your phone. Really, really handy.\nOne other thing that I didn't try personally yet, but going to soon is sync with your PC or Mac over WiFi. I hate to do it over a cable.\nNow, on the bad side:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to be more careful and knowledgeable about stuff you're installing. That includes both apps (which are, in general, more buggy and may conflict with each other or with iOS) and stuff like official Apple iOS updates that you can't install unless you know that there's a jailbreak for them.\n\n*Cydia store (and others like RockYou app store) are less informative than AppStore and quite often it's hard to figure out what certain app does\n\n*Payment (while they allow multiple ways including AMazon payments and PayPal) is usually much more painful\n\n*Apps quite often are more expensive (think $4.99-$9.99 range), but on the bright side they worth it\n\nA: As to your first inquiry, Jailbreaking was illegal because of the way the Digital Millenium Copyright Act restricts the circumvention of encryption, copy protection, and other digital security mechanisms. In short, it is not so much the possession of a jailbroken phone which was illegal, but rather the process by which the phone was jailbroken. A common analogy is to liken the DMCA's restriction to a law preventing the crossing of red lines in the road. If there is a public park on the other side of the red line, it is legal for you to be there, but illegal to walk across the line to get there. The recent LoC ruling essentially created an exception to the DMCA's restriction for the specific purpose of jailbreaking a phone for the purpose of installing additional software and expanding it's functionality.\nNow, as to Why Jailbreak? In short, Jailbreak if there is an application you want to run which requires you to jailbreak. Apps available through Cydia and other repositories available to Jailbroken iPhone owners run the gamut from those rejected by Apple because they violate the App Stores Terms of Service in some way (Explicit content, use of hidden or illegal API's), apps from authors who disagree with Apples policies in administering the App Store, and apps which rely on functionality only available from other jailbreak apps.\n\nA: Here's the same question from gadgets.stackexchange.com. Lotsa good info in that post as well.\niOS4 really has circumvented the \"need\" to jailbreak. The reasons are actually dwindling now. Here are my advantages.\n\n*\n\n*Backgrounder allows a (now outdated) type of multitasking. It was ok on iPhone 3G, but with the iPad's more powerful processor, it may be more stable. Once 4.0 is released for the iPad, this won't be necessary any more.\n\n\n*MyWi allows you to tether for free if you've got the 3G iPad ($9.99 for the app...$19.99 for 4.0, but well-worth it IMO)\n\n\n*For me, it's cool to have access to the filesystem. Utilities like Mobile Terminal, OpenSSH, and iFile are of specific interest to me just for my own nerdish pleasures lol.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: The Benefits of Jailbreaking are that you can run any software that was created for it, regardless if it was rejected from the Apple\u2019s App Store. Some good applications were rejected for different reasons (using Private APIs, Confilcts with existing Apple apps, etc). \nIf you Jailbreak your iPhone/iPodTouch you can install any of these, bypassing the iTS.\nEDIT: The legal part has been nicely explained by LessPop_MoreFizz.\n\nA: Jailbreaking your phone lets you use non AT&T sim cards in it. If you go overseas to the Czech Republic or to Germany, for example, you can buy pre-paid sim cards in those countries and continue using your iphone if it is jailbroken. \n\nA: For me jailbreaking allowed me to install an app not allowed on the App Store - AutoSilent.  I needed this as a drop of my iPhone (1G) left the silent switch permanently set to silent.  AutoSilent allowed me to bypass this.\n\nA: I jailbreak because of Wifi Tethering and WinterBoard.\n\nA: Facetime over 3G and tethering are the only reasons to jailbreak an iPhone 4.  Multitasking is the only reason to jailbreak an iPad.\nIts legal, but make sure you restore the device before you bring it to a genius bar.  Apple employees don't have to honor the warranty or applecare if they see that the device is jailbroken.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/149", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}

{"text": "Q: Is it possible to add alternate SCM options in Xcode 3? Is it possible to add additional SCM options in Xcode, specifically Mercurial?  I know it is possible outside with Murky and others but I was hoping for a \"inside Xcode\" integration.\nIf this is too SOish say so.\n\nA: In the latest beta of XCode 4, there's a built-in support for Git, so it's possible to add other SCM.\nMaybe Apple will also incorporate Mercurial support as well.\nThey are several requests - XCode should support Mercurial as well as Git., Xcode 4 should support Mercurial - to put Mercurial support into XCode.\nSo if you can't find a solution now, I'd suggest you to wait until XCode 4 goes out officially.\n\nBy the way, if you need or want a nice Mac OS X client for Mercurial, you should try MacHg.\n\nA: The lack of XCode plugins is due to the fact that apple doesn't document XCode's plugin interface in public. That makes writing XCode plugins very hard. To increase the chance for a future  Mercurial plugin you could file a dupe of Documentation and opening of the Xcode plug-in API (.xcplugin and family) which is dupe of rdar://3037631.\n\nA: As far as I know, it\u2019s not possible to add support for mercurial using Xcode alone. \nYou have to use an external tool (Like Murky).

{"text": "Q: How can I use an ADB Apple Keyboard with a modern Mac? I recently found an old Apple Extended Keyboard that uses the ADB interface. I would like to use it, but I don't have an ADB-to-USB converter. I know of only one which is the Griffin iMate. Unfortunately, it's out of production and the ones going on ebay are expensive. \nAnyone know of another company that made the ADB-to-USB converters? Even better if they still do!\n\nA: The iMate was the only converter available on the market.\nIf you do get an iMate, the only thing it will work with these days are keyboards and mice. It internally converts ADB keyboard and mice commands to USB keyboard and mice commands, so it will just make your ADB mouse and keyboard look like a USB mouse and keyboard to the computer, no drivers required.\nIn ~2001 there was a driver for the iMate that would actually configure it as an ADB bus the computer could see, that way anything with real ADB drivers could use it just like a builtin port. That driver has not been updated in years, and Apple dropped all ADB support from OS X, so at this point USB emulation is the only thing it does. Not that there were many (any?) interesting ADB devices that were supported under Mac OS X anyway.\n\nA: Find a matching vintage CPU, install an old linux on it with ADB drivers, and then send the resulting keystrokes over IP.\nOr you could buy a nice new low-profile aluminum Apple keyboard. It'll be cleaner, more comfortable, and cheaper.\n\nA: FYI there appears to be another USB to ADB adapter out there as well Micro Connectors USB ADB Adapter. Good luck with your search.\n\nA: ADB is over ten years old. \nI would highly doubt anyone is still making a converter for it. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/173", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

What are your favorite keyboard shortcuts on Mac OS X?\n\nA: For me the life saving shortcut is the quarter increment/decrement of light/sound:\n\u21e7+\u2325 and the increment/decrement light or sound button.\nIt is extremely useful with LED Cinema Display monitors.\n\nA: \u2318+E: Put selected text into search clipboard.\nThen \u2318 + G to find next.\nIn combination with regular copy-paste you can do selective search and replace very quickly and conveniently.\n\nA: Here's a great one (for switchers) I got from the TextMate blog;\nCreate the folder ~/Library/KeyBindings (if it doesn't already exist)\nIn there, create a key-binding file DefaultKeyBinding.dict\nIn that file, put this text (including all braces & punctuation);\n\n{\n    /* home */\n    \"\\UF729\"  = \"moveToBeginningOfLine:\";\n    \"$\\UF729\" = \"moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:\";\n\n    /* end */\n    \"\\UF72B\"  = \"moveToEndOfLine:\";\n    \"$\\UF72B\" = \"moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:\";\n\n    /* page up/down */\n    \"\\UF72C\"  = \"pageUp:\";\n    \"\\UF72D\"  = \"pageDown:\";\n}\n\nSave the file, and when you next start a Cocoa app (eg Mail, TextEdit etc) you will find that Home, End, Pg Up and Pg Down now work as they do on Windows.\nIt's well worth having a look at the whole of that article - he explains exactly how to make this file and how the bindings work, with information about the other keycodes etc.\n\nA: \u21e7+\u2318+?: Help->Search, then type any menu item text, can be just a prefix\n\u2318+E: put selected text in search dialog\n\u2318+G and \u21e7+\u2318+G: find next/previous\n\u21e7+\u2303+\u2318+4: Take a screenshot, press space for whole window screenshot\nctrl + mouse scroller: zoom screen\n\u2325+\u2318+\u23cf: sleep\n\nA: *\n\n*ctrl+A: Go to the beginning of the line (works in every Cocoa textfield)\n\n*ctrl+E: Go to the end of the line (works in every Cocoa textfield)\n\n*\u2318+\u21e7+H : Pop up the Home folder\n\n*\u2318+\u21e7+D : Pop up the Desktop folder\n\nA: ctrl+F2: Access the menu via the keyboard (Windows alt+space equivalent).\n\nA: Typing / on any file dialog will give you a \"go to folder\" dialog, which autocompletes with tab (you have to wait a second for it to work).

{"text": "Q: What hardware upgrade would be most beneficial for a Mac? Would it make more sense to buy a Mac with a better processor, or with a better graphics card, or a SSD?\nFor general computer use, mainly word processing and Chrome/Safari.\n\nA: Do you plan to buy an iMac or a MacBook ?\nIf you buy a MacBook, you should take a SSD because it's better for a portable device (more resistant).\nIf you buy an iMac, SSD is not really necessary because you don't move your computer every day, so you can take a better processor and/or RAM.\nIf you don't manage to choose, juste take a better processor and a SSD :)\nHope this helps !\n\nA: The speed gains from an SSD drive are awesome, but they're still much more expensive.\nAlso, OS X always sees significant boosts from adding RAM, so get as much as you can afford (but not from Apple!).\n\nA: Given those three I say processor. \nGiven an alternate option I say processor then RAM. Always buy the most \"powerful\" processor you can at the time. You're probably going to keep the computer for a few years. With upgrades and new versions coming out it is hard to stay on top. Might as well be as close to the top as possible to start with. \nOS X and some programs (cough Firefox) love RAM. Get the stock amount and upgrade later.\n\nA: For general computing the most \"bang for your buck\" would come from RAM as tonklon states. Get as much as you can given your budget and specs on the computer. The next item would be up the hard drive to SSD. \nThis can get quite expensive but I've heard nothing but good things about certain SSD drives. \nIf cost not an issue then do both. If it is then upgrading RAM is your best bet. Keep in mind that Safari is a memory HOG. I've seen it take over 1G of RAM with just a few browser tabs open.\nDefault graphics card should be more than adequate for your stated needs.\n\nA: My suggestion is to always take the second fast processor available and invest the rest of your budget in RAM. The fastest processor is usually too expensive. You don't get much more speed for the price difference between the fastest and second fast.\nAnd don't upgrade the RAM in the Apple Store. Find a local reseller, who delivers your System readily build with non-apple brand RAM with warranty. You could get twice the RAM for the same price. But never ever use discount RAM. It's not worth the hassle. \nEDIT Oct 12:\nbmike's comment is right. The SSD is right now the single most important component for your Mac's speed.\nSo take the SSD. Even if you can then only afford the slowest processor.\nBTW. Are there still Mac models w/o SSD?\n\nA: I've found RAM and SSD are usually the ways to go. However, it depends upon your current configuration. If you currently only have 1gb or less of RAM, then you should definitely load up on RAM at the expense of other things (if there need be a tradeoff). But if you've got 2gb already, then SSD will likely do much more for you (given your stated needs).\n\nA: As Jeff Atwood says in his post, \"no CPU or memory upgrade can come close to touching that kind of real world performance increase\" as an SSD.\n\nA: SSD and RAM for me. But buy them from OWC or Crucial. Don't use the Apple one! And second display is always a nice upgrade, even a small 7 inch USB display. \n\nA: Consider that Hard drive is a bottleneck (physical speed) and limited ram enforces the usage of the Hard Drive (swap!). With those two parameters, you need to find a balance between the two.\nIf you get 32GB of RAM, yes, you will be using a \u201cslow\u201d hard drive, but the swap to drive will be close to zero. If you go with less ram but an SSD, those swapping times will be way way faster. \nI\u2019d chose memory over anything else, because swap is not a substitute for RAM, and no free RAM = bad things occur. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: Why iTunes updates get released so fast and why everytime the entire iTunes has to be updated instead of patched? I use iTunes on my Mac (OS X 10.6) but I wonder what's up with it's update.\nI really want know Why iTunes updates get released so fast and why everytime the entire iTunes has to be updated instead of patched.\nP.S: I have limited bandwidth with my internet then the size of update was important for me.\n\nA: The reason why they release patches so often, iTunes is the app where all their management of iPhone and iPad occurs, which means they often need to update it to add support for new iPhone/iPad/iPod touch models, and to support new features in those products. The fact that it is also where they handle a lot of their DRM (which they may have contractual obligations to update in some instances) probably is part of the reason as well.\nThe fundamental issue with delta patches is that they are more complex, and have higher support costs for the vendor. A full updater can run against any version of the app that is installed, a delta patcher most be made against specific version. A full updater will work regardless of whether the app has been modified (user hacking the binary to do something, tweaking the artwork, etc), a delta updater will fail against a modified app.\nGiven the extra work involved in preparing a delta patch, and the increased chance that it won't work, they tend to only be used in very specific cases. Apple tends to create delta updates for software updates, but they only create a delta against the most recent released version of the OS, rather than making dozens of versions that work with every release they make the one that will get most people, and then for everyone else they do a combo update that is a full updater that also incorporates every previous software update as well.\nFor smaller things like iTunes, they don't tend to bother with delta updates at all due to the increased workload, support, the increased number of versions that exist, and the fact that iTunes is fairly small in the scheme of things (it is smaller than an OS update, or an iPhone/iPad firmware).\n\nA: \nI use iTunes on my mac (OS X 10.6) but\n  I wonder what's up with it's update. I\n  realy want know Why Itunes updates get\n  released so fast and why everytime the\n  entire Itunes has to be updated\n  instead of patched.\n\nIt probably is patched. There are more then a few files that go along with iTunes, there are other applications and shared processes that must be updated as well.\nApplications are updated on an as-needed basis. You probably don't have to update right this minute, it's simply saying an update is available, and you would be better off if you updated. This could fix any number of issues, from performance, stability, or misc \"bugs\" that were found. You can see the (abbreviated) changelog if you want to know exactly what this update is supposed to do.\nContrary to the other answer, it is not how Apple \"bundles\" applications. The \"bundle\" is simply a folder that finder interprets as an application. Applications can (and are often) \"patched\" by modifying files withing these .app folders. The entire application does not need to be replaced every time. Otherwise every Adobe update would take days do download. \n\nA: Please note that the following answer is valid for any application (Apple-specific or 3rd party).\nIt's the way Apple bundles all applications. In fact every *.app is a bundle (think - folder).  You can open it in finder (right click -> Show Package Contents) or cd to it in terminal. That's why any app is not patched like on windows systems where files of one program is scattered all over the file system, but sort of \"replaced\" as a whole.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/225", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: iPad displays \"Not Charging\" when plugged into USB ports.  What can I do? When I plug my iPad into my computer's USB ports, the iPad battery area displays \"Not Charging\".  \nI understand the iPad requires more wattage to charge compared to an iPhone or iPod, as evidenced by the iPad's larger power adapter (10W) vs the iPhone's (5W).\nIs there anything I can do to enable iPad charging from my computer's USB ports? The computer in question is a desktop PC, and it has a 950W power supply.  I presume the motherboard's own USB ports are the issue, as opposed to overall power available :-)\nSo I'd like to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there external USB hubs that can supply enough power to charge the iPad?\n\n*Is there any other solution to enable a computer's USB ports to charge an iPad?\ne.g. doubling up a USB port, as I've seen done with some external hard drive enclosures?\n\nA: From the article, The iPad's USB charging caveat:\n[Originally posted on Neowin.net by giga on 04 April 2010 12:26]\n\nThe iPad specifications page clearly state the ability to charge with USB (with no mention of OS requirements) but Apple have additionally provided a support document disclosing that \"some USB 2.0 ports and accessories do not provide enough power to charge iPad.\"\nProviding some further clarification to Macworld, Apple asserts that USB charging is supported but that it varies according to the state of the iPad and the power output of the USB hub:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*For the fastest charging, use the iPad\u2019s included 10-Watt USB power adapter. This will fully charge the iPad in a few hours, even if you\u2019re using the iPad at the same time.\n  \n*When connected to a high-power USB port\u2014such as the ones on recent Macs and the iPhone Power Adapter\u2014the iPad will charge, even during use, but more slowly. (We haven\u2019t yet determined how much more slowly.) Some third-party powered USB hubs provide higher-power USB ports, but many don\u2019t; similarly, the USB ports on most Windows PCs don\u2019t provide this additional power.\n  \n*When connected to lower-power USB ports\u2014those on older Macs, most Windows PCs, and most USB hubs (powered or unpowered)\u2014the iPad\u2019s battery is not charged while the iPad is awake, but is charged (again, slowly) when the iPad is asleep. What\u2019s confusing here is that the message \"Not charging\" appears in the menu bar when the iPad is awake, which might lead you to assume that the offending USB port can never charge  your iPad. But rest assured, Apple says: once you put the iPad to sleep, the battery will indeed charge. (If you could see the screen while the iPad was asleep, it might even display the charging icon. It\u2019s the modern-day \u201cDoes the refrigerator light stay on when I close the door?\u201d mystery.)\n  \n  \n  Further analysis from Apple's statements indicate that the iPad can only be charged off of USB connections that provide near 1 amp of current. The majority of USB ports on most older Macs and PCs only provide 500 mA and thus can't be used to charge the device. \nThe USB 2.0 specification provides 500 mA of current to high-powered buses and 100 mA for low-powered buses. But in April 2009, the specification gained a new \"Battery Charging Specification\" which provided additional current to high power devices and it seems that Apple has started to incorporate it in their newer Macs.\n\n\nA: As Am1rr3zA mentioned above, the specs for USB 2.0 provides for 500 mA of power. Apple is the sole manufacturer that I know of that utilizes higher-than-spec powered USB ports, and I think, even then that's only on their later model (within the last couple years) Macs.\n\"Not charging\" is a bit of a misnomer, because in fact, the iPad is charging, but it's also draining power. It says \"Not charging\" when it's draining power quicker than it's charging, which is the case when plugged into 500 mA USB ports. There's nothing you can really do about this, unfortunately.\n\nA: The same thing happened to me  \"Not Charging\" but when I inserted my motherboard support cd i saw a software called \"ASUS Ai Charger\" then i installed it and restarted. Then when i plugged in my iPad mini it charged \n\nA: Check if there is an update for your motherboard, many manufacturer has release update to enable USB port to deliver enough watt to charge an iPad.\n\nA: This is one of many cases in which a device that says it's not charging is actually... charging... very... slowly.\nThis is the case with the ipad here, ipods and iphones that are put into older docks, blackberries that are connected to older macbooks, etc.\nYou'll likely be just fine if you charge it overnight, but if you're waiting for it, it's pretty darn slow.\n\nA: USB 3.0 is specified for up to 900 mA.  Give such a hub a try.\n\nA: I installed \"ASUS IA Chrager\" on my PC and it worked\nASUS AI Charger\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/274", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "20"}}

{"text": "Q: Can I use Time Machine to back up data to a Windows shared drive? How can I do \"Time Machine\" from my Mac OS X 10.6.4 to my Window share drive? I'd also prefer to encrypt my image, so it's \"safe\" just in case :-)\n\nA: In order to create a Time Machine backup to an unsupported drive (pretty much anything that's not formatted HFS+) you need to run the following Terminal command:\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\n\nYour share will now show up as a valid Time Machine destination in the Time Machine Preference Pane.\nTime Machine will then create a disk image on that drive that will act just like a HFS+ drive for Time Machines purposes (hard linking, etc.). One advantage of using a disk image over using the entire drive is that you can limit the size it will grow to of the disk image using Disk Utility.\nBe sure to check Louis Gerbarg's answer as well for why it's unsupported and you have to jump through a hoop to enable it.\n\nA: There are various hacks to setup a diskimage on the share, which I am sure other people will describe in depth. Having said that DO NOT USE SMB TO STORE TIME MACHINE BACKUPS.\nGuaranteeing writes on a disk image backed over a network store is complicated. Apple had reliability issues with Time Machine over AFP for years, and they controlled the entire stack. In order to guarantee write ordering and write stability (which are necessary in order for Time Machine to work in the presence of intermittent networking, such as walking out or range of the base station or putting the machine to sleep midbackup and waking it up out of range) Time Machine depends on features specific to AFP (For those interested, those are published as part of the Time Machine Network Server Requirements).\nIf you want to backup to a Windows Machine you should probably get a copy of ExtremeZ-IP, if it is a linux box running SAMBA you should install netatalk.\n\nA: I did not test this solution, but looks someone did a little write up for this:\nOSX Timemachine and Samba/Windows share \u00ab Hupio\u2019s Weblog\n\nA: Yes with caveats\n\n*\n\n*Create a sparsebundle disk image per these instructions Windows NTFS Linux or other disk for Time Machine Backups and move it to your network file share\n\n*Optional: Add the disk image as a login item so that it is mounted when you log-in\n\n*\n\n* Menu -> System Preferences -> Users and Groups -> Login Items -> '+' button -> Navigate to the network drive and select the sparsebundle\n\n*Or, add a cron job for a 2 line script:\n\n*\n\n*osascript -e 'mount volume \"smb://username@servername/sharename\"'\n\n*hdiutil attach /Volumes/servernameandorsharename \n(The advantage of osascript over bash is that osascript will remember your password)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*If your disk doesn't appear as an option in Time Machine preferences use the line from Chealion's answer: defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1.\n\n*\n\n*And/Or use the commandline: tmutil setdestination /Volumes/Volumenameonceitsbeenmounted\n\n\n\n\n*Buy a copy of Alsoft DiskWarrior.\n\nThe problem is, as @louis-gerbarg says, backup to a network share is a risk unless your server, router, network and client are all very reliable. The symptom is then that the disk no longer mounts and your backup no longer runs.\n\nI have been doing Time Machine backup to network share for 10 years and I reckon on a disk repair every other month. I have sometimes got through a year with Disk Utility or chkdsk alone repairing errors but that left me with a trail of old broken backup images.\n\nThat said, the better perspective is:\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have 3 copies, you aren't serious about backup. Therefore:\n\n*You should also have everything duplicated to somewhere that's at least fire-and-theft-isolated from your machine. Some combination of iDrive, OneDrive, Github, Syncthing, Cubbit, diy Azure storage, for instance.\n\n*That leaves me still using TimeMachine primarily for the convenience of recent versions: 'darn get me the version from yesterday'. It's a great interface. So now I'm less concerned about losing last year's TM backups so long as I can start a new TM backup tonight.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, I don't believe you can. From the Time Machine help docs:\nTime Machine can\u2019t back up to an external disk connected to an AirPort Extreme, or to an iPod, iDisk, or disk formatted for Windows.\nEDIT: Ignore this answer.

{"text": "Q: How can you get Finder to sort by name, but also sort folders before files? When I want sort my files and folder in Finder (specially sort by name) they sort all item by name mixing folders and files together. I want a way that sorts (like Windows) first all folders by name then all other items by name. How can I do this?\n\nA: There's no built in feature in the Finder to achieve that, but with the \"plugin\" TotalFinder you can get that. It's located under the \"Tweaks\" tab in the TotalFinder settings.\nEdit: There was a screenshot here, but it was out of date. Look at Robsofts answer instead for an up-to-date screenshot!\n\nA: XtraFinder is free plugin for Finder that allows you to sort folders before files, by selecting \"Arrange folders on top\" in the Preferences.\nAfter installing and running it, you can tune folder sorting and many other aspects of Finder behavior.\n\nA: Here is a method that involves a plist setting, and no plugin, or third party app.\nTo summarize:\n\nShow Package Contents of Finder.app (located in System/Library/CoreServices\nDrill down to Contents > Resources > English.lproj. > InfoPlist.strings\nLocate the string \u201cFolder\u201d = \u201cFolder\u201d;\nAdd a leading space before the second Folder as follows: \u201cFolder\u201d = \u201c Folder\u201d;\nSave InfoPlist.strings to the same location (backup elsewhere if desired)\nRelaunch Finder (Ctrl+Option+Click)\nOpen new Finder window and sort files by Kind\n\n\nA: Related to the Total Finder answer above (so please don't vote for this answer), here's a picture of the current TF tweaks page (you get to it from the Finder's Preferences screen). With these options I definitely get the folders at the top of the list.\nYou can also control this from the VIEW menu in Finder, once TF is installed.\n\n\nA: There is a Finder replacement called Path Finder that will do what you want. It's a bit more expensive but it does do a lot more than just a regular finder window.\n\nA: As of OS X Yosemite (\u2265 10.10), you can sort folders above files without any third-party apps.\nFinder > Preferences -> Advanced tab -> Check \"Keep folders on top: in windows when sorting by name\" option.\n\nA: This is possible by having icons displayed as list (Cmd + 2) in Finder window. First click on the [Name] column header (this will sort all files by name), then click on [Kind] column header (this will sort items by kind, but keep the name sorting in groups).\n\nA: Since I have found myself doing the Folder trick over and over again I ended up creating a bash script to automate renaming of the string in /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/InfoPlist.strings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Save it as e.g. finder-folders-first.sh\n\n*Make it executable: chmod +x finder-folders-first.sh\n\n*Run with root permissions: sudo finder-folders-first.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n# Make folders sortable first in Finder\n\nif [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then\n   echo \"Script must be run as root!

Is there a tool or application that will securely wipe an iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad (i.e. any iOS device?)\nI'm not interested in a complete wipe that would brick the device.  Rather, I'd want to wipe all free space after it's been reset to default or had the OS reinstalled.\nFurthermore: by \"securely wipe\", I'm referring to multiple successive passes with random data, etc. to thwart any attempt at data recovery.\nFor instance: If somebody wanted to sell their old iPhone on eBay, how can they be sure it's completely wiped, so there's little hope of a malicious buyer being able to recover sensitive data that used to be on it?\nI think this is especially important when people are using iPhone apps to store passwords, credit card numbers, etc. (even if those apps have a supposedly secure storage mechanism.)\n\nA: The built in secure-wipe does a very good job, but you should really create a new user on your Mac and do a Restore from iTunes while logged in as that user, and then do the secure wipe mentioned by Studer.

If you upgrade from 3.0 you need to do a restore to set the stage for hardware encryption of all the data.\nIf your device isn't capable of hardware encryption (often called secure data at rest), then you can use the Erase all content and settings function.

Making a new account on your Mac or PC is an easy way to have a library with no account, no songs, and no apps just to be sure the device has a clean (and easily verifiable) start to it's new life.\n\nA: One option would be to put it into disk mode and then use an external utility to do the wiping. \n\nA: You can get ShredIt for iOS, more information can be found here: http://www.burningthumb.com/apps/shredit/\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/326", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "17"}}

I have an iMac and MacBook Pro both running Mountain Lion, and the iMac now serves my xbox, wdtv live and archos 7 faultlessly. This may sound set up but save yourself the pain and effort and try Plex first.\nPlex takes a while to run through a big, say 3tb collection but it genuinely has been the most painless and reliable of all I've tried and the searchable options are far more varied and sensible than those for others. Don't want to name names but I've pretty much tried them all. The only thing I can't comment on is transcoding; I assume their clients manage this. From my perspective, I needed something to access my library, rather than rely on hardware specific transcoding.

I do enjoy the artwork that Plex brings up for certain titles.\nPlayback didn't try to re-order or rename anything. It just reflected exactly what the folder contents were in alphabetical order.

Frequently when I'm using Safari on the iPad and loading multiple web sites at the same time and switching between them, Safari starts to reload a page when I switch back to it, even if it's been only a few minutes since I last opened the page.  This can be quite annoying.\nIs there any way to control how often Safari on the iPad will perform refresh a page?  Ideally, I'd like to tell Safari to not refresh any pages and just refresh manually when I want to.\n\nA: Safari (for iPod and iPad) keeps website cache only in RAM, and therefore, once it runs out of RAM, it'll automatically destroy an entire page, forcing the refresh, disguising itself as an auto-refresh feature. You can only keep few pages respective to amount of your device RAM.\nYou can try a third-party browser that has offline caching, and it'll remedy the situation. like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mercury\n\n*iCab\n\n*Atomic Web Browser\nor if you Limit the number of tabs open in Safari to 2 or 3.

Not exactly very suitable answers until iOS 4.1 is eventually released for the iPad. Alternative browsers such as iCab have an offline bookmark option that will save the entire page to disk so you can view it without needing to refresh until you want to.\nSafari on iOS has a very limited size on it's cache and will refresh a page when you come back to it if the cache is full. Part of this is because of the limited RAM available on iOS devices along with the fact that Apple doesn't write any cached items to the flash memory and only keeps it in the memory. (The iPad and iPhone 3G S only have ~256 MB of RAM, earlier devices 128 MB and the iPhone 4 512 MB)\nYahoo has run a series of tests to determine just how large the cache is. If the HTML of a page exceeds 25.6KB it will not be cached (and so refreshed every time you visit), external components can be larger (Up to 4MB) but the max size of the HTML page cache is only ~280KB on an iPad (paltry really). iOS 4 is set to increase that page cache size up to as much RAM as is available.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/350", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

{"text": "Q: Why does OS X's Apache server give different results using real and virtual addresses? I'm developing a WordPress site on my Mac, running OS X 10.6.4. I'm using OS X's built-in Apache server to run the site locally during development. I've set up WordPress and connected it to OS X's MySQL with no problems. The site seems to work fine, and I can post, edit, etc.\nThe WordPress installation is in a folder called ~/Sites/mysite.dev.\nI've also customized my .hosts file and Apache's httpd-vhosts.conf file, to redirect requests for mysite.dev to this folder. So when I enter http://mysite.dev in a browser window, the site loads. No problems here.\nSo I can access the site, in a browser, from two different addresses, http://mysite.dev, and http://localhost/~Gabe/mysite.dev/.\nHere's what's weird: When I go to http://mysite.dev, the WordPress site loads normally. When I go to http://localhost/~Gabe/mysite.dev/, WordPress can't find any posts from the database: It gives me the \"Sorry, no posts met your criteria\" message (which is built into the theme for when a search for posts returns nothing). N.B.: Apache processes the PHP code normally in both cases -- but in one case WordPress can get posts from MySQL, and in the other case it can't.\nMy first thought was that this was a problem with WordPress's configuration, so I changed the WordPress URL to http://localhost/~Gabe/mysite.dev/, but this made no difference. \nI don't understand why using the two addresses produces different results.

A redirect doesn't change any PHP code behavior and since you apparently get response from the code, nothing is wrong with the server setup.

{"text": "Q: Multiple tags on music in iTunes? Is there any plugin for iTunes making it possible to tag the music with multiple tags (not ID3-tags or genre)? Just like last.fm does, e.g. \"soft electronic african female-vocalist\"?  Genres are so totally unusable to use as a music categorizer.\nI use iTunes a lot for syncing various iDevices and streaming music to the Airport Express, so I'm not really interested in an alternative app, even though I might be if it supports more or less everything iTunes does and have some more features, but also being compatible with and updating the iTunes library.\nA big bonus would be if it's also allowing hierarchical tag structures.\n\nA: While it won't satisfy the hierarchical feature you'd like, the Grouping (or even the Comment) field in iTunes could be used to hold tags.

(Grouping contains).\nThere is an unfinished program called QuickTag that leverages that ability and makes it easier to tag.\nThere is also a hint on MacOSXHints.com that shows how you can grab Last.FM's tags and apply them to the current playing track. You'll need to modify their script slightly - namely to use the grouping or comment field (and match anything special you've done, eg. <>s around the word) instead of the genre.

{"text": "Q: Prevent iTunes from resetting my music library location My iTunes library is located on an network drive, or rather, the music is, and my library file is located on my MacBook.\n\n\n*\n\n*Library file: /Users/glenn/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library\n\n*Music: /Volumes/MyVolume/Music\nBut every now and then when I use the laptop somewhere outside my WiFi network, and then come back, fire up iTunes and play a song  I get a library full of those pesky little exclamation point icons next to my songs. This is because iTunes have guessed that \"Oh, he's not at home, let's reset the music files location to /Users/glenn/Music/iTunes.\" And there are no music there.\nHow can I prevent iTunes from doing this \"smart\" guess, and just leave the setting alone?\nPS. And MyVolume is auto-mounted on my laptop. But of course, if iTunes is running when opening up the lid of the MacBook, it takes some time for it to mount, and iTunes won't find the path to the music at first.\n\nA: You can make \"iTunes Music\" an alias to your music folder on your network drive. That should keep iTunes' smartness at bay.\n\nA: Finally figured out how to get around this myself. My solution is to have two separate libraries, one local and one on my drive. I created a LaunchAgent (see https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html) that runs a script when the mount path to the disk changes (via WatchPaths). The script checks whether the directory /Volumes/drivename exists, and if it does it sets runs a command to tell iTunes to change to the Library on the drive.\nif [ -e \"$mountPath\" ]\nthen\n   defaults write com.apple.iTunes 'alis:1:iTunes Library Location' -data \"drive hex path data\"\nelse\n   defaults write com.apple.iTunes 'alis:1:iTunes Library Location' -data \"local hex path data\"\nfi\n\nOtherwise it runs the same command with the path to the local library.\nMac OS does some weird kind of encoding for the hex data path, so I would recommend holding down the option key while starting iTunes, selecting each library, and examine the plist for the path data (note that when you use the defaults command you have to remove the brackets and spaces from the hex data).\nThis way, if your drive isn't mounted, iTunes will load a local library and won't mess up your main one. This can be handy for traveling, etc when you just want to use the local library to play stuff on iCloud.\n\nA: Apparently this is a never-ending issue, because by this date I\u2019m running OS 10.13.6 on a 2012 Mac Mini, and I needed Winger\u2019s Answer to figure out a solution for me: not up to coding in the system files. But I DID realize (as he suggested) that if I removed iTunes from the \u2018Login Items\u2019 automatic startup list in the Users system Prefs pane, and let the Mac connect to the network drive first (which is an ethernet connected TimeCapsule, which I\u2019m using also for it\u2019s storage volume as extra space, and IS in the Login Items pane), that when iTunes is opened it finds its library right where it left it! Happy iTunes, happy me!\n\nA: What works for me is a combination of the above ... add the shared folder location to:\nsystem preferences -> users & groups -> login items (in the login name you're using)\nThis establishes the network connection automatically upon restart which appears to be the root cause of this.\nThen untick the \"reopen windows when logging back in\" option when restarting. When the mac next restarts and you log in, the shared folder will automatically be opened (it opens in finder, but you can close it).\nWhen you open apple music, it remembers what it was set to and you no longer need to reset the location and rescan your files each time.\nI worked this one out because when apple music is opened before the network drive, the music file location reverts back to the default location. But if you close apple music, open the network drive where your music is stored, then re-open apple music it magically reverts back to what you had it set to.\nBut if you re-enable the \"reopen windows when logging back in\" option, it seems that apple music gets launched before the shared folder - so you're back where you started. Although if you typically have a lot of windows open, you could just close and re-open apple music after restarting which should work.\n\nA: Just a thought for your laptop, why don't you share your iTunes library and stream it to your laptop instead of mounting the network drive?\nI'm in the process of setting this up now, I just moved my iTunes library and media files to my Network Attached Storage, which can share with all machines on my home network.\nI was having the same library reset issue as you, so I'll try using an alias in Windows 7 to get around this (thanks @zneak). Nothing scarier than telling iTunes where my 10,000+ song library is and have it show nothing :(\n\nA: I would guess that when the iTunes media directory /Volumes/MyVolume/Music is found to not exist, it resets to the default value of /Users/glenn/Music/iTunes. That is to say, I don't think it matters if the files are there or not (so network mounting is not so much the issue), but that the directory is there and can be browsed.\nSo a solution would be to have an empty directory as your iTunes media library directory (which can just be the default), and mount the network share into that directory. This would involve using smbmount rather than the standard Finder-based /Volumes/... mounting. Of course... smbmount doesn't come with OS X, so this solution will require some effort on your part to get smbmount.\nYou might be able to achieve the same with symbolic links, though I'm not sure whether iTunes can handle its media library directory being a broken symlink; it might just delete the symlink by forcibly creating the /Users/glenn/Music/iTunes directory on top of it...?\n\nA: The \"music location\" path only matters if you set itunes to \"import media into your local library\" and with \"automatic library management\" activated. With both options disabled, its not of importance. You set the options in the same tab where you set the \"music location\" path.\nRemember: If you use links or aliases to non existing places (when youre not at your network) you might get into trouble with itunes trying to write stuff there - it might even reset because of this.\nIf you add files from a network, with local management off, the network path will be stored inside your library file, no matter what is set as music location. If you are not on your network you will always see the exclamation mark as the files aren't accessible, it makes totally sense. Exclamation mark goes away as soon your network is at reach again.\nI have everything stored on my network, nothing locally and do not have any trouble.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/364", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "12"}}

What worked for me was to map Cmd to Shift.\n\nAll the other shortcuts such as Cmd + S (save), Cmd + C (copy), etc still worked but hitting Cmd by itself now just activates the Shift key which really does nothing by itself.\n\nA: Go to Parallels Desktop preferences and disable key mapping for key which behaves abnormally (\"Cmd > win\" in our case) as shown on the screenshot below:\n\n\nA: You can use Krumstick to remap the windows key inside Windows.\n\nA: Not sure if this will help you. But the main problem for me was the CMD + arrow keys I use all the time to go to the start or end of a line. \nThis can be remapped without problems, this way you can use all your normal shortcuts from MacOS too. The second I get a Mac keyboard muscle memory kicks in and this is a good compromise :)\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/374", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}
{"text": "Q: Can Macs be put in hibernation voluntarily? I know that when you put your Mac laptop to sleep and the battery dies, next time you plug it in it will wake up from the state it was prior to being put to sleep. There are also hacks to get this behavior with a desktop Mac (except it triggers when you put the Mac to sleep and unplug it).\nIs there a way to trigger this behavior without cutting power, and that will still let me put my Mac to sleep normally? Like Windows 7's Hibernate option.\n\nA: Yes, of course you can. I myself use Deep Sleep widget (second link) to put my Macbook Pro into hibernation.\nAnd if you prefer to use the command line, read this article.\n\n\nA: There is a pref pane called smart sleep that is pretty good\n\nA: You could use DeepSleep.\nI know this is a widget, but if you want an application, do the following :\n\n*\n\n*Download the widget and uncompress the zip file containing it, but do not install it.\n\n\n*Right-click on the widget, the select Show Package Contents.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Copy the DeepSleep Application where you want.\n\n\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/377", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "18"}}
{"text": "Q: Keyboard shortcuts for \"Straighten\" in iPhoto? If you've used iPhoto for photo retouching, you probably know the Straighten functionality. \n\nMy question is, are there any keyboard shortcuts for rotating the photo, or is mouse & the slider the only way? Any other useful tips regarding this are of course also welcome.\nIt can be somewhat slow and awkward to do this with mouse/trackpad for each photo (especially if your mouse is not the most accurate one, like my Logitech bluetooth mouse). In iPhoto '09 they made matters worse by removing the small buttons next to the slider that you could click to rotate by one step (0.1 degrees).\n\nA: You can press the S key to activate the straighten tool. And the return key will save any changes. Unfortunately, I am not sure how to control the slider in order to actually make a change using the keyboard.\n\nA: If you have a trackpad you can use two-finger-rotation gestures in Straighten mode. See http://www.cnet.com/news/quick-tip-iphoto-11-trackpad-gestures/\n\nA: You can use the Accessibility Inspector to input arbitrary numbers for the amount of rotation. See this post here for usage instructions.\nRemember to press Set value to change the number and input numbers with decimal point, e.g. 4.0.\n\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/384", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}
{"text": "Q: Can I transfer backups when replacing a Time Capsule? If I get a new Time Capsule, how can I transfer the backups from the old Time Capsule to the new one. I see an option to Archive the Time Capsule from the Airport Utility, but I don't see any way to restore. Do I have to go through the initial back up process again with all of my Macs?\n\nA: From Apple Support Knowledge Base...\nTime Capsule, Mac OS X v10.6.3 or later: How to transfer your back up from an existing Time Capsule to a new one\nFor this process, you should leave your computer in the same room as the Time Capsules, or use one Ethernet cable to connect your Mac to the Ethernet port on the existing Time Capsule, then use another Ethernet cable to connect from the existing Time Capsule to the new Time Capsule.\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure your Time Capsule for your network. See the documentation\nthat came with your Time Capsule for information about setting it up\non your network. \n\n*Open Time Machine preferences in System\nPreferences.\n\n*Slide the Time Machine switch to Off. \n\n*Open a Finder\nwindow. \n\n*Locate both Time Capsules listed in the SHARED section of\nthe navigation pane on the left of the Finder window.  Note: If you\ndo not see your Time Capsules in that section, choose Preferences\nfrom the Finder menu and make sure \"Connected servers\" is checked\nunder SHARED. \n\n*Select the name of the new Time Capsule in the\nnavigation pane. The default name is \"Time Capsule xxxxxx\", with\nxxxxxx being the last digits of the ID printed on the bottom of the\nTime Capsule. \n\n*Mount the volume by double-clicking the name of the\nvolume in the Finder window's main section. The default drive name\nis \"Data\". \n\n*Open a new Finder window by pressing Command-N, or by\nchoosing File > New Finder Window. \n\n*Repeat the previous 2 steps with\nthe other Time Capsule, to mount it. Drag your backup disk image\nfrom the current Time Capsule to the new Time Capsule. This can take\nsome time to complete because your entire backup will be copied.\n\n*Open Time Machine preferences in System Preferences. \n\n*Click \"Select\nDisk...\", then select your new Time Capsule. \n\n*Perform a Time Machine\nback up. \n\n*After the back up, you can remove the Ethernet cables if\ndesired and configure your wireless network to your liking.\n\n\nA: This is a slow way but dead simple. After letting the new time capsule absorb the setting from the old one and hooking it up to your network then just reconnect with Airport Utility to the old one. Reconfigure the old one to extend your network instead of making a new one. \nNow you can mount both drives and copy files between then as you wish.\n\nA: Some time ago I read an article about this procedure but it's a bit of a hack.\nI won't copy it here because it's a 12-point tutorial.\nAnyway, I was too lazy to test it, so I cannot guaranty it will work.\nMaybe someone will post a better solution.\n\nA: If you can find a way to hook up the TImeCapsule's drive to your mac directly you might get away with this simple Disk Utility trick:\nhttp://rolfje.com/2008/09/07/a-bigger-timemachine-without-changing-history/\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/385", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I get files on my iPad into my Dropbox? Let's say I get a file in an email, or have it stored in GoodReader, or find a link to it on the web, and want to put it into my Dropbox using the ipad app. \nIt seems like the only files you can add from the app are photos and video.  Am I missing anything?  Goodreader is a great example of how an app can \"pull in\" compatible files from emails, etc, but I can't find any similar capability in the Dropbox app.\n\nA: You can use Habilis to email files to Dropbox. I use it to transfer photos from my phone to my iPad without needing the camera connection kit. It works like a charm.\nIf you have a Mac, you can also use MobileDL to get files into Dropbox. It's an app that allows you to paste a URL into Simplenote on your iPad/iPhone/iPod and it'll start downloading the file on your Mac. Just make sure to go into the preferences when you install it and set the downloads folder to your Dropbox. The downside, of course, is that you'll have to leave your Mac on at home so you can use it.\n\nA: This is actually possible to do without any extra applications now. With attachments that can be previewed in Mail, and most every file type in Safari, you can use the Open in... and choose Dropbox. You then get to choose a folder to upload the file to and tap the Upload button.\nIn Mail, do this:\n\nAnd in Safari, do this:\n\n\nA: I've been wanting to do this too, but thus far to no avail. From the Dropbox in-app help, it states, 'The iPad version of the Dropbox Mobile Application allows you to upload any videos or photos synced to your gallery.'\nSo, from that I'd assume that you're not missing anything - your only upload options at the moment are photos and video from the general gallery. :-(\nIt'll be interesting to see if people post any usable workarounds, of course. :-)\n\nA: Here's a nice solution: http://sendtodropbox.com\nAnd here's how I found it. Thanks votebox!\n\nA: I believe that whilst this capability is not included in the official dropbox app, it is possible to accomplish using GoodReader for iPad.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open GoodReader on iPad and expand the section in the bottom right of the main screen which says \"Connect to Servers\"\n\n*Tap \"Add\"\n\n*Tap \"Dropbox\"\n\n*Enter your details and click add\n\n*Now tap the server you just added (I called it \"Dropbox\")\n\n*In the bottom right hand corner of the popover that just came up is a button saying upload. Tap it.\n\n*Select the files you want to upload and tap \"Upload\"\n\n\nYou will only need to do steps 5-7 the second time\n\nA: Regarding that link on the Web, icabmobile: http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/icab-mobile-web-browser/id308111628?mt=8 can download files and upload to dropbox. \n\nA: if you have goodreader, you can add your dropbox account to it, no more need fore the dropbox app.\n\nA: Jailbreak your device and install iFile from Cydia.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/395", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "15"}}

I changed it from the default to Ctrl+` as the default merely adjusted brightness.\n\n\nA: If you connect two Mac's directly using a standard ethernet cable, you can quickly transfer files between them.  It automatically configures the connection, and is much faster than doing large transfers over wireless.\n\nA: When resizing columns in Finder, hold down \u2325 whilst dragging, and you'll resize all columns and reset the default width.\n\nA: In order to navigate with the keyboard in the menu bar, press ctrl+F2. The Apple icon in the menu bar will light up, and you can navigate through the menus using arrows and the \u21a9 key.\nOnce you are in the menu bar you can also navigate using initial letters, e.g. b to go to Bookmarks\n\nA: Ever wanted to stop the iTunes visualizer at that really cool moment and take a picture? In iTunes 10 (and previous versions really) you can control what your visualizer is doing. You need to have a song playing to notice changes. \nSimply press the ? key to see a help menu of the controls. On most visualizers press f to see the current FPS. (all except the default)\nTo freeze the default iTunes visualizer press F to freeze the mode, then press L to freeze the camera. Now that your visualizer is completely stopped, press M to change the mode. Turn the fog on and off with N (only works with certain themes). Change the color palette with P before freezing the mode or locking the camera or it has no effect. \u2318 + F  for full screen, then \u2318+\u21e7+3 for full screen grab.\nViola, instant custom desktop pattern! \n\nA: Holding \u2318 lets you drag icons in your menu bar to reorder them. Dragging them out of the menu bar removes them.\nAll of the built-in icons support this behavior, but most third-party apps don't.\n\nA: 3rd party apps can add unwanted items to your right click menus!  To add or remove items from the right click contextual menus:\nGo to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts. Select the \"Services\" panel and uncheck the services which you don't need. \n\nA: When switching focus between applications, you can hold down \u2325 and click on another application. When you change focus from one application to another, the first application hides. So, let's say you are switching from an open Finder window to an open TextEdit window while holding the \u2325 key. Finder will hide once you click on the TextEdit window. I discovered this by accident and it's pretty cool\n\nA: In iTunes, it\u2019s possible to make \u2318 + F focus the search input instead of toggling the full screen mode.\nSimply enter this command in Terminal.app:\ndefaults write com.apple.iTunes NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"Target Search Field\" \"@F\"\n\nThen, restart iTunes.\nDisclaimer: This is just one of the many goodies in my .osx file.\n\nA: To paste plain text without any formatting use \u21e7+\u2325+\u2318+V.\nThat's very useful when working in app like Keynote and copying some text from webpage. \nNote: It doesn't work if any other function assigned to this shortcut. To fix that just change the default shortcut in the app to something else. \n\nA: When you drag and drop any file (or folder) from Finder onto a Terminal window, it gets converted into the full (absolute) path to that file.\nI find this a small but occasionally useful trick when dealing with files in both Finder and Terminal.\n\nA: Hold ctrl and move the scroll wheel (or use two fingers on trackpad). It will zoom in the entire screen.\nThis setting can be enabled or changed in the System Preferences, under Acessibility, Zoom.\n\nA: Hibernate your MacBook Pro with\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25\nand then put it to sleep which will save the state of your system and then power off. Very handy when flying.\nIf instead you want very fast sleeps, without writing memory to disk, use\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\nTo restore the default behaviour, use\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3\n\nA: Quickly find your search results in Safari \n\n\n*\n\n*Perform a Google search in the toolbar \n\n*Click a result \n\n*Press \u2318+G\nvia @Mactip\n\nA: Remember the double-sided arrows on both the top and bottom of the scroll column in OS 9?

Useful for quick transfers, large transfers (it's quite fast), recovery, etc.\nTo start it, hold T during startup.\n\nA:  sudo purge\n\nI use this all the time for freeing unused memory on my Mac.\n\nA: El Capitan has a new split full screen feature, where you can have two apps open at once. I use it all the time, but the one thing I find inconvenient about is that it will very strongly blur the un-focused window when resizing a pane:\n\nYou can hold down \u2325 while resizing to see both screens respond to your resize changes -- neither will be blurred.\n\nA: When I migrated from Windows to Mac OS X, what I really missed is the ability to move files with cut (Ctrl + X) and paste (Ctrl + V) (as opposed to copy and paste).\nIt turns out Finder has this capability as well, but it's more like 'mark and move': Cmd + C and then Alt + Cmd + V.\n\nA: Since El Capitan (OS X 10.10), the green button in the top left of a window does not resize the window as it used to, but instead turns it into full-screen mode.\nTo get the old behavior back, hold down the \u2325 key, which will turn the green button's symbol from the resizer to a + as it used to be.\n\nA: macOS has a built-in option to mass rename files (including changing the extension), which I found here while looking for a shell script snippet to do the trick.

Just add \n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<true/>\n\n\nA: Probably the most used shortcut I created on my machine is one to hide and show hidden files.\nI've set this up via an AppleScript on my machine with a keyboard shortcut of ^ + \u2318 + \u21e7 + . which toggles the visibility of hidden files within Finder whenever I want.  This way I don't have to manually run a terminal command to show hidden files, and I can quickly turn it off to avoid accidentally modifying system files. I use FastScripts to allow me to set the keyboard shortcut for my AppleScript, and placed the AppleScript in my ~/Library/Scripts Folder.\nHere is the AppleScript in case you wish to give it a try:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    set hiddenFilesDisplayStatus to do shell script \"defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles\"\n    set hiddenFilesNewDisplayStatus to \"NO\"\n\n    if hiddenFilesDisplayStatus is \"NO\" then\n        set hiddenFilesNewDisplayStatus to \"YES\"\n    end if\n\n    do shell script \"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles \" & hiddenFilesNewDisplayStatus\n    do shell script \"killall Finder\"\n\nend tell\n\n\nA: The Guest account is great for troubleshooting.\nIf I have a software issue, logging in as Guest lets me open an app with 'clean' preferences settings.  \nIt's helped me with network issues as well.  \nTo enable Guest logins, go to System Preferences, Users & Groups, Guest User, and check Allow guests to log in to this computer.  \n\nA: I really find the inbuilt dictionary useful on Cocoa apps like Safari and Mail etc.\nWith your cursor over a word, press ctrl+\u2318+D to get a definition.\nYou can also drag a word straight onto the Safari icon in the Dock to perform a Google search for the word.\n\nA: Holding down \u21e7 while using the mouse scroll wheel will scroll the window horizontally.\n\nA: Most animations in macOS can be played in slow motion, when you hold \n\u21e7(Shift). Works for example to slowly minimize windows if you click the minimize button while holding the \n\u21e7(Shift) key.\nOther examples are:\n\n*\n\n*toggle expos\u00e9\n\n*toggle dashboard\n\n*add/remove dashboard items\n\n*all kinds of animations in Twitter for Mac\n\nFrom: http://www.eeggs.com/items/29318.html\n\nIn macOS, while in the finder, open any window & click the minimizie button (yellow) at the top of the window while holding shift.\nThis will minimize the window in slow motion using the new \"genie effect\" minimize function of macOS.\nThe CEO of Apple has shown this egg publicly several times. However, this egg is undocumented & has no system menu equivalent to use this feature. Anyone who has NOT followed the development of macOS & watched the demos at the MacWorld trade shows would not realize this somewhat useless feature exists in macOS.\n\n\nA: In any Finder window or Open/Save dialog, you can hit \u2318\u21e7G (just '/' also works in Open/Save) to get a location bar from which you can directly type in the directory to go to. It even supports ~ for home and tab completion.\nThe Open/Save dialog has several other useful shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*\u2318 R -\nReveals the selected item in a new\nFinder window.\n\n*\u2318 I - Info window shows for the selected item.\n\n*\u2318 \u21e7 > - Shows/Hides hidden files in the dialog\n\n*\u2318 F - cursor jumps to the Find text field\n\n*/ or ~ - Opens a Go To Folder dialogue. \n\n*\u2318 D or \u2318 \u21e7 D - selects the ~/Desktop folder as a destination\n\n*\u2318 \u2325 L - selects ~/Downloads folder as a destination\n\n*\u2318 \u21e7 O - selects ~/Documents folder as a destination\n\n*\u2318 \u2325 S - Shows/Hides sidebar\n\n*\u2318 . or esc - Cancels and closes the dialog window\n\n\nA: Expos\u00e9 for spaces and 'Show desktop' attached to corners of the screen. I've attached 'Show desktop' to my lower right corner, and Expos\u00e9 for spaces in the top left. Now, i can go bottom right to the desktop, grab a file, move over to the top left to switch to a space, and drop it there in a Finder window or Application.\n\nA: Do a \"killall dock\" in Terminal while a window is being minimized with the Genie effect (helps to hold down Shift to slow it down) and the window will be 'stuck' in the Genie effect yet still be operational! For example, you can still scroll.\n\nA: If you are a recent convert to osx and miss the mouse/cursor acceleration of a windows mouse?\nOSX mouse doesnt feel quite as good as the windows mouse?\nGive SteerMouse a try!\n\nA: There is a fast way to create a hidden folder on Mac OS.\nHidden folders a created by typing \".\" on the beginning (e.g. \".hiddenfolder\")\nThe Finder won't let you do this though.\nSo we gonna use the terminal.\nto create a new folder:\nmkdir .hiddenfolder\n\nfirst of course you have to navigate to the location, you want the folder to be.\nFor example the Desktop:\ncd /Users/USERNAME/Desktop/\n\nor drag a folder into the Terminal to get it's address\nTo know where you are right now, type:\npwd\n\nAnother way is, to rename a folder. To do so type:\nmv ActualFolderName .hiddenfolder\n\nTo open a hidden folder, make hidden files visible like described earlier,\nor use terminal (navigate there first, or type open absolute path)\nopen .hiddenfolder\n\nor if you are in the hidden folder already, just type\nopen .\n\nto show hidden folders/files in terminal type\nls -a\n\n\nA: If you drag files while holding the command key, the contents move but don't copy. Great for cutting the copy - then delete original process.\n\nA: Secrets by Blacktree is a preference pane which enables many hidden OS X and specific application preferences (e.g. change Dock to 2D, change iTunes stoplights back to horizontal). Saves you a couple of trips to the Terminal.\n\nA: Not sure if it's posted already but you can drag folders and files from the finder into an application's open / save dialogue. It sets the save or open path to that of the folder or file you're dragging. Excellent when you prefer to use the finder to navigate but don't want to repeat the process in your app or vice versa. Also, on many cases, whilst in the open / save dialogue, you can hit command R to reveal the files in the finder.\n\nA: You can \u2318-click and drag many OS provided icons from your menu bar to rearrange or remove them if it's getting too crowded.  Doesn't work with all 3rd party ones, but many built-in ones (like volume, battery, sync, bluetooth, etc) can be removed this way.   Many of them can be removed from the control panel, but this is the only way some of them can be removed once activated (that I'm aware of). \n\nA: I am new to Mac so this might be common knowledge but in snow leopard if you hold 3 and 2 during boot you will boot into 32 bit mode and the same goes foe 64 bit when holding the 6 and 4 keys during boot. Macfuse for example did not like running in 64 bit mode\n\nA: Hold ctrl and scroll with the mouse/trackpad in order to zoom the view at any time. Extremely handy in order to discern pixel differences of a UI.\n\nA: \u2318 + \u21e5 = switch between applications.\nPress \u2325 before releasing \u2318 and it will un-minimize minimized windows from that application.\n\nA: Hold Option & click Speaker/Volume icon in top menu bar to quickly select audio output and input devices (bluetooth, airplay etc.)\nvia https://twitter.com/justinerdman/status/316936844958916608\n\nA: Create a Keyboard Shortcut to open Terminal (or any application) no matter where you are or what application is currently active.\nUse Automator to create a Service. Within Actions choose Launch Application.\nIn my case I made sure that the service receives no input in any application.\nThen from the dropdown select other then double-click Utilities then select Terminal.app and click choose.\nSave the service and make sure it has a .workflow extension.\nNext open up System Preferences and click on the keyboard. Click the Shortcuts tab and select the Services option on the left.\nYou should see your new service in the General section named whatever you chose to name it. \nThen you can click the none button that indicates it has no shortcut yet and assign it whatever shortcut keys you want.\nThere are other ways but this works no matter what application is active and it never fails.\n\nA: Extremely quick way to open a new Finder window:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the desktop (even a sliver will do)\n\n*Hit \u2318N\nThe desktop is part of Finder, so in a lot of ways it acts as a Finder window itself.  For me it's faster to select the Finder app by just clicking on the desktop than to use Spotlight or to switch apps to Finder.\n\nA: During a spotlight search, hit \u2318B to Google that term in Safari.  Gives very quick access to a google search.\nI assume the search setting in Safari determines which search engine is used.\n\nA: In file open and file save dialogs: Hit \u2318+\u21e7+. to show all hidden files and folders.\nNote that this appears to be true for any keyboard, no matter what \u21e7+. on its own produces on that keyboard.\nThe commercial extension TotalFinder makes this feature available to normal Finder windows as well.\n\nA: *\n\n*When typing text in any document or text field \u2325 option+\u2190 backspace will delete the entire word, the same with \u2325 option+del which will delete the whole next word.\n\n*On MacBooks and aluminum keyboards, typing fn+\u2190 backspace leads to typing the del key, deleting the character in front of the cursor, not before it.\n\n*Using an accented language? Press \u2303 ctrl+\u2190 backspace after an accented letter to delete just the accent, not the letter.\n\nA: I still think \u2318 + \u2325 + \u21e7 + v (paste without style) is very handy.\nThat is, when something is on the clipboard and has unwanted styles along for the ride, this keyboard shortcuts lets you paste just the plain text without any formatting.\n\nA: In iTunes pressing \u2318 + L brings you to the song playing right now.\nHelpful if you lost yourself in your collection or are in iTunes Store and want to change something real quick.\nVery useful in combination with \u2318 + I to show the details of the currently playing song.\n\nA: Have a menu command/keyboard shortcut that you know exists, but you can't find it (or just don't want to touch your mouse)?\nPress \u2318-\u21e7-/ to get to the help menu.  It'll pop up the help menu that you can type into.  Type the word you want to search the menus for, then \u2193 to the menu item you want.  OSX will helpfully show you where that item exists in the menu with a big blue arrow and you'll also see any associated shortcuts.\n\n\nA: Also TinkerTool shows some hidden features\n\nA: Safari also supports a subset of Emacs keybindings\n\nA: If you want to Open/Close FrontRow just use \u2318 + esc\n\nA: One of the most amazing things I know to do in the terminal is \"doctor terminal\" I just love it! :D\nI know it's a silly program that's easy to make but, no other operating system has it.\nThis is accessed through emacs in the Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type emacs\n\n*Press Ctrl+X\n\n*Type doctor\n\n*Press Return\nAfter each question, you can recieve a response by pressing Return twice in a row.\n\nA: \u2318 + ctrl + \"two finger swipe\" = change the opacity of the window under the cursor\n\nA: In an any Open/Save dialog, you can use Quicksilver to quickly find the desired file or folder and just drag it anywhere into the file dialog, sendig the file chooser directly to that location. [Enter] will do the rest.\n(While not included in OSX, I assume, that the majority of users interested in this thread do run Quicksilver.app)\n\nA: Custom Alert Sounds - An old trick from OS9 days (tested to 10.8) is to create your own alert sounds. Not entirely productive but if you are into hacking your Mac / OS to make it your own, this is one on the list - it's fun to have Peter Griffin tell you it's time for lunch.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Sample your sound file as usual (download or record/input to the Mac using something like Sound Studio or QT Pro 7). \n\n*edit down to 10 seconds or less adding a clean entry and exit\n\n*export as an AIFF file\n\n*place here: /System/Library/Sounds/*\n\n*select the alert sound via the System Preferences / Sound / Sound Effects panel\n\n\nNote: the Library folder may be invisible by default. If so open terminal and add the following to make it permanently visible: \nchflags nohidden ~/Library/\n\nNote2: this route path will facilitate a sound file available to all users on your Mac. You can keep it to yourself by placing the AIFF here: \n/Users/username/Library/Sounds/\n\n\nA: Text Edit - restore zoom feature in 10.7 / 10.8+\nThis is a helpful tip to remedy Apple's less than useful update to the ubiquitous Text Edit application from OS 10.7 following which they removed the incremental 'Zoom' control shown below.\n\nI am aware of the keyboard shortcuts CMD + and CMD - that work post 10.7, however, the zoom increments with this method are pre-fixed and too large for me - I am most comfortable with 125% and to be honest, I am bugged that a useful function has been removed. So the action:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the default version of Text Edit in the system / apps folder (you can drag this app to the trash or use a program like AppZapper). If you go the manual method, delete the preferences file as well.\n\n*beg, steal or borrow a copy of OS 10.6. Most regular Mac users will have one archived (I have Mac OS's back to 6.5, although I am sad).\n\n*drag a copy of Text Edit 1.7.1 (or earlier - 1.6 should work from OS 10.5) to your current applications folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select any text edit document, get info (CMD + I) and set Text Edit 1.7.1 as the default application to open this type of file. \n\n\nNote: you may get an error message from Text Edit stating that it cannot save the file due to a permissions error. Don't worry, the file is being saved OK under OS 10.7+ and the false flag is due to an Apple change in the way newer versions of Text Edit auto-save. To suspend this reporting, you can soft hack Text Edit 1.7.1's behavior in terminal with the following command.\ndefaults write -app textedit ApplePersistence -bool false\ndefaults write -app textedit AutosavingDelay -int 0\nHope you find this tip helpful.\n\nA: You can drag-drop Finder objects (or any document window's proxy icons) while doing any of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*App-Switching (\u2318+Tab or \u2318+\u21e7+Tab), \n\n*Spaces (\u2303+\u2192 or \u2303+\u2190), \n\n*Show Desktop (\u2318+F3), or \n\n*Mission Control (\u2303+\u2191).\n\n\nCombined with dropping into open/save dialogues, this means you'll never have to navigate to a file in one app and then navigate to the same file again in the open/save dialog. You'll also never have move windows around in order to drop a file into Safari.\nEg. I have an image open in Preview, and want to send it as an attachment in gmail.\n\n\n*\n\n*Gmail pops open the \"select attachment\" file dialogue:\n\n\n*Start dragging the proxy Icon from Preview - don't let go of it\n\n\n*While continuing to drag the file, switch apps with \u2318+Tab.\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep holding \u2318, but release/hit Tab or \u21e7+Tab repeatedly to get to Safari.\n\n*Let go of \u2318 once Safari is selected, to bring it to the front.\n\n\n\n*Drop the file onto the file dialogue, and it'll become selected.\n\nFile is selected and ready to send. Return to finish selecting the file.\n\nIf you save screenshots to the desktop, then a similar trick is useful with the \"Show Desktop\" keyboard shortcut (\u2318+F3).\n\nA: Quickly insert weird characters into text by setting Text-Replacement Keyboard Shortcuts for any characters you find in the \"Emoji & Symbols\" panel.\nI personally use LaTeX-style shortcuts, so typing \\arrowright gets replaced with \u2192. Type a Space after the \\arrowright to do the replacement.\nSet your shortcuts in SysPrefs > Keyboard > Text\n\nYou can copy/paste characters from anywhere into the Replace With... column. I prefer to double-click characters from the Emoji & Symbols pane, so I know they're in the standard font packages. The Emoji & Symbols pane can be enabled by selecting\nSysPrefs > Keyboard > Keyboard (tab) > Show Keyboard and Emoji Viewers in menu bar\nand then choosing Emoji & Symbols in the resulting menu item:\n\n\nA: Ever downloaded an app that Mac OS won't let you open because it's \"from an unidentified developer\"?\nInstead of completely disabling this security feature (via SysPrefs>Security), try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click the .app file\n\n*hold Shift while clicking Open.  \n\n*The resulting warning now has an [Open] button, click it.\n\n*The warning is circumvented for this app only, but still enabled system-wide. It will never warn you again for that particular app.\n\n\nA: In TextEdit, you can go to a specific line number by hitting \u2318L. Useful if a script errors at a specific line number.\n\n\nA: If you have an iPhone (or iPad) with iOS 12, and a Mac with macOS Mojave, you can use the iPhone as a scanner or photo camera to directly scan documents or take photos. The scanner will even rotate and resize the document so that it appears as a rectangle. This function is integrated in a few Apple apps like Finder, Mail, Messages and the iWork apps.\n\nFor more information, see the Apple Support article Use Continuity Camera on your Mac.\n\nA: On newer versions of macOS , you can access an interactive tool for taking screenshots via \u2318+Shift+5.\nModes\nYou can use three different modes.\nCapture/Record Entire Screen\nThis mode is basic and lets you capture the entire screen. It replicates the functionality of \u2318+Shift+3.\nCapture/Record Selected Portion\nThis mode allows you to crop out parts of the screen beforehand. You can move or resize the selected portion. The width and height of the portion will appear while resizing. This mode replicates the functionality of \u2318+Shift+4.\nCapture Selected Window\nThis screenshot-exclusive mode allows you to take a screenshot of a window. Windows include context menus and other UI items as well. This mode replicates the functionality of \u2318+Shift+4 after pressing Space and selecting a window.\nPreview/Markup\nAfter capturing your screenshot or recording, you can view a preview of it. Right-clicking this preview allows you to set its save location, open it, delete it, or use Markup.\n\nMarkup editor allows you to draw freehand circles, add text, crop, or rotate screenshots.\n\nThe Markup editor also allows you to trim recordings.\n\n\nA: By long-pressing on the bookmarks tab on the sidebar, you can open a menu containing the structure of the bookmarks folder. You can move your mouse to jump to a folder from this menu.\n\n\nA: This is a pretty common one, but to show all hidden files you can type the command\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles 1\n\nand then\nkillall Finder\n\nin Terminal.\nTo reverse, repeat using a 0 instead of 1.\n\nA: Image Wells\nAll good mac programs contain image wells for opening files, such as the Desktop & Screen Saver pane in System Preferences:  \n1[]1\nor in Filemerge:\n\nThis nifty litte things allow you to drag-and-drop files into them (and in some cases, out of) to load them into the program. Here, I am changing the wallpaper by dragging the file out of Finder and into the image well:\n\n\nA: In the terminal, you can pipe the output of any command to pbcopy to copy it to the system clipboard. You can also paste from the system clipboard using pbpaste, and pipe that to another command or write the value directly to a file:\nCopy a string: echo \"ohai im in ur clipboardz\" | pbcopy\nCopy the HTML of StackOverflow.com: curl \"http://stackoverflow.com/\" | pbcopy\nOpen a new buffer in VIM, initialized to the content of the clipboard: pbpaste | vim -\nSave the contents of the clipboard directly to a file: pbpaste > newfile.txt\n\nA: Disable Caps-Lock\nThe ability to disable the Caps Lock key is wonderful (open System Preferences, go to Keyboard, then click the button titled Special Keys or Modifier Keys). It is not really hidden, but I never need the key, but especially on my MacBook I sometimes hit it by fault.\nSome people also use this panel to replace Caps Lock with Control. Especially useful when you're using Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E shortcuts a lot.\n\nA: You can add spacers to your Dock. Some apps make them for you or you can use the Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{tile-data={}; tile-type=\"spacer-tile\";}'\n\nAfterwards, use the following command to restart your dock:\nkillall Dock\n\nYou will see a spacer appear. Like normal apps, they can be removed and repositioned by dragging.\nYou can add spacers multiple times by repeating the first command. For example, this Dock has 2 spacers:\n\n\nA: I always find the \u2318+\u21e7+4, space (you must press space at the end otherwise it doesn't work) command is really useful, and one that a lot of people don't know you can do. Upon pressing space, you get a large camera icon for your cursor, and it allows you to take a screenshot just of the highlighted window. The nice thing is that OS X preserves the window drop shadow, with full alpha transparency. So when you paste the images into other documents, they look fab.\n\nMore screenshot magic from 3rdparty.\nScreenshot Secrets via: http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2006/01/01/mac-os-x-screenshot-secrets.html:\n\n\n*\n\n*\u2318+\u21e7+3  Capture entire screen and save as a file\n\n*\u2318+ctrl+\u21e7+3  Capture entire screen and copy to the clipboard\n\n*\u2318+\u21e7+4  Capture dragged area and save as a file\n\n*\u2318+ctrl+\u21e7+4  Capture dragged area and copy to the clipboard\n\n*\u2318+\u21e7+4 then space    Capture a window, menu, desktop icon, or the menu bar and save as a file\n\n*\u2318+ctrl+\u21e7+4 then space    Capture a window, menu, desktop icon, or the menu bar and copy to the clipboard\n\n*Another useful trick is to hold space while drawing a capture area to reposition it.\n\n*Another trick is to hold option while drawing a capture area, to resize the area in all directions, instead of just the one corner you're dragging.\n\n*For fine-tuning on a certain axis, you can hold shift and the axis you next move in is the one you'll control.\n\n*Hit esc while capturing an area or window to exit capture mode.\nNote: I added this because I find it to be useful. I don't mean any offense to anyone's answer in doing so.\n\nA: You can increase or decrease your volume, brightness, or keyboard backlighting brightness by quarter increments by using the following combination:\n\u2325 + \u21e7 + Volume Up/Down\n\nNote that this feature was disabled in Mac OS X Lion from 10.7 through 10.7.3. This feature was restored in 10.7.4.  For workarounds on how to accomplish this on earlier Lion versions, see this question.\n\nA: *\n\n*Hold down the \u2318 key to drag a background window by its title bar without focusing it or bringing it to front\n\n*\u2325-click in a scrollbar's empty space to scroll to the clicked place (instead of scrolling up or down one page). You can switch this behavior in the Appearance panel of System Preferences.\n\n*\u2318-click on the name of a page in Safari's title bar to show the URL path as a menu. Select to browse (this is the same as \u2318-clicking the title in document windows).\n\nA: My favorite trick is using Expos\u00e9 with drag and drop. Once you've started dragging something you can use the Expos\u00e9 keyboard shortcut, switch to the application you want to drag it to, and drop it wherever it's needed. It's great for doing things like adding images to a presentation.\n\nA: While \u2318+Tab-ing between applications, without releasing \u2318, you can hit Q to quit or H to hide the selected application. Works great with the mouse to get rid of a whole bunch of applications quickly.\nThe bevel won't go away and you can repeat this for as many applications as you like as long as you're holding \u2318.\nIf you have multiple windows of an app, use key 1, \u2191, or \u2193 to reveal the windows while that app is highlighted in the application switching strip. i.e.: while \u2318+Tab-ing, when you highlight the app with multiple windows, keep \u2318 held down and press one of those keys. Then use mouse to go that window. \n\nA: Holding \u2325  (Option)while clicking menu bar icons will give you additional menu items or alternate menus. The alternate volume control menu will let you choose input and output audio devices.\n\nBonus: On older versions of OS X, this gave you the alert volume instead of devices. You can still get the alert volume using \u21e7 clicking.\nFor the airport menu, you'll get WiFi connection information. \n\nThe Bluetooth menu will include debugging information and tools.\n\nTime Machine will show \"Verify Backups\" and \"Browse Other Time Machine Disks\". Unlike the other menus, the Time Machine menu will show the alternates if you hold Option after opening the menu, and will hide them if you release it.\n\nA: When clicking from one application's window to another's, holding down \u2325 while clicking will automatically hide the former app's windows.\n\nA: When you're \u2318+\u21e5 between running applications, if you press \u2325 before releasing command, it will raise minimized windows from the dock.  Otherwise, you may be in an application, but without a raised window.\nAlso, while \u2318+\u21e5 goes to the right through the application list, \u2318+\u21e7+\u21e5goes left.  \u2318+ backtick (`) also goes left.\nctrl+\u2325+\u2318-8 inverts the screen.  Sometimes useful for whacky lighting situations, especially with glossy screens.\n\nA: On any open file or save file dialog instead of searching for the file, you can grab any from the finder...\n\nAnd drop it in the window to select it! \n\nThis little trick has saved me hours in looking for files to be opened. You can also drop files directy on the file fiedls of any webpage.\n \nSpecially useful tricks when you have files on your desktop or a finder window! Hope it helps!\n\nA: Proxy icons\nIn a document-based application (like Finder, TextEdit, Preview, Pages\u2026), after a document has been saved, a proxy icon for the document appears in the title bar. It represent the file itself, and can be likewise manipulated:\n\n*\n\n*click it for a few seconds and drag to another application to open it, or to the desktop/Finder if you want to copy/move it, etc\u2026\n\n*\u2318-click (or control-click, or right-click) it to view the path menu, useful to open the folder or any subfolders of the file in the Finder.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\u2318-click on the titlebar in Safari can help you easily move up the directory structure of a web site, too!\n\n\n\n*Since Mountain Lion you can edit the document titles:\n\n\nA: Pressing \u21e7 + \u2318 + W will close all windows of an application at once, in most apps.\n\nA: Regarding tips and tricks. The most annoying part of MacOS for me always was the inability to put dock on the side of a middle monitor in multi monitor setup.\nI've managed to achieve it with a help of Wraparound app (Free). It wraps mouse around your monitors so you can setup you monitors arrangement so the monitor you want your dock to be on would be first (if you want dock on left) or last (if you want it on right) and then just wrap mouse movement horizontally.\nHere is example of my monitor arrangement before\n\nand this is after\n\nand here's how Wraparounds settings look\n\nso in the end my real setup looks like this \n\nThe only thing that doesn't work is dragging window from middle monitor to the left, it seems to work for an instant but then gets teleported back. But I'm using Spectacle app (Free) to manage windows and I use a shortcut to move windows between monitors so that's not a problem for me at all.\n\nA: I frequently use the shortcut: Shift + Home and Shift + End to jump to the begining and end (respectively) of a long command in Terminal. It is one of the most useful commands I have discovered for macOS to date.\n\nA: Advanced cursor navigation for text.\n\n\n*\n\n*optionleft/right arrow \u2013\u00a0Move cursor to previous/next word break.\n\n*commandleft/right arrow \u2013\u00a0Move cursor to start/end of line.\n\n*commandup/down arrow \u2013\u00a0Move cursor to top/bottom of textarea.\n\n*shiftleft/right arrow \u2013\u00a0Highlight left/right character.\n\n*shiftcommandleft/right arrow \u2013\u00a0Highlight left/right word.\n\n*shiftcommandup/down arrow \u2013\u00a0Highlight text to start/end of line.\n\n*optiondelete \u2013\u00a0Delete word.\n\n*commanddelete \u2013\u00a0Delete line.\n\n\nA: If you use a second monitor this one helped a lot\nfn + \u2318 + \u2193 - combines the contents of both screens into one\n\nA: I love the fact that OS X will scroll the window that the mouse is hovering over, even if another application has focus.  That way I can scroll an example that I am coding in TextMate without having to lose keyboard control on TM\n\nA: Use widget in Desktop:\nThis allows you to drag widgets out of Dashboard onto the desktop.

You can launch Spotlight by pressing \u2318 + space. Once Spotlight is launched, type in application name and press enter.\nSo to start Safari without using the mouse, type:\n\u2318 + space -> \"Safari\" -> \u21a9\n\nA: You can change screen brightness in quarter intervals by pressing \u2325 + \u21e7 + Brightness Up / Down:\n\n\nA: I searched through all 5 pages of this thread and I'm surprised to find that nobody already mentioned this handy tip for Terminal.app:\nPress ctrl+R to bring up a search through your command history. It's a somewhat fuzzy search in that what you're typing doesn't have to be the initial characters of a command, but it still must be a contiguous section of the command.\nFor example, you could find a previous usage of curl by typing \"rl\" in the search... or \"post\" if the curl command you want to find was a POST.\nYou can also use the Up & Down arrows to flip through just the matching commands in your history.\n\nA: I prefer using the keyboard. Some shortcuts that kind of work together in Finder:\n\n\n*\n\n*\u2318 + \u2191 = Go to parent directory\n\n*\u2318 + \u2193 = Open selected directory/file\n\n*\u2325\u2318 + 2 = Clean up by type (see navigation bar for all the alternatives)\n\n\nAnd something I use all the time:\nWhen copy-pasting, \u2325\u2318 + v (normal copy-pasting, but adding the option key when pasting) will move the file instead of copying it.\n\nA: While typing, just press F5 to get suggestions for what you're typing (almost equivalent to spell-check suggestions). Example:\n\n\nA: You can click on Dock app icons with modifier keys for special functions relating to that app:\n\n\n*\n\n*With the \u2318 key pressed, the clicked application will be shown in a Finder window (via @Mactip).\n\n*With the \u2325 key pressed, the clicked application will be hidden if it is visible.\n\n\nA: \u2318 + click on the title bar at the top of a Safari window to get a menu of URLs, each the same as the previous but with the last path component removed. Like this:\n\n\nA: When you use \u2318 + \u21e5 to switch tabs, you can continue to hold \u2318 down and drag a file into any icon in the bezel.\nCombined with the trick of dragging from the proxy icon in the menubar, this is a powerful way to open a file in another application, especially if you rarely use your dock.\n\nA: In Safari, on a page that wants you to select a file for upload, instead of clicking \"browse\", you can usually just drag a file directly to the \"browse\" button. It will set the filename without even opening up the file dialog. \nSlightly recursive example below :)\n\n\nA: It\u2019s possible to set a blazingly fast keyboard repeat rate, much faster than the maximum possible setting in System Preferences \u2192 Keyboard \u2192 Keyboard \u2192 Key Repeat.\n\nThe trick is to use this command in Terminal.app:\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 0\n\nAfter that, log out and back in, or just reopen all applications.\nDisclaimer: This is just one of the many goodies in my .osx file.\n\nA: In Finder, select any number of files. Press \u2318 + ctrl + N to automatically have them moved to a new folder. \nGreat if you forgot to create a new folder before selecting files, and in general.\n\nA: This isn't really a \"feature\", just a way to customize OS X, but I still think it's useful:\nYou can edit the icons used by OS X at /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources\nYou can also change the login screen to your liking here\n/System/Library/CoreServices/SecurityAgentPlugins/loginwindow.bundle/Contents/Resources\n\nThere are so many ways to customize OS X... the dock, for example (/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources)\nAnd you don't really need to \"resource hack\" anything: just backup and change a couple png or tif files!\n\nA: The speech synthesizer, which is available from the command line, with the command say, knows how to correctly pronounce the operating system name:\nsay Mac OS X\n\nIt won't say \"MacOSex\", but \"Mac OhEs Ten\". That's attention to detail. It works even if you specify macosx as the argument.\n\nA: In Terminal (Applications/Utilities/Terminal), open can be pretty handy. It can:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*launch programs by exact path to the executable\n  \n*launch any program in the PATH directories by executable name\n  \n\nIn Terminal, type open -a Application to launch an application that lives in the /Applications folder, or open <exact path to applcation> to launch an application that is anywhere on your computer.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*open files in default applications\n  \n\nJust us open <file>. open song.mp3 will open song.mp3 in the default audio player (in my case iTunes)\n\n  \n*\n  \n*open files with other applications\n  \n\nOpen a file with Mail.app (i.e. mail the file) open -a Mail homework.txt\n\n  \n*\n  \n*open a Finder window into a local directory\n  \n*open a Finder window into a network share\n  \n\nopen /Path/to/dir/ will launch the folder in Finder, whereas open . will open the current folder in Finder.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*open any URL with its default handler (e.g. a browser)\n  \n\nopen http://google.com will launch the default browser and open the url. It also works for FTP (but i have not tested anything else)\nFor more, just run man open in Terminal or see this page.\nFrom Super User\n\nA: It took me a while before I figured out that hitting the space bar while in Finder launches Quick Look on whatever is selected. VERY handy.\nAlso note that holding \u2325 while doing this throws you straight into the full-screen view.\n\nA: In most Mac apps (TextEdit, for example), you can \u2325-drag* to select a rectangular area of non-contiguous text.\n\nYou can also hold \u2318 while dragging to select multiple disjoint areas in a single selection.\n*Hold \u2325 while dragging your mouse over an area\n\nA: Running \npmset noidle\n\nor\ncaffeinate\n\nin Terminal will prevent your Mac from sleeping. Press Ctrl+C to stop.\n\nA: *\n\n*Select a bunch of text and drag to the desktop and it will make a text clipping.\n\n*Drag it back to a text window and it will dump the text there.\n\n*Double-click and you can view the  selectively copy for pasting elsewhere.\n\n*Install the quicklook extension and you can view text and pict clippings in quicklook.\n\n\nA: Hold down \u2325 and click TimeMachine Icon in the menubar. Now you can search/restore from other backups\nvia @MacTip\n\nA: In Terminal, if you hold option, your cursor turns into a small \"+\". While holding option, you can use this to highlight and copy any square/rectangular area of text instead of whole lines at a time.\n\nA: Often a simple spotlight query isn't enough.\nThe shortcut \u2325+\u2318+space brings up the powerful finder search window no matter what app is running.\nNot only can you use the normal search types like kind:app or kind:mail but you can force spotlight to show you files that are normally hidden.\nThis is particularly useful to search for and inside hidden system files such as .ipsw packages, detailed logs and CoreServices utilities.\n\nYou may want to add System files to your default search menu for quicker access.\n\n\n*\n\n*first click the circle plus to the far right of the Save button to show the optional search filters\n\n*then choose other under the Kind dropdown \n\n*lastly search for System and check the include toggle.\n\n\nA: While you are using \u2318 + \u21e5 to cycle through open applications, you can press Q before you release \u2318 to close the app. You can close several apps before release \u2318.\n\nA: A handy tip I discovered by accident.\nHighlight any file in an Open dialogue window, press the space bar and voila! there is your file in all it's glory.\n\nA: Use this plugin to allow QuickLook to view animated GIFs - Animated GIF QuickLook For Mac 1.0\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "604"}}

{"text": "Q: What is the best option to protect our Laptop? Because any MacBook Pro in a table can be easily pick up by thieves, and we do have always our current work there (though all backed up, by Dropbox or external HD), my question is\n\nShould we protect the access to our hard drive? \n\nYou would probably, if you travel a lot say yes, but\n\nWhat software should we use to protect our work with a password?\n\n... and, for example, after 3 wrong attempts, maybe erase all folders that we specified without an option to get it back?\nKinda like what iPhone give us in a business environment that we can, remotely, erase all personal data. \n\nA: Install Prey.\n\n\"Prey is a lightweight application\n  that will help you track and find your\n  laptop if it ever gets stolen. It\n  works in all operating systems and not\n  only is it Open Source but also\n  completely free.\"\n\n\nA: For starters, encrypting your Home folder using FileVault (in the Security Preferences pane) is always a good idea. You might notice a bit of a performance hit (some people say they do, others don't notice a difference), but the tradeoff of additional security can give you some extra peace of mind.\nAs far as an iPhone-esque \"wipe memory after [x] failed login attempts\" function, the OS doesn't have anything like that built in, so you'd need to search out a 3rd party solution. I don't have any recommendations offhand for that, but likely someone else here could point you in the right direction.\n\nA: I bought a cable lock that I use whenever I'm not at home and need to step away from my laptop, even if only for a few moments.  I lock the screen with password protection and attach the cable lock to the laptop and something that would be difficult if not impossible to move.\n\nA: The already mentioned FileVault will certainly help, but it must be coupled with a strong password. \nIn any case, the FileVault solution sometimes proves to be a problem, as it is known to have inconvenience to some pieces of software. If your intention is to completely wipe the system you have a few alternatives:\n1) One would be to use a service like Lojack for Laptops, that has the option to remotely wipe the box. It\u2019s basically has a service that will connect every 15 mins to their server to \u201ccheck\u201d if the Laptop is ok, if not, it will proceed to do different things (erasing information being one of the options).\n2) You could do the above if you have scripting abilities and a webserver that you can upload files to. The basic idea consists in creating a script that will be executed upon boot (using Launchd), that will connect to your webserver and check for the existence of a file. E.g.: www.yourserver.com/mycomputer_erase.txt\nIf the file is found, then the script can execute a series of commands or something as simple as: \nrm -rf /Users/youruser\n\nYou can go beyond that and use applescript to perform other tasks, like taking pictures or uploading stuff via ftp or even dropbox. \nThe concerns about #2 are: \nWhat if I want to know where my laptop is? You can check your webserver logs to see who accessed the file and when. \nWhat if my laptop gets erased before they turn it on or connect it? Well, this is basically not your problem, as you want your data to be erased, not your laptop to be recovered :)\nLooking for a solution like #2, I came across this -not so new- post of a guy who did it with a Perl script. The post is from 2006, but it may help you go in the right direction. You can find it here.\nIn any case, all of the above could be certainly used in conjunction with FileVault. \nFinally, make sure you have a backup of your data before experimenting with the scripts (or at least change the \u2018rm\u2019 command to something harmless ;)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/421", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}
{"text": "Q: Are there any apps to diagnose a Macbook battery? My girlfriend's battery won't last 1 second, so it obviously needs replaced.\nBut I just bought a new battery from Apple a few months ago and it seems to discharge extremely quickly.  Are there any apps out there that would help me diagnose if I just need to buy another new one?\n\nA: They are several solutions : \n\n\n*\n\n*coconutBattery, the most famous one.\n\n*Watts seems nice even if I never manage to finish to calibration setup \u2026\n\n*Battery Health if you want a free one.\n\n\nYou can also use the built-in tool System Profiler to check your battery : \n\n\n\n\nA: I can suggest some easy hint to inform you about the health of your battery:\ngo to utilities > System Profiler      select Hardware > Power > Battery Information\nThe third section is Health Information, where you can find out the current condition of your battery. As in the following screenshot, the Cycle count is 213, which means the battery has been discharged and recharged 213 times. And its current Condition is Normal.\n\nAlso, you can install Battery Health Monitor to get more information about your battery.\n\nAlso, it's a good read about the maximum Cycle count of your battery\n\nA: On my MacBook, if I opt-click on the battery in my menu bar, it gives me current the condition of my battery.\n\nYou can also use iStat to show the current state of your battery.\n\n\nA: While it's possible it's a bad battery - what programs are running on the computer? If you use Activity Monitor is CPU usage consistently \"high\" (say >50% in this case)?\nPrograms such as coconutBattery can give you the stats on your battery - telling you how much of a charge your battery still holds and how many load cycles have been done on your battery. If your current Battery capacity is under 25% it may very well be a good time to get a new battery. Under 10% for sure. If the new battery is less than 50% battery capacity in less than 6 months give AppleCare a call, they do have a warranty on their batteries but it's relatively limited.\n\nA: Coconut Battery will provide you the vitals on your batteries capacity, as well as how much that capacity has deteriorated since purchase. In general though, the Battery is pretty unlikely to be the actual problem. Check your power settings, particularly if you have a Pro machine with dual graphics cards.\nIn addition, I've noticed substantial improvements in the accuracy of the on-screen 'remaining power' estimates on brand new macs by 'calibrating' the battery as Apple recommends -  essentially, charge the laptop to full, then use it until the battery is completely empty, then charge it up to full once more.\n\nA: There are obviously a lot of factors to consider (machine specs, what apps your running, etc.), but if you want a sanity check from someone who had a similar experience:\nI replaced a basically dead battery in a same-era MacBook, and the new battery never lasted longer than two hours (although the battery indicator often claimed it would go for 3ish), and generally went down after closer to one if I was using wifi, processor-intensive apps, etc.\n\nA: When you say \"extremely quickly,\" how long are you talking about? One hour? 90 minutes? 30 minutes?\nMy early-2008 MBP with the original battery will still squeeze in two downloaded episodes of a 1-hr TV show without commercials (so think about 90 minutes of full-screen video) before the battery goes flat. iStat is still reporting the battery health at around 80%.\n\nA: Battery Health Monitor has a nice clean UI; but it seems to have been last updated years ago. The documentation says it is \"a handy utility for PowerBook and iBook users.\" Not encouraging given that I have a MacBook Pro, and the first of those were introduced in 2006. It does seem to produce sensible output that agrees with System Profiler, however.\n\nA: I believe the rated life of the old 2007 MacBook batteries is 4-5 hours of use. Though actual time will be different depending on your usage (heavy WIFI usage, watching videos, etc. will drain your battery quicker). If you're getting significantly less than that off a brand new battery, it is probably defective.\n\nA: I have a late 2007 MBP, and have had bad luck with battery life. Fortunately for me, Apple has been kind enough to replace them.\nIf your battery is less than a year old, and iStat says the health is abnormally low (70% is the guideline I've seen), try taking it to the Genius bar; they may replace it under warranty.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/427", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

If you are on a Mac looking for a blog editor app, you should try it. You can download the beta for free at:\nhttp://www.getblogo.com\nThere is also a cross platform solution called BlueGriffon that looks promising.\nMy current recommendation and favorite is Blogo.\n\nEasily publish text, images, videos, slideshows and more. \n  With a simple, intuitive interface and support for Wordpress, Blogger, Typepad, Typo, Drupal, Joomla, and Expression Engine, Blogo is the best \n  way to maintain your blog and spread the word with Twitter, Ping.fm and other supported services.\n\nIt also supports Twitter.\nThe closest to WLW would be Ecto, but active development seems to have stopped.\n\nA: I have heard great things about MarsEdit, but have never used it myself. One that I have used quite a bit is MacJournal, which I know has blog-publishing support (in addition to functioning as a journal and/or notebook, which is what I mostly use it for). Without having put a lot of effort into figuring it out, I do feel like formatting posts can be a bit of a hassle in MacJournal, but I have used it for LJ publishing with okay results. All in all, I have probably heard more good things about MarsEdit for blog-publishing, but figured MacJournal deserved being mentioned, at least, as an alternative.\n\nA: Byword 2\nIn Byword 2, you can publish your Markdown content directly to blogs such as WordPress (both self-hosted and WordPress.com), and Tumblr.\n\n\nA: Qumana\n\nThis simple desktop editing tool allows you to write and save posts to your hard drive, while also posting to any of your blogs, anywhere. Never lose a post again.\n\nThingamablog\n\nA cross-platform (Linux, Mac, Windows), standalone blogging application that makes authoring and publishing your weblogs almost effortless. Unlike most blogging solutions, Thingamablog does NOT require a third-party blogging host, a cgi/php enabled web host, or a MySQL database. In fact, all you need to setup, and manage, a blog with Thingamablog is FTP, SFTP, or network access to a web server.\n\nPixelPumper\n\nWith PixelPumper, you can now create, edit and publish your blog posts directly from OS X in a beautiful retina display interface. It doesn't matter if you host your blog on WordPress.com or self-host, PixelPumper allows you to post to either.\n\nJust like Live Writer helps you update your WordPress blogs easily while still being inside your desktop environment and not opening the browser. The app is available for free in the Mac App Store and measures only about 4.8 MB in size.\nEdit\nAlso of interest is Ghost:\nMore information about it can be seen from its Kickstarter campaign and Official website.\n\nA: If you are using Markdown, you can try WordMark.

TextMate can also show you live preview of your HTML in a separate window.\nOf course, being a specialized application, MarsEdit is more feature rich in the blogging sense but TextMate has a better editor (obviously).\n\nA: SmartXBlog is desktop blog editor for both Windows and Mac. It has WYSIWYG editor, image editor, online content search and RSS feed available from nearly 100 popular websites and you can even add your own RSS and drag and drop your result to editor.

{"text": "Q: How can I use NTFS partitions in OS X? My coworkers use NTFS partitions, and I can't share my data with them, as NTFS on Mac OS X is read-only.\nHow can I read and write onto NTFS partitions?\n\nA: I payed(34$) for the full NTFS driver from Tuxera, the free version was not able to safely eject NTFS disks.\nUpdate: starting with Lion, you'll not be able to share the NTFS drives even if you use NTFS-3G or Tuxera NTFS for Mac.\nIt may be a good idea to reformat your drive to EXFAT in order to overcome these issues. I know it's a real pain and time killer.\n\nA: You have 3 main choices : \n\n\n*\n\n*NTFS-3G (free one)\n\n*Paragon NTFS (paid one)\n\n\nand even a built-in solution inside Mac OS X.\n\nA: If you're running Snow Leopard, don't bother with various MacFUSE based solutions - NTFS support is built in, but disabled by default. To enable it, read this.\n\nSnow Leopard has the ability to mount NTFS volumes as read/write, but it's not enabled by default -- just read only is supported, as in 10.5. Here's how to get full read/write support for NTFS drives in Snow Leopard. First, uninstall NTFS-3G or Paragon if you're using either one.\nHere's how to get read/write support for NTFS drives in Snow Leopard:\n\n*\n\n*In Terminal, type diskutil info /Volumes/volume_name, where volume_name is the name of the NTFS volume. From the output, copy the Volume UUID value to the clipboard.\n\n\n*Back up /etc/fstab if you have it; it shouldn't be there in a default install.\n\n\n*Type sudo nano /etc/fstab.\n\n\n*In the editor, type UUID=, then paste the UUID number you copied from the clipboard. Type a Space, then type none ntfs rw. The final line should look like this: UUID=123-456-789 none ntfs rw, where 123-456-789 is the UUID you copied in the first step.\n\n\n*Repeat the above steps for any other NTFS drives/partitions you have.\n\n\n*Save the file and quit nano (Control-X, Y, Enter), then restart your system.\nAfter rebooting, NTFS partitions should natively have read and write support. This works with both 32- and 64-bit kernels. Support is quite good and fast, and it even recognizes file attributes such as hidden files. My thanks go to Chrysaor, a MacRumors user who brought this to our attention.\n\nAlternately, you could use NTFSMounter, for a GUI utility to do the same thing.\n\nA: For free, you can use the NTFS-3G driver. In order to use it, you have to install MacFUSE first.\nIn the end, you'll have a prefpane to mount and manage your NTFS drives\n\n\nA: I use NTFS-3G with really good success, never lost a bit also sharing the same disk with windows machines and a WD media player connected to my TV.\nOnly very minor issue I've found was that to proper reclaim space from the disk when I delete file I need to run a Maintenance utility or the Disk Utiity to recover space.\nSee also http://www.phillo.it/?p=9\n\nA: Here is a good description how to access NTFS partitions.

{"text": "Q: How do I uninstall a program completely on a Mac? I come from a PC background... every time I want to uninstall an application, I must use add/remove programs. On the mac, you can simply run a .app file from wherever you want, and many say that the way to uninstall them is simply delete this .app file.\nHowever, I have noticed that many apps save files in the ~/Library/Application Support/ directory. So when I delete the .app file, all those files are retained in the Application Support directory. Isn't there any way to uninstall an app and have it remove everything it installed on my hard-drive?\n\nA: Also bear in mind that many applications will include an uninstall option as part of their installation package, either as a separate program/script within the .DMG file or as a specific option in the installation wizard itself.\nSo although it might seem counter-intuitive, it's often worth mounting the original .DMG file (that you downloaded) again, and having a look for anything marked 'uninstall' - you sometimes find that utility program, driver-type packages and large games do tend to include software to clean-up after themselves.\nIf I come across a couple of examples in the next day or so, I'll edit this to include their names.\n\nA: AppZapper\nAppZapper is by far my favorite way to remove an Application and clean up any associated files in Preferences or Application Support.\nAlso, here's a tip.  Drag AppZapper to your Finder's toolbar like so.  This will then give you the ability to drag applications you want to uninstall by dragging the application on top of the the AppZapper shortcut in the toolbar.\n\n\nA: You can use this free app:\nAppCleaner\n(Synium used to offer CleanApp, but the product has been discontinued. You can still download a demo version which supports OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion up to macOS 10.14 Mojave.)\n\nA: AppCleaner all the way. The vast majority of apps on the Mac are self-contained, which is why there's no built-in uninstall method in Mac OS X. The only exception to that is plist files - essentially just application preferences. These are tiny text files and usually inconsequential if left behind when you remove an app. (Leaving them also preserves you application preferences if you later decide to reinstall the app.)\nApplications like AppCleaner are for purists who want to truly remove every last bit of an app when they uninstall it (nothing against purists, though -- I fall in that camp). Since all these apps mainly do is hunt down these stray plist files, paying for an app like AppZapper is a little ridiculous. AppCleaner is free and gets the job done perfectly.\nAlternatively, the automation app, Hazel, automatically finds related files when you delete an app and asks if you'd like to remove those as well. It's not free, but it is highly useful for a vast number of other purposes, so if you'd like to get the other features it provides, you can kill two birds with one app, as it were.\n\nA: Mac World magazine of August 2010 has this article, they mention several programs to do this, and explain why you should not rely on such programs 100%, but check all files they erase as sometimes they do what they shouldn't. \nLet me check the article again and I will post the recomendations here. \n\nA: Please note that apps installed from the App Store do not require an uninstaller for complete cleanup. To remove them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Launchpad and find the app's icon in there.\n\n*Hold down the Option key.\n\n*Click the \"\u00d7\" button on the app you want to remove and confirm.\n\n\nApps not installed from the store will not have a \"\u00d7\" button, and may require manual intervention (as per the other answers).\n\nA: I recommend to use CleanMyMac. It has a very good uninstall functionality. Besides that it is able to perform other system cleanup tasks. I use it very frequently and am very happy with it.\n\nA: A way to uninstall a program completely even without the use of third-party software, which often causes damage, is by using the custom search function including the system files among the results, you have to search the name of the program and or the vendors\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/470", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "40"}}

Lithium ion batteries don't work like NiCa batteries with memory. If you have it continuously plugged in, charge to 60% and then remove the battery.\n\n\nA: Technically, yes, but from a long-term maintenance standpoint, I would reccommend at least rebooting once a week.  I reboot all my Macs first thing Monday morning, after the Sunday night system maintenance runs, and I never have problems with crashes, memory and the like (unless, of course I do something stupid while programming). Even Mac OS X needs a quick refresh every now and then.\nA laptop is really not that much different from a desktop computer; it's still a hard drive, ram, cpu, keyboard, and mouse just in a compact form factor. Anything you would do with a desktop machine, do with your laptop.\n\nA: From a software standpoint, it's perfectly fine to leave your Mac on continuously. It can even be considered recommended, since Mac OS X has a number of optimization scripts that run on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, but can only do so if the computer is on.\nFrom a hardware standpoint, it depends on your model. If you have an older (pre-2008) MacBook with a removable battery, leaving it on and plugged in continuously will kill the battery quick. In that case, you should remove the battery from the machine, only putting it back in occasionally, charging it to around 60%, to keep it in good working order.\nThe new MacBooks with non-removable batteries are designed to be able to be left plugged in constantly. The battery has circuitry to optimize the charge cycles so that the life of the battery is not adversely degraded over time (more than just normal use causes).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/486", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "14"}}

{"text": "Q: Recommendations for purchasing low cost but Powerful Macs I've started to a lot of video editing with Adobe Premiere CS5 and After Effects CS5. I don't really have the money for a new Mac Pro. I feel that laptops are general underpowered and I have no need to be mobile.\nWhere should I look for low cost Intel Macs that fit my needs? In general, I don't think refurbished Macs from Apple are low cost.\n\nA: How do you feel about a used machine? A one or two year old Mac Pro tower is still a very nice machine for video editing, and you could likely find one on eBay for a fraction of the cost of a brand new one.\n\nA: For a while now I've felt that the best 'bang for buck' that Apple sell is the iMac range. \nThe laptops are wondrous machines but they are expensive and they do top-out in terms of performance at a certain point, and connectivity to other devices can become limited. The Mac Pro/towers are fabulous (I used to have a dual 2.5 G5) but you do pay a lot for that expandability and engineering - a quick look on eBay will show you that both the laptops and the towers can still command near-new prices, especially as Apple owners will often tend to get Applecare, keep the original packaging and use Apple-approved type parts and upgrades.\nThe Mac Mini unfortunately has increased in price as the spec has improved and I now think it's quite an expensive way to get a Mac.\nA second hand Intel iMac, or even a low-end brand new one, gives a good mix of reasonable CPU, upgradeable memory (to a point), plenty of scope for FW800, FW400 and USB external connections as well as a potential internal hard drive upgrade if you get really desperate. It will happily drive an external monitor, something that in my experience people new to Mac don't realise (they think that it's all about the built-in screen and nothing else). \nIt's obviously more of a commodity machine than the towers and that's reflected in the price - you can get an awful lot of iMac for the same kind of price as the entry-level laptop. And if you can find a second-hand or factory-refurbed model, even better!\n\nA: Prices and availability on refurbished Macs directly from Apple vary from day to day (and sometimes hour to hour), and you can often get exceptionally good deals there. For instance, they've currently got a mini for 26% off ($589 versus $799). Yes, some days, there's nothing worth mentioning\u2014but the following day, there might be, so it's worth checking back.\nThe best part of buying Apple refurbs, of course, is that they come with the same full warranty as Apple's brand-new hardware.\n[Whoops, looks like the mini sold out while I was writing this, which kinda proves my point\u2026]\n\nA: Best way to get cheap Macs is from schools that are getting rid of old hardware. Granted most of that hardware is crap.\nIf you're near local schools (or cough eBay) take a gander through anything the photography classes are getting rid of. \nAlso checkout refurbished computers directly from Apple. You mentioned that you don't find these low cost, but 15-20% off (in most cases) is pretty decent.\nIn terms of new computers, I would recommend one of the Mac Mini. It's a stout little machine, and doesn't tie you into a particular monitor.  \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/517", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

Be sure to assign ring tones to your contacts that you want to hear from.\n\nA: Without jailbreaking, your only option is the network operator's (AT&T, Verizon, etc) blacklist option. There may be a monthly fee, $5/mo on AT&T for example, but will allow you block receiving calls from any number you like. iBlacklist will work if your phone is jailbroken, but it costs $11.99 - a little high in my opinion.\n\nA: I was wrong! My other answer was incorrect and has been deleted. There's an app in the App Store called \"Blacklist\" that looks to do exactly what you want.

I want to boot from the SSD and store my /Users folder on the HDD.  I've seen the way that everyone suggest moving an individual account's home folder to a separate partition.\nHowever, I want to move the ENTIRE /Users folder.  I don't want to bother with moving individual user accounts, and I want any new accounts I create to reside on the HDD without any additional steps other than creating the user.\nI already have a complete clone of my /Users directory on a separate partition I created for testing this out.  Is there a safe way (i.e. will not cause any problems with application or OS functionality) to direct OS X to utilize the new /Users folder?\n\nA: I've done this, in fact, I'm using a no-optical MBP right now.\nHere is my experience detailed in full.\nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*I put the SSD in the optical bay, since the HDD bay has vibration dampers and the optical bay solution I bought did not have anything close to what comes in the original HDD bay.  The SSD has no vibration, so it's a good fit there.\n\n*I agree with Fishtoaster... see my link above for how I did it.\n\n*I have bootcamp and rEFIt installed, so when I boot, I get option for SSD Mac, HD Mac, or Windows... works pretty nicely. \n\n\nA: May be able just create a simlink to the /User directory.\nTo do this, open up Terminal and enter:\ncd [SeperateDrivePath*]\nln -s ./Users /Users\n\nYou'll want to move your original Users folder out of the way (rename it or move it or whatever).\n*Where [SeperateDrivePath] is the path to your volume just underneath the cloned /Users folder.  Probably something like /Volumes/Some Hard Drive Name/.  In this case, your clones /Users should exist at/Volumes/Some Hard Drive Name/Users.\n\nA: The best way to do this is probably to setup /Users as an automounted partition, with all your home directories in the root of that partition. I am going to assume you have already copied over the home directories properly (with permissions enabled). Now you just need to add the volume to /etc/fstab. Assuming the parition is named Users, you add a line like this:\nLABEL=Users /Users  hfs rw,auto\n\nInstead of using the volume name you could also use the volumes GUID if you know how to find it, which would be slightly more reliable (it would prevent mishaps if you ever inserted another volume with the name Users. That would looks something like:\nUUID=DF000C7E-AE0C-3B15-B730-DFD2EF15CB91   /Users  hfs rw,auto\n\nYou can find more information in man 5 fstab. Be warned, that manpage is mostly about the programming interface for fstab, but also goes into the file.

This pixel was always lit green, and any attempts to resolve it myself didn't work. I took it back to the retailer, who happily exchanged it for another one (which had to be ordered). I picked up the replacement yesterday, and to my horror, its screen had the same problem, although this time the pixel was stuck on red, and was in the bottom left hand corner of the screen. Another replacement has been ordered, and I'm now a little concerned that this may have the same problem.\nThis obviously has me pondering the quality of the latest range of Macbook Pro laptops, and I'm wondering how many of you may have had the same problems with your ones. Please share if you've had a similar issue.\n\nA: I've had a number of Mac laptops, starting with a PowerBook 100 way back in the dark ages. I've been fortunate, I guess, that I've never had a stuck pixel.\nYou're fortunate that your retailer is working with you, as Apple considers a single stuck pixel to be within acceptable limits. That is, they don't promise zero stuck or dead pixels, so generally you'd just be out of luck. [Worth noting: ISO 13406-2, the standard for flat panel displays (more analysis here)].\nIf you find this happening again, though, you might try one or more of the (non-Windows) suggestions at How to Fix a Stuck Pixel on an LCD Monitor.\n\nA: My experience in Mac tech support over the course of a few years has shown this be be fairly uncommon.  I only ever saw maybe two or three cases.  It may be an issue with the very specific range you're getting now, and which Apple will probably fix pretty soon.\nUntil then, keep sending them in- you've got Applecare for a year, so use it.  :)\n\nA: My Macbook Pro had a malfunctioning backlight so they replaced the top assembly. The screen in the replacement had a couple stuck pixels in the middle of the screen, so they replaced it again. THAT screen had a stuck pixel in the bottom right, which after a couple weeks had changed to a horizontal line of them about an inch long. SOoo, back to Apple I went.\nThe screen I've got now has been perfect, with no bad pixels. I figure between the bench costs and replacement top assemblies they lost money on this machine, but once again Apple showed me they're a class act by not balking at fixing things. \n\nA: It doesn't surprise me that Apple would happily replace your computer, but for LCD screens (maybe LEDs too), it's not uncommon for companies to refuse to replace the screens if the dead pixels are a just a few.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/536", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

Gives you lots of customizability. \nIf you just want the mouse windows resizing behaviour (dragging to the edges) from windows 7, there's Cinch from the same company.\n\nA: There's a nice little app called Divvy, that gives you a lot of control on windows resizing, including keyboard shortcuts similar to ones Win7 has. It's $14, but worth it in my opinion.\n\nA: Shift It\nIf you read this Article I think you get what you want.\n\n\nA: Two excellent, free tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*Spectacle is ultra-simple and lets you setup shortcut keys to all the typical window placement actions (fill left half of screen, fill top half, full screen, center, etc).\n\n*BetterTouchTool is very full featured and can do these keyboard shortcuts as well, but also lets you click and drag windows to \"snap\" to different regions of the screen. (And it has tons of other features, since it's original purpose was custom touchpad gestures).\n\nA: You have a few good alternatives (there are more):\nSizeUp\nOptimal Layout\nSwitche\n\nA: I used open source tool Slate (https://github.com/jigish/slate) for some years but moved recently all my configuration to non free \"Keyboard Maestro\". It's extremely flexible and settings can be edited using a tool instead of editing configuration files. It supports multiple screens and different setups better than anything else if've seen so far. Here's an example of pushing current window to the left half of main screen. \n\n\nA: I was looking for the same thing since window management on Mac is not ideal. I use MondoMouse (15$) for window sizing and control which I even like better than the Windows 7 model.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/557", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "36"}}
{"text": "Q: What does the error \"iTunes could not restore the iPod 'NAME' because the backup could not be saved on the computer.\" mean? My iPod was acting up (the clock was going out of sync, it often became unresponsive to touch) so before contacting Apple I decided to try a Backup & Restore.\nI plugged in my iPod and pressed \"Backup iPod\".  It did it fine, it seemed, and let me know when it was done.  Then I clicked \"Restore\" and after a few of the normal errors (11 and 14) I force-restored it using the Home & Power buttons.\nWhen it was finally restored I selected \"Restore from Backup\" and picked my latest Backup.  That's where the problem starts... it keeps reaching 2/3 of the way done and then this error appears: \n\"iTunes could not restore the iPod 'NAME' because the backup could not be saved on the computer.\"\nThe problem occurs with all of my backups, and persists after a computer restart and after trying a different USB port (just in case.)\nI looked around at several forums and found no one with a similar problem.  The error seems to usually appear for other people when the backup is actually being created, not when the iPod is being restored to a backup like it does in this case.\nI hope this was enough information.  Thanks to any help you guys might be able to give :)\nCheers!\n- Lindsay\n\nA: I hopefully have a solution to this issue. I also had this problem, and I believe it's because you have insuffient disk space and iTunes being a large program requires so much disk space to be available in order to perform these tasks.\nTherefore, iTunes will bring up the error after reaching 2/3 of the way and then the error appears: \"iTunes could not restore the iPod/iphone 'NAME' because the backup could not be saved on the computer.\" The backup you did is there because you're obviously selecting it when \"restoring from backup\". So free up some disk space and redo the \"restore from backup\" and it should complete the process without any errors.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/566", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}
{"text": "Q: Why is my MacBook Pro's screen going black for a second? I have a new MacBook Pro, when I'm using it the screen goes suddenly blank for a second and comes back, it feels like as if someone unplugged my screen and plugged it back immediately.. why does this happen? \nInitially I thought it was only happening when I'm running on battery, but happens even when I'm connected too.\nThis is very sporadic. \n\nA: Clearly, something isn't right. I highly suggest you make an appointment at your nearest Apple Certified repair location or a Genius Bar.\n\nA: If it's less than a second in duration - more a brief flicker than it actually all going black for a second - then I have a similar problem with my MacBook Pro (mid 2009 15\" model). It's very sporadic, but it seems to be related to the computer being under heavy load (eg running 2 large virtual machines simultaneously) when it's running on the integrated graphics (in energy saver, using 'better battery life' instead of 'better performance'). I've never had it happen on the 'better performance' graphics setting, and I suspect it's something to do with the low-power graphics card.\nI do keep meaning to take it to a Genius bar when I get a chance, because it's still under Applecare and it can be annoying (it tends to happen in a flurry of flickers for a minute or two, then nothing for hours on end). However, it's my main work machine and I'm not in a position where I could be without it for a few days, so.... :-)\n\nA: This is an off chance, but I feel it's worth mentioning: this can happen if you have a hot-corner enabled and set to 'Sleep Display'.  I do, and it'll occasionally happen that I'll accidentally move my mouse into the correct corner and my screen will go dark for a second before mouse movement wakes it up again.\nAgain, unlikely that this is your issue, but worth checking before you bring it to an Apple store.  Just take a look in System Preferences (under displays or screen savers or something like that).\n\nA: Take the battery out and connect the MacBook to the power adapter. Turn it on and see if the flicker still occurs.\nI had this problem and it was due to a battery that was going bad. You can also check the status of your battery in the \"Power\" section of the System Profiler. If the cycles are high or it says \"Check battery\" you may need to replace it.\n\nA: I had the same issue. It went back to apple and came back with a new Motherboard. The problem persisted. Took it to the genius bar. Had the display and another Motherboard replaced. I can't say that it's totally fixed... but it's happening much less. Like once a day versus several times an hour.\n\nA: I hope I figured it out. I have no more Black screen issue & flickering since I did below  yesterday:\n\n\n*\n\n*Found advise from a user and Killed process called \"warmd\", process user: unknown.\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/warmd.8.html\n\n*When my Screen went black sporadically, My ipad was connected and nearby my MacBook , I relocated it further away (I read about interference issues)\n\n*I right clicked on battery icon and it showed me that Battery needs Service. I fully re-charged and re-booted my Pro and WoohLah, Battery status was back to normal....\n\n*I switched GPU >> Installed programm called GFXcardstatus (you can Google that)\n\n*In Applications->Utilities->Terminal\nenter: sudo pmset -a lidwake 0   to reverse replace 0 with 1\nenter your computer password...\nThis sends your laptop to sleep on closing but on opening tap any key to wake.

{"text": "Q: LaunchDaemon not recognised I've installed CouchDB via MacPorts. Now I want to start it when my Mac boots, so I executed the instructions given in the install process:\nsudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist\n\nHowever this doesn't seem to work. I've looked inside the LaunchDaemons directory, and the plist file is there (as a symlink):\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   57 18 aug 10:11 org.apache.couchdb.plist -> /opt/local/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist\n\nThe contents of the actual plist file seem ok (however I have no real knowledge of how it should look):\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>org.apache.couchdb</string>\n    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>\n    <dict>\n      <key>HOME</key>\n      <string>~</string>\n\n\n    </dict>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n      <string>/opt/local/bin/couchdb</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>UserName</key>\n    <string>couchdb</string>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/dev/null</string>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/dev/null</string>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <true/>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\n\nWhen I execute /opt/local/bin/couchdb manually, the process is created, so no problems there. It just seems the launch daemon skips this command.\nAny thoughts on how to fix this?\n\nA: Try the following (one-line command) :\nsudo chown -R couchdb:couchdb /opt/local/var/lib/couchdb/ /opt/local/var/log/couchdb/ /opt/local/etc/couchdb/ /opt/local/var/run/couchdb\n\nThen reboot.\nIf it doesn't work, what version of MacPorts and CouchDB do you have ?\n\nA: I'm not specifically familiar with CouchDB, but I see a couple of potential problems with your .plist file: first, the HOME value being set is weird -- it should be a specific folder path (i.e. wherever you put the couchdb user's home folder), not ~.  Second, I suspect you also need to set the PATH environment variable so CouchDB can find the other optional programs you've installed.  So that section of the .plist should look something like this:\n<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>HOME</key>\n    <string>/usr/local/var/lib/couchdb</string>\n    <key>PATH</key>\n    <string>/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin</string>\n</dict>\n\n(Note: the above values are guesses based on a little googling -- you may need to adjust them to where your CouchDB user's home is and/or where your add-on binaries folders are.)  To load the changed .plist file, use:\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist\nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist\n\nIf that doesn't solve the problem, there are a couple of places to look for more info about what's going wrong: first, take a look at the system log (/var/log/system.log), either with the Console utility or a command line tool; it'll have any errors that launchd ran into while trying to process the .plist file or start CouchDB.  Second, follow Mark's suggestion about changing StandardOutPath and StandardErrorPath to real files, and looking at what shows up there.  This isn't needed if everything's configured properly, but can be very useful for finding out what's wrong when there's a problem (and you can switch them back to /dev/null after the problem has been solved).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/590", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: How do I set which Apache / PHP 10.6 should run? All my problems stemmed from trying to get mcrypt for PHP installed. Last night I gave in and followed a tutorial of how to do a totally fresh apache2 and php5.3.3 install. I did this using MacPorts.\nSadly, that didn't enable mcrypt for me last night, although I was pretty pleased that I got 5.3.3 running. :)\nThe problem is that I have woken up this morning to find that my php version is back down to 5.3.1 which can only mean that OS X has reverted to my original Apache and PHP.\nHow to I tell OS X to use the software I installed via MacPorts?\n(And then I will as a new question of how to enable mcrypt)\n\nA: It's not so much your version of Apache/PHP have been reverted - it's just the wrong version is loaded.\nIf you have Mac OS X's Web Sharing enabled it will auto enable the version of Apache and PHP Apple provides using the LaunchDaemon org.apache.httpd.plist in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons (this will override MacPorts version). You'll want to disable this by either turning off Web Sharing in the Sharing Preference Pane or by running sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist.\nWhen you installed Apache for MacPorts it installed a LaunchDaemon into /Library/LaunchDaemons which if enabled will start up the MacPorts version of Apache automatically. To enable it run sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.apache2.plist and you're off to the races.\nIf you're running apachectl to restart - make sure you've selected the right version. You may need to alter your $PATH to have /opt/local/apache2/bim before /usr/sbin\nAs for what version of PHP is being used; on the command line this will depend on your $PATH while for Apache it's entirely in your configuration of where the libphp5 module is. (/etc/apache2/ for the built in version, /opt/local/apache2/conf for the version MacPorts installed)\n\nA: Why does OS X need to know which Apache to use?  Just run the correct Apache yourself.  Open up Terminal, cd to the MacPorts directory containing the correct Apache (probably /opt/something/something/something/Apache2/bin or something like that), and run it (probably something like ./httpd).\n\nA: You have two solutions : \n\n\n*\n\n*You have to edit the global PATH variable to add MacPort folders at the beginning. It contains the order of folders the system uses to find binaries.\n\n*Backup original binaries (in /usr/bin, /bin, \u2026), then add symlinks to MacPorts binaries.\n\n\nNormally, do not use option 2 until you really know what you're doing. I just mentioned it because it's technically possible.\nTo edit the global PATH variable, edit the file /etc/paths, add /opt/local/bin at the beginning and finally reboot to apply changes.\nYou can control, after the reboot, that changes have been made by do the following command : \n\necho $PATH\n\nYou should see /opt/local/bin just before /usr/bin:/bin:\u2026.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/592", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: How Can I Search A Specific Type of File in Mac? Is there any way to search a specific type of file using Spotlight? I remember there was a special command or something that I had to put in front of the search phrase but I cannot remember it now. \nFor example, if I want to search only PDFs for a particular phrase in Spotlight, what would I do?\n\nA: Search by Kind One of the most useful ways to narrow down a search is by using the kind: keyword. This allows you to restrict your list of results to a certain file format. For instance, if you type time machine kind:pdf, Spotlight will pull up only PDF files containing the words \"time\" and \"machine\". You can also limit your search to e-mail messages, music files, System Preferences, applications, and more.\nWhile the original Spotlight recognized only a limited number of file types, the Leopard version can look for files created by specific applications, as well as certain file formats. Searching for kind:mp3 or kind:tiff will find files in one of those formats, and searching for kind:pages or kind:powerpoint will show only documents created in one of those programs. For a list of useful keywords, see \u201cMy Kind of Keyword.\u201d But remember, for the keywords to work, you must have the appropriate categories enabled in Spotlight\u2019s preferences.\nyou can get more info here or here.\n\n\nA: It's already been answered, but here's my 2 cents. \nVia Bash through the terminal\nfind ~ -type f -name '*pdf'\nor\nfind ~ -iname '*pdf'\n(or, if you want to ignore error messages, find ~ -type f -name '*pdf' 2>/dev/null)\nor you can use this to search for a string in a file:\nfind ~ -iname '*txt' | xargs grep 'string you want'\nThis may not return anything on a pdf, but it will work on most other file types (text, php, py, html, etc).\n\nA: mdimport -A \n\nwill give you every possible attribute available on your system\nkMDItemKind is the attribute for files, but perhaps the above will suggest a better attribute to search on. \nThen \nmdfind \"kMDItemKind == 'whatever'\"\n\nThe syntax might make you shout out in disgust.  I can personally attest that it ruins zsh completion.  Still, Spotlight ( that's what this is ) indexes your stuff all the time anyway, and it's fast.  Might as well use it.  YMMV\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge it's not possible via spotlight (tested on Mojave and Monterey). You can only use finder:\n\n*\n\n*Start a search with Command+F.\n\n*Click on the '+' icon on the far side of the taskbar\n\n*Select the type from the 'kind' pull-down menu. Select 'other' and then find 'File extension'\n\nEnter your desired file extension and hit enter.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a Find Window (cmd-f) or do a spotlight search and select \"show all\"\n\n*Hit the little \"+\" icon (to the right of the 'save' button)\n\n*Select File Type as a search criteria and select the correct one.\n\n*Rerun the search.\n\n\n(Disclaimer, I'm not on a Mac right now :( so my exact instructions might be a little off).\n\nA: The question \"How to use Regex with spotlight\" is marked as a duplicate of this for some reason, so I thought I would share how to do wildcard searching.\nYou can do wildcard searching in the Finder using a Kind of \"Raw Query\" with the kMDItemDisplayName attribute:\n\nRaw Queries are essentially what you use with the mdfind command. I have more details on Raw Queries and using them in the GUI at https://superuser.com/a/491119/66255.\n\nA: You can do it with Spotlight too.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Command + Space bar.\n\n*Type period (.) followed by the extension of the file. E.g. for PDF files, type '.pdf'.\n\n*Select the 'Show all in Finder...' in the drop-down results.\nThis helps you even find the file types that are not listed in the Finder menu.\n\nA: We can narrow down the search by using kind:.\nSo, if you want to search only PDFs, you can type kind:pdf.\nAnd sometimes, we don't need to type entire kind, two or three letters may be enough. For example, we can type kind:pd, it will also show PDFs.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/602", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "85"}}

A message appears on the iOS device telling you that copying is in process.\n\n*On the iOS device, in the panel that appears, tap which app should accept the files. You probably want to tap the iBooks item.\n\nDone.\n\nA: Use a file manager and copy the epub to the correct folder. It should be there the next time you open the app.\n\nA: I purchased an item called 'SanDisk Wireless Flash' that now allows me to load or copy from any of my iDevices (pads, phones, etc). It is a small USB device that creates a small area WiFi zone (a few meters at best). First you connect it to your PC and drop whatever data you want on it. Next, you connect to the device through the wireless app on the device and it allows you to see what is on the wireless device and to download what you want: books, pictures, movies, documents, etc. I bought a 32 GB device but there is at least a 64 GB one. \nIt has been wonderful when I want to share data with family and friends. It also helps expand the memory capacity of the iDevice you are using for only a small financial cost. I am completely satisfied with mine.\n\nA: yes there is a way to send ePub files to iBooks without iTunes.\ncopy trans manager ;) will allow u to sync music and books without the itunes hassle\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/611", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "18"}}

{"text": "Q: Can I move an existing iPhoto library to a location on a network-drive so I can use it from multiple apple computers? How do I do that? (including what I need to do to iPhoto on all my apple computers)\nAre there any disadvantages?\n\nA: You can do it, but do it with caution. I've run network home directories before, which is essentially what you're describing, and iPhoto supports it fine. On your standard Desktop OS, simply create alias to the iPhoto library on your network share in your User home directory photos folder. You can also set iPhoto to use a new library in a new location by opening iPhoto with Option (Alt) held down, where it will then prompt you to locate the new library (which would be on your network share).\nThe biggest issue you'll have to address is ensuring it's not open and being edited by two iPhoto instances at the same time. I'm not 100% sure how it will behave, but you can bet not well. You could get situations where photos become orphaned, etc.\n\nA: You should note that iPhoto needs to have the Library sitting on disk formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled). Users with the Library sitting on disks otherwise formatted regularly report issues including, but not limited to, importing, saving edits and sharing the photos.\nRecent versions of iPhoto will not allow you to move or create a library on a NAS.\nWorkaround: Put the library on a Disk Image formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and store that on the NAS\n\nA: To answer your question:~ You should be able to drag the iPhoto Library from the pictures folder in your home directory straight to the networked drive. If it's refusing to do that then you might have to re-check ur permissions from GET INFO.\nIt will be easier for you to share your library by going into iPhoto preferences and and sharing tab, assuming you are using 10.6 Snow Leopard.\n  \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/621", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I show multiple Google calendars in iPhone's calendar app? I setup my iPhone 3GS with iOS 4 to sync with my Google account according to the instructions from Google. Somehow, only the default Google calendar with my name is shown in the Calendar app. What should I do to make ALL my Google calendars appear and sync with my iPhone? Thanks!\n\nA: There is an easy but non-obvious way to do this.\nAssuming you've got Google sync set up, and you can see your one Google Calendar on your phone already, go to https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect (it needs the www; it doesn't have to be on your iPhone). You'll see a list of devices you're syncing. Select your iPhone.\nOn the next screen, you can choose which of your Google Calendars you want to sync with your iPhone. Check the box next to the desired calendars, then hit Done or Save or whatever it says at the bottom. \nOpen iCal on your iPhone, and give it a while to sync, and you now should see all of your selected Google Calendars on your iPhone.\nFor some reason, you can't change the colors of the calendars on the iPhone, so I change the colors in Google Calendar to match what the iPhone picks. \nThere used to be a limit of 5 Google Calendars that you could sync to the phone, but they recently raised the limit to 25.\nThese same instructions apply to the iPad and iPod touch. I've got this set up on all my devices, and it works like a charm.\nThis is documented by Google here: http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=139206\n\nA: I believe you can only do one Google calendar per account to the iPhone.  You can sync multiple Google accounts.\nHere are some instructions, but I was unable to get it to work:\nhttp://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=139206\nIt would be a nice feature to have.\n\nA: You'll need to create a different account on the iPhone for each calendar, but they can all point to your one Google account...\n\n\n*\n\n*You probably already know which calendar is the \"main\" one, as that's the one that the iPhone reads when you add the Google account.  You may have to delete that one from the phone (not from Google, of course) for now because sometimes the phone will complain that \"you already have an account for this set up.\"\n\n*For each non-main calendar, go to the calendar details on the Google Calendar web site and look for the \"ICAL\" icon under the \"Calendar Address\" section.\n\n*Add the account on your phone, then edit the details for that account and enter the address from #2 above as the URL for the calendar.  (Under Advanced Settings)\n\n*Rename the account on the phone accordingly so you know which calendar it is.\n\n*Repeat for each non-main calendar.\n\n*Finally, add the account as normal for the main calendar.\n\n\nIt's a bit of a hack, and I really wish there was better native support for multiple calendars in all kinds of applications/devices that interface with Google Calendar.  But, for now, this has been working really well for me.  It's just a pain to set it up in the first place.\n\nA: Spanning Sync allows you to sychronise with your Gmail Apps or regular Gmail account, and will synchronize both Calendar and Contacts between iCal / Address Book and Gmail / Google Calendar.\nIf you find it useful you can use this code to get a $5 discount on the purchase price HAM46F http://bit.ly/3f3itN\n\nA: from iphone safari browser:\nm.google.com/sync\non the top of the page:\n\"manage devices\"\nselect what kind of calendar you want to sync\nDone\n\nA: I found this buried in Google's CalDAV info after following a rabbit trail.  No need to use Google Sync or create multiple accounts on the iPhone!\nSyncing Multiple Calendars\nBy default only your primary calendar will be synced to your device. You can sync additional calendars by visiting the following page from any web browser:\nhttps://www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect\n(Google Apps users can go to https://www.google.com/calendar/hosted/your_domain/iphoneselect, replacing 'your_domain' with your actual domain name.)\nSelect the calendars you'd like to sync, and click Save. The selected calendars will display on your device at the time of the next sync.\n\nA: I was able to get multiple google calendars to show on the iPhone 4.  I added the first calendar under settings using \"Other Account\" CalDAV and plugging in my google account details.\nWhen I tried to add another account in the same manner the iphone blocked it.\nI then logged into my google account, accessed Calendar Settings for the secondary calendar and found the private URL for ICAL.  I copied this URL and then used skype to text message it to my iphone.  Once the URL popped up on iphone I clicked it.  The phone asked me if I wanted to subscribe to the calendar and I clicked yes.\nBoom!  Two google calendars on my iphone.  One caveat.  The secondary calendar cannot be edited from my iphone.  But this is no problem for me and I am happy.\n\nA: After syncing you may come across calendars not displaying (for whatever reason), despite them showing up on your calendar list in your calendar app.  To remedy this, open Settings.app -> Mail, Contacts, & Calendars -> [your account]. \n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off calendars\n\n*Turn on calendars\nAll your calendars should now show up in the app.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/637", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "17"}}
{"text": "Q: Why is my Macbook Pro getting so slow? On my MacBook Pro (Year 2009) it takes a long time until I'm logged in or until when a program is started. From day to dayit's getting slower. \nPrograms like Safari or Word or MonoDevelop take up to 2 min until it's started.\nWould it be Win95/98/XP, I would reformat and reinstall everything. \nBut what are the possibilites with a Mac and OS X? \nIs there a performance monitor?\nThanks for any hints.\nMy Mac has:\nIntel Core 2 Duo 2.8GHz, 4GB RAM\n\nA: You want to look at /Application/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app.  This will tell you what processes are running and what's taking up the most ram/cpu.  It'll also show you how much ram you're using, how much of your cpu you're using, and how much network and harddrive i/o you're doing.  This is the starting point if you want to troubleshoot performance, since it'll show you where your bottlenecks are and what's slowing you down.\n\nA: First of all, I would start to check your login items.\nOpen System Preferences, go to Accounts, on the left pane, select your account and go on the Login Items tab.\nThere, will be listed all your programs that start up when you log in. Remove everything you don't need to run on your system startup.\n--\nAlso, try to reindex your computer.\nTo do so, either install Alfred (it's an app launcher, but I know it offers an option to reindex Spotlight in one click) or open Spotlight preferences in System Preferences go to the Privacy tab and drag the Volume under which is install Mac OS X, wait a few seconds and remove it. There's also a command line magic you'll probably find in the interwebs.\nBe aware that it might a long time to reindex, depending on the number of files you have. But it could really speed up your system.\n\nA: There could be several things here that are creating the lag time, but there is never a need to reinstall everything.\nPlan A: I actually do these things on the first Monday of every month\nPurge Caches: Macintosh HD/Library/Caches/ and Macintosh HD/Users/UserName/Library/Caches/. You lose some of your application preferences, but things are all but guarenteed to be snappy.\nRepair Permissions with the Disk Utility: You can either view permissions or fix permissions. Just go straight for fixing permissions and get a cup of tea and read a magazine while you wait.\nReboot on a regular basis: I don't care what anybody says about uptime; the occasional reboot does wonders. My Macs are real workhorses, and I reboot Monday mornings when I get in. I rarely, if ever these days, have problems.\nPlan B: The Not So Obvious\nLet Spotlight index when it finds new stuff: Spotlight makes for good searches, but it's indexing processes are a real hassle. If things slow down, I first look for the little dot in the magnifying glass in the menu bar icon. If that's going, I go get a cup of coffee or find something else to do.\nLook for background services you may have forgotten: Also, look for any background processes that may be dragging things down. Look at your login items in the System Preferences, because maybe you have some kind of a server daemon that loads in the background you forgot about. Or maybe you have your iTunes library shared and enough people are on listening to content to slow things down (this was also a problem at my company).\nCheck free hard drive space: I have also noticed in the past that things can slow down if I don't have enough hard drive space. Things really get wonky on my Macs when I have less than 10% free space, so I start cleaning things off when I am at the 20% free space threshold.\nPlan C: System Level\nLook for multiple, related processes: Check Activity Monitor for anything that might be hogging CPU time. Don't just look for a single process that has a high number, but also look multiple processes that might be related. I recently had a problem with McAfee AntiVirus (my company's IT department foisted it onto us) trying to almost continuously scan my iDisk. No process got above 2%, but there were over a half dozen of them. Once I disconnected my iDisk, McAfee was no longer a problem.\nLet overnight processes run: Most days I leave my Macs on all day and all night because there a number of system processes that run at around 2:00a, Sunday mornings being especially important (that's when the weekly and monthly processes run). Do a quick reboot and all should be well.\nPlan Z\nApple Certified Technicians are your friends: Third-party system maintenance software is not. I've been working with Macs for years and the one immutable fact that I have learned is that applications designed to help maintain the system are more trouble than they are worth. When all else fails, take it in because there may be a hardware problem at this point.\n\nA: I had this problem with an old mac.  Make sure your hard drive is fully functional.  Mine had the exact same symptoms, and it turned out that the drive was b0rk3d, and that was why Spotlight took so long , startup took so long etc.  \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/639", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "14"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I set up a virtual machine on my MacBook Pro? Ideally, I'm looking for free or low-cost solutions...  I'd like to test out a variety of operating systems (windows, linux, mac os, etc).\nAny help is appreciated!\n\nA: You basically have three options for Virtualization on Mac OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*The already mentioned (and free) VirtualBox\n\n*The first solution for Mac (and arguably one of the best ones these days) Parallels for Mac\n\n*The very famous VMware Fusion, from VMWare Inc.\n\n\nAny of these will allow you to run a variety of OSs under OS X without resorting to bootcamp or repartitioning. \nThe last two are not free, but -depending upon your needs- vastly superior in terms of features to VirtualBox. I have the three. I have used the three extensively. In its current versions, Parallels is ahead of VMware. But this changes very often with new versions. Virtual Box is ok but slower (to virtualize) and has way less features. \nVMware is very stable. It never crashed in more than three years of daily usage. \nParallels does perform certain tasks faster than VMware, but will occasionally crash the VM. (It happened about 5 times in a two year period).\nIn the end, either will work if you don\u2019t need anything fancy. \n\nA: You could also consider using bootcamp to partition your hard drive to run different operating systems.\nAlthough you need to reboot to switch OS's I find that one advantage is it runs faster since it isn't being run as a program inside the Mac OS.\nYou can also use those same partitions when using Paralles which is a good vm software, however it isn't free.\n\nA: Clearly it's not free, but if you're a professional who NEEDS access to various flavors of operating systems for your daily work, VMware Fusion is absolutely worth every single penny you spend on it. I'm a web developer, and even though most of my work is built in OS X, I'm constantly testing websites and webapps in IE 6-8, and being able to run separate instances of Windows XP and 7 at the same time has saved me so much effort and time that I can't even begin to describe it.\n\nA: You could try VirtualBox.\nFrom its webpage : \nVirtualBox is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).\nPresently, VirtualBox runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh and OpenSolaris hosts and supports a large number of guest operating systems including but not limited to Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7), DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (2.4 and 2.6), Solaris and OpenSolaris, and OpenBSD.\nVirtualBox is being actively developed with frequent releases and has an ever growing list of features, supported guest operating systems and platforms it runs on. VirtualBox is a community effort backed by a dedicated company: everyone is encouraged to contribute while Sun ensures the product always meets professional quality criteria.\nI'm using it since I realise I didn't have to pay for having a good virtualization software on Mac OS X.\nI can tell you it works really well, it's easy to setup and very stable.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/644", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: How long should my MacBook Pro battery last? I have brand new Macbook Pro (15\", i5 2.4GHz, 4Gb RAM) purchased at the end of May 2010 and Apple advertises up to 7 hours of wireless web battery life, however I consistently getting only about 4 hours when I use it normally, i.e. WiFi is turned on and quite a few apps are running, but nothing too resource hungry like games or Photoshop. I tried to figure out if my settings are incorrect or if I'm using some apps that really drain the battery, but can't find any obvious issues, so I wonder what other MBP owners typically get from their batteries? Is 4 hours a typical or I need to replace my battery or do something with my setup? When Apple states up to 8-9 hours, must you turn off all wireless, dim your screen to the minimum and perhaps the only app running be Terminal?\n\nA: I have the MacBook Pro 6,1 (i7, 4GB, 250GB 7200 RPM Drive). \nI get around 6-7 hours when using it for browsing and email. Normal standard stuff. When running Parallels or playing Games I get around 4 hours. Overall I am extremely impressed with the new one's battery life. Watching videos I can push 4 hours out as well, which I do quite often.\nMy old MacBook (Dual Core, 4GB, 5400RPM Drive) still gives me around 3-4 hours battery life after 3 years.\n\nA: I bought my macbook pro in December 2008 and I found that there are 2 main reasons for short battery.\nScreen Brightness and Heavy resource programs (like games/photoshop as you mentioned)\n\nFor example \n\n\n*\n\n*At full brightness I can do simple\nthings like email, AIM, and search\nthe web for about 2 hours of battery\nat full brightness.\n\n*This changes to 3 hours if I put the\nscreen at 1 level above the screen\nback-lighting being off.\n\n\nI found that my battery lasts about 1hr 20min at full brightness when I am working with Adobe After Effects though.\nI would say that your battery life is typical or better compared to both mine and my friends who have the same system.\n\nA: It's likely that you are running something in the background (such as Skype) which is triggering your dedicated graphics card, despite it not actually doing anything graphically intensive. This is a known issue in Apple's graphics card switching technology.\nDownload and run gfxCardStatus and see if I'm right. If so, close the problematic program or use gfxCardStatus to manually switch to the much lower-powered integrated chip. You should get longer battery life after that; I haven't directly measured it but I know I get at least 30 minutes to an hour of extra life.\nAnd of course it also depends on what you're doing with your computer, what background programs are running, the brightness of your screen, etc.\n\nA: Run Activity Monitor and watch the graphs and stats for a while when you are using your machine. Is there a bunch of threads that seem to be 'busy' even though you're not particularly doing anything? Yes? Have a look at the processes that own these threads and see if you're actually using those apps or if they're just wasting your battery.\nHere's an Apple Support article that walks you through the whole thing, with screenshots too.\nI did this and found the two worst culprits were:\n\n\n*\n\n*backupd.\nThis is Time Machine running. Let it run - it is important and eventually stops.\n\n*'Flash Player (Safari Internet Plugin)'.\nEven though I wasn't playing any Flash Video, it seems that some Flash files just burn through CPU because they don't have a proper 'idle' state. My solution to this was to install 'ClickToFlash' plugin for Safari which allows you to control which sites run Flash automatically and which do it on your say-so.\nJust doing (2) doubled my battery life on my MacBook Pro 2,2 as a large proportion of my Mac-time is reading news and articles on the net. Many pages use Flash for advertisements and videos, which we know, but you may not know that many sites use Flash just for the nice fonts that they embed into the file (sIFR text).\n\nA: I have the same model, MacBook Pro 15\" Core i5 (May 2010). I get about little over 6 hours for just web browsing with watching some videos on YouTube and etc. If I don't watch videos I'll probably get 8+ hours. I usually have my brightness set to about 70-80%.\nHere's AnandTech's review of the new MacBook. They also got 8+ hours for light browsing.\nI'm pretty sure Apple's estimate is based on \"light browsing\" which means:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not full brightness. ~60% Probably..\n\n*WiFi on.\n\n*No GPU-intensive apps running (this means no Flash video)\n\n\nTry it and see how many hours you get.\nWith my \"Normal\" usage, I get about 5 hours which is still good in its class.\n\nA: I have a MBP 15\" i5 2010. Eight hours is certainly realistic for light usage.\nThe main battery killers for me have been:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the nVidia graphics unexpectedly. e.g. MagicPrefs for the MagicMouse causes the machine to switch away from the Intel GPU! Install gfxCardStatus so you have an icon in the menu bar that you can monitor and even force the machine down to Intel-only.\n\n*Flash.\n\n*Screen brightness.\n\n*CPU utilisation.\n\n\nFor the past couple of weeks I've been working in a small office away from my usual desk, just writing documents in a wiki and updating a ticket system. Using a wireless network. I recharge the machine overnight and have had a full days usage of 7-8 hours out of the battery every day.\n\nA: I have an early 2011 MBP i7 Intel and I charge and discharge the battery on a daily basis (i.e. charge it to 100%, disconnect mains, use it till it goes down to 5-10%, then charge it again).\nIn doing so, it has rarely given me more than 3 hrs of battery time. \nI have ended up consuming 400 battery cycles in 8 months.\nOn inquiring at various forums, I see that people recommend I should keep power connected to my MBP most times and let it drain only once in a while.  \nI guess I will do that now and see how it improves the battery performance.\n\nA: I had a graphic designer working with me and used his own MacBook Pro in 2010, he claims that he bought his MacBook Pro 3 years prior (that'd be 2007, I guess).\nHe used the MacBook Pro for Photoshop, wireless during working hour, and his MacBook Pro really did last for 6-7 hours.\nBut after I got my MacBook Pro and reading many comments from my MacBook Pro-using friend and over the Internet, seems like we are squeezing the MacBook Pro to just get a little improvement. I guess 7 hours is an historical index and not applicable for newer MacBook Pros.\n\nA: I have mid-2015 MacBook Pro, and if I'm doing light tasks such as writing my essays, and browsing the internet for research purposes, I can expect to get an average of 7 hours. If I'm gaming and playing a graphically intense title such as Bioshock, a session of an hour and a half will drain the battery by 40 percent. I checked Activity Monitor, and the energy output for Bioshock was just over 29. I'm not sure what these numbers represent, whether it be percentage per hour or something. \n\nA: I think Apple calculates 8-9 hours just when you turn your macbook-pro on without wireless or any application running and also no keyboard light and with lowest brightness.\nmy macbookpro keeps battery for average 2 or 2.5 hours.\nyou can find helpful information here.\n\nA: I have a macbook pro from late 2009. Even when I just do word editing and turn wifi off as well as keep my screen at half-brightness, with no other apps running, I can get about four hours at max. Keyboard light and bluetooth are also off. \nOf course I have been using it for about a year now: I got more around 6 hours earlier in 2010.\n\nA: \nI bought my Macbook Pro two months back in March 2018 which was\n  manufactured in 2017. It is a 13.3-inches retina display with i5 2.4GHz and 8GBram and 256GB HDD\n\n. \n\n\n*\n\n*With WiFi always on and screen brightness kept at 50% It gave me 3hrs 20mins MAX\n\n*With WiFi always off and screen brightness kept lower than 50% but continously watching  video or audio in iTunes or VLC player it gave me 5hrs 30mins + a few bonus minutes before the battery turned Red.\n\n*With bit more generous use using it in a dark room with screen only switched on no wifi I will be able to push beyond 6 hours. \n\nHowever, I am living to see that '3rd'one though!\n\nIN NO POSSIBLE way would be able to get to the 7 hours benchmark with it to equal the old Macbook Pros. \nHope this helps! \n\nA: Reset SMC.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295  I bought a new MacBook Pro and it had 4 hours battery life.  This brought it back to normal.\n\nA: Also, I got the  new Macbook Pro 13 inch touch bar as a birthday gift and the battery lasts longer the more I use it. I think the older your battery, the longer it will last. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/648", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "17"}}

I'd like all my calendars reflected here\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The only way I've been able to do this (given that my employer will not allow my iPhone, etc. to connect to Exchange) is to have my primary calendar on my Google Calendar account be my work calendar, use the Google Calendar Sync application on my workstation at the office (always running) to sync from Outlook to Google (it supports only one calendar on Google's side, so whatever it chooses to sync with is your \"primary\" calendar and, thus, your work calendar), and sync my iPhone with my Google Calendars (see here).\nIt's not the most elegant solution, so I really hope someone posts something better that I can implement.  But so far it's working just fine syncing meetings from work to my phone (one way, I believe... never tried to schedule a meeting from the phone).\n\nA: If you're willing to spend some money, you can use Spanning Sync http://spanningsync.com/\nConfigure SS at work to sync iCal with Google (assuming you're using iCal to access Exchange)\nSubscribe to Google calendar(s) on your iPhone (and your home Mac)\n\nA: You can sychronise Exchange calendar to Google then use Spanning Sync which allows you to sychronise with your Gmail Apps or regular Gmail account, and will synchronize both Calendar and Contacts between iCal / Address Book and Gmail / Google Calendar.\nIf you find it useful you can use this code to get a $5 discount on the purchase price HAM46F http://spanningsync.com/?r=HAM46F\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/652", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I unstick my trackpad button? The trackpad button on my 2007 Macbook Pro seems to be sticking.  Specifically, it's stuck in the \"down\" position, which means I'm selecting pretty much everything all the time (you wouldn't believe how frustrating it was just to ask this question).  It was fine yesterday.  What can I do to unstick it?\n\nA: The trackpad getting stuck is also a well known symptom of a bulging battery in the MacBook Pros of this generation. I'm dealing with this issue myself and am very annoyed about it too, because this 2007 Santa Rosa MBP I paid for is essentially the most lemon computer I've ever owned (at least four other hardware failures besides this one).\n\nA: This is going to sound dumb, but have you restarted the Mac? I've had this issue on my Magic Trackpad a couple of times and the only way I was able to cure it was with a simple restart. (At first I thought it might be because I also ran MagicPrefs, but I've since removed that and the problem still occurs sometimes).\nIf you find a restart 'fixes' it, as I have done in the past, then it's possible that it's the software getting confused rather than a physical issue. I haven't found a Terminal invocation yet to restart the mouse driver part of the Mac but I reckon that if I found one I could probably use that to unstick the pad when the problem arises.\n\nA: I had the same exact problem and it was almost unbearable to search for help. I took out the battery but kept my MacBook connected to the adaptor and, go figure, it works like a charm. Time for a new battery! The bulging on my battery is very noticeable. \n\nA: In most models there's a screw directly beneath the trackpad that influences how hard/soft the click should be. If you have the right tools to open it up, you could try turning it a bit to see what happens.\nWhat you can try first is to press down on the button, hold it down, move your finger from left to right a few times and then let it go again. Sometimes this fixes it, but if somethings really broken or worn it probably won't work.\n\nA: I've had an iBook g4 that had this \"Issue\"... it turned out a cookie crumble got stuck in the space between trackpad and case (don't ask). Clicking a few times on different places on the trackpad and some canned air fixed it. Might be worth a try before you pop out the screwdrivers. \n\nA: I had something similar happen to my Macbook pro 2010.  I fixed it by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open system preferences\n\n*Click Trackpad\n\n*Uncheck Tap to click, Dragging, Drag lock, secondary click\n\n\nNot sure if this is the same on a 2007 model.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/662", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}
{"text": "Q: Change Login screen background Is there a way to change the login screen in Snow Leopard?  I do not like the way the purple 'time machine' background looks and can't seem to find anyplace to change this.\n\nA: Tis easy: If you don't mind usig an app skip to the bottom. If you want to do it manually and distrust apps that tinker with your system, continue reading.\nThere are actually two ways:\n1) the way I don't prefer since you may accidentally lose your original background image if you don't back it up\na) change /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg\n - it's that simple!\n2) the way I prefer since it's easy to revert to default: it may look complicated, but all it does is tell the OS to look in a different folder for the desktop picture\n\n\n*\n\n*A \u201csettings\u201d file will be changed. Navigate to \u201c/Library/Preferences/\u201d on the hard drive where OS X is installed. There should be a file named \u201ccom.apple.loginwindow .plist\u201d. Make a copy of the file in the same folder, and name it whatever you want: it is a backup just in case something goes wrong. Once again, administrative rights are required. After that, double-click the original file to open it.\n\n*The file should open in either a property list editor or in a text editor. If it opens in a plist editor, select \u201croot\u201d and click \u201cAdd Child\u201d (or the equivalent, depending on what plist editor). Name the new child \u201cDesktopPicture\u201d, make it type \u201cString\u201d, and set its value to \u201c/Users/Shared/Pictures/LoginBackground/DefaultDesktop.jpg\u201d. Unless you know how to edit plist files using a text editor , I recommend downloading a property list editor (at http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/development_tools/plisteditpro.html)  if you don\u2019t have one, since it makes alot of business alot easier sometimes. Don\u2019t close the application yet.\n\n*The value of the key you just entered above is the path to where your background file will be stored. Change if you would like. Make sure the system can access the folder (meaning that it can\u2019t be a user folder, only shared folder or some other system location). Now, save the plist file. This may require saving onto the desktop and then dragging it into the destination folder, replacing the original. Hopefully you didn\u2019t delete your backup.\n\n*Navigate to the path/value you entered. If the folders don\u2019t exist, create them.\n\n*Now, just move a picture into the folder with the name you specified in the path (in my case/example, it is called \u201cDefaultDesktop.jpg\u201d) and you\u2019re done!\n\n*If OS X can\u2019t use the picture, it will display a generic blue screen. If this happens, make sure the picture is named right, and that permissions (right click -> get info) are set so that \u201ceveryone\u201d has \u201cread & write\u201d permission. If it still doesn\u2019t work, and you want to switch back to default, just replace your edited com.apple.loginwindow.plist with your backup which you hopefully still have. If you deleted your backup, just ask me for the original.\nOf course, to do this non-manaully in Terminal: \nsudo -i\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow \\\nDesktopPicture '/path/to/replacement/image/file.jpg\n\nThere are also multiple free apps out there on the web that let you do this even quicker, including Loginox, NanoCustomizer, etc. etc.\nAs a side note, if you're not administrator, you may be kind of out of luck.\n\nA: you can use loginox it's a free application, and easy to use.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/663", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: iMac screen fogging up I leave my iMac (24') next to the sliding door in the lounge at night. The door remains open, so the air gets very cold at night. When I turn my computer on in the morning the screen fogs up inside, presumable because of the cold air inside warming up quite suddenly from the heat of the LCD.\nIs there an easy fix, or a way to avoid this happening?\n\nA: Consider the operating temperatures of the iMac and see if you\u2019re not going beyond the limits. Electronics cannot (and shouldn\u2019t) be operated beyond temperature limits. As much as heat is bad, extreme cold is not good either. \nAs already suggested, do not expose your iMac to \u201cvery cold air at night\u201d. \n\nA: I have seen this all the time in Minnesota when macs are cold much of the year. The blowers kick up air that condenses on the cold glass - especially at the bottom of the screen. \nAs long as it's not condensing and goes away within minutes - it should be fine. If you are worried, just turn off the Mac and let it adjust to the room temperature and humidity. 30 minutes should be enough. It is rare to see \u201cfog\u201d from a running / warm Mac so smell or observe for smoke or other particulate contaminants like flour or fine electric smoke and evaluate if you need to shut down the Mac and fix the environment first where the Mac draws cooling air or relocate the Mac. \n\nA: I was having a similar issue when bringing my screen in from a colder temp indoors and turning it on immediately. This worked:\nTurn off the display (or shut down the mac if the display is integrated), then leave it for 15-30 mins. The display will defog and get acclimated to the temperature. Then you can safely turn it back on again and it will not fog up. \n\nA: I had condensation building up on the inside of the glass as well. \nI resolved the issue by removing the glass from the aluminum housing and allowing the humid air behind the glass to vent out. The condensation evaporated once it was exposed to the air in the room.\nNOTE: My monitor was warm from being powered on for an hour or so.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/676", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

Released on July 27, 2010, StarCraft II is split into three installments: the base game with the subtitle Wings of Liberty, and two expansion packs, Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void.\n  Set in the 26th century in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy, the game is built around three species: the Terrans, human exiles from Earth; the Zerg, a race of insectoid genetic assimilators; and the Protoss, a species with vast psionic power. Wings of Liberty focuses on the Terrans, while the expansions Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void will focus on the Zerg and Protoss, respectively. The game is set four years after the events of StarCraft: Brood War, and follows the exploits of Jim Raynor as he leads an insurgent group against the autocratic Terran Dominion. The game includes both new and returning characters and locations from the original game.\n\n\nA: Braid\nCertainly the most original platformer I've ever played. Its puzzles and interesting because you also manipulate time, which I've never seen in any other game.\nThe graphics is beautiful, the story is interesting, and the gameplay is fantastic.\n\nA: Plants vs Zombies\nAn addictive tower-defense-like game by Popcap, maker of a few great casual games.\n\nThe game involves a homeowner using many varieties of plants to repel an army of zombies. The homeowner, along with a neighbor called Crazy Dave, must defend the homeowner's house during day or night, in the front yard and the backyard (including the swimming pool), and even on the roof.\n\n\nA: Half-Life 2\n\nBy taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life\u00ae 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors, and even emotions, of both friends and enemies.\nThe player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.\n\nHalf-Life 2 Episode 1\n\nHalf-Life\u00ae 2: Episode One is the first in a series of new adventures created by Valve that extends the Half-Life\u00ae 2 single player experience.\nStepping into the hazard suit of Dr. Gordon Freeman, you face the immediate repercussions of your actions in City 17 and the Citadel. Rejoin Alyx Vance and her robot, Dog, to once again aid the human resistance in their desperate battle against the totalitarian alien menace of the Combine.\nEpisode One exposes Alyx's combat skills and knowledge of City 17 as the player battles side-by-side with her in this 4-6 hour adventure of greater density and detail than non-episodic releases.\n\nHalf-Life 2 Episode 2\n\nHalf-Life\u00ae 2: Episode Two is the second in a trilogy of new games created by Valve that extends the award-winning and best-selling Half-Life\u00ae adventure.\nAs Dr. Gordon Freeman, you were last seen exiting City 17 with Alyx Vance as the Citadel erupted amidst a storm of unknown proportions. In Episode Two, you must battle and race against Combine forces as you traverse the White Forest to deliver a crucial information packet stolen from the Citadel to an enclave of fellow resistance scientists.\nEpisode Two extends the award-winning Half-Life gameplay with unique weapons, vehicles, and newly-spawned creatures.\n\nProbably the best PC saga ever, now on the Mac. I can't believe no-one posted this.\n\nA: Download Steam for Mac and get access to a lot of good games on Mac\n\nA: Neverball\nSince this list is going to be dominated by more gamer-oriented games, I'm gonna be the voice of casual gaming.  Neverball is a great 3d platform game.\n\nThe main gameplay of Neverball is based on moving a ball using gravity by tilting the game world, not directly controlling the ball[2] (it is somewhat similar to the game Labyrinth  without the holes in the middle). The mouse (or a similar pointing device), keyboard, or joystick tilt the level to help guide the ball to a goal, via an obstacle course, with a set time limit. Moving platforms and other crazy objects get in the way, making levels progressively harder.\n\n\nA: X-Moto\n2D Motocycle game with lots of community build levels.\n\nX-Moto is a challenging 2D motocross platform game, where physics plays an all important role in the gameplay. You need to control your bike to its limits, if you want to have a chance to finish the most difficult challenges.\n\nI like playing X-Moto while having a short break. Most of the levels are rather short. It's not a games that takes hours to play - but you could invest some time.\n\nA: Teeworlds\n\nis a free open source fast-paced sidescrolling multiplayer-only computer game. The game features simple cartoon-themed graphics and physics, and relies heavily on classic shooter weaponry and gameplay. The controls are heavily inspired by the First-person shooter genre of computer games. \n\nVery addictive game, it's a 2-D implementation of Quake3\n\nA: Hordes of Orcs\n\nHordes of Orcs is a \u201cTower Defense\u201d\n  game in which you must build walls and\n  lethal towers to defend your village\n  from the Orcs emerging from, what the\n  village elders call, \u201cThe Glowing\n  Portal of Really Bad Things That We\n  Should Have Bricked-Up a Long Time\n  Ago.\u201d Sadly, the Portal is un-bricked\n  and the Orcs are very, very hungry. If\n  20 Orcs make it to your village,\n  you\u2019re toast.\n\n\nA: Freespace 2\n\nThe game continues on the story from Descent: FreeSpace, once again thrusting the player into the role of a pilot fighting against the mysterious aliens, the Shivans. While defending the human race and its alien Vasudan allies, the player also gets involved in putting down a rebellion of those elements of Vasudan (Hammer of Light) and Human (Neo Terran Front) forces which don't want to cooperate with one another.\n\nThe link leads to the Freespace Source Code Project, since the original game was Windows only. Since the source code was released there have been Mac and Linux versions as well as massive improvements to graphics and textures.\nThe community is alive and well with new campaigns and even full conversions in development.\nThe original game content is required in order to play. You can grab it from http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/freespace_2 for ($5.99 at the time of writing). Definitely worth it.\n\nA: Battlefield 2142\nA multiplayer online FPS game. To me one of the best sequel of Battlefield game series. The mode \"Titan\" is really the best game strategy idea of the century.\n\nA: War\u00a7ow\n\nA Free Fast-Paced FPS\nSet in a futuristic cartoon-like world where rocketlauncher-wielding pigs and lasergun-carrying cyberpunks roam the streets, Warsow is a completely free fast-paced first-person shooter (FPS) for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.\nSpeed and movement, that\u2019s what Warsow is all about. Like a true cyberathlete you jump, dash, dodge and walljump your way through the game. Grab those power-ups before your enemy does, plant the bomb before anyone sees you, and steal the enemy\u2019s flag before anyone knows what\u2019s going on!\n\nIt's advanced and complete free and cross-platform Quake 3 alternative.\n\nA: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\n\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive is an online first-person shooter developed by Valve Corporation and Hidden Path Entertainment, who also maintained Counter-Strike: Source after its release. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike franchise, excluding Counter-Strike Neo and Counter-Strike Online. It features classic content, such as old maps, as well as brand new maps, characters and game modes. It supports matchmaking and leaderboards\n   Cross-platform multiplayer was planned between Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and PlayStation 3 players, but was ultimately limited to PC and Mac due to the differences in update frequency between the systems\n   Global Offensive adds new weapons and equipment not seen in previous installments, most notably the Molotov cocktail which temporarily covers a small area in fire, making it impossible to pass through without taking damage\n\n\nA: Give Trine or Trine 2 a try:\n\nTrine and Trine 2 are sidescrolling game of action, puzzles and\n  platforming.\nYou play as one of the Three Heroes who make their way through dangers\n  untold in a fantastical fairytale world.\nPhysics-based puzzles with fire, water, gravity and magic; Wicked\n  Goblins; Climb the tallest trees and towers in the enchanted forest!\n\nThe graphics are truly impressive in both of these games. There is a demo for Trine2 for mac.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/682", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}
{"text": "Q: Great iOS Games \nCommunity Wiki questions can be a great tool for this site, but they require active curation by the person who posted them, and the question needs to be asked in a way that makes the answers more than a list of app names.\nA question about \"awesome\" iOS games that gave criteria for awesomeness, or even a question that prompted its answers to explain not just what the game is, but to explain what makes the game \"awesome\" could be quite useful on this site. While a few of the answers here do that, most are sadly just lists of game titles and (perhaps) descriptions.\nWe're closing this as not constructive. A constructive question could exist that does what this question attempts to do, but it will take careful management that starts with the early stages of the question and continues long after that. -- Daniel\u25c6\n\nDespite being a subjective question, it is a useful one for newcomers to the iOS platform, and serves to aid the gaming community.\nWhat are your favorite iOS games?\nRules:\n\n*\n\n*Limit to one application per answer.\n\n*Add a short description for the application.\n\n*Add a link to the website in the name of the application, if possible (no direct downloads).\n\n*Use ## [game name](link if possible) when citing the game.\n\nOnly iOS games please; there's another question for Mac OS X games.\n\nA: Flight Control\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nFlight Control is a game for the iOS, DSiWare, WiiWare, developed by Firemint and first released for the iOS on March 5, 2009. The app was #1 on the App Store in 19 countries simultaneously on April 6, 2009 and has over 2 million sales.\n\n\n\nA: Cut the Rope\nFairly recent.  Description from Wikipedia:\n\"The object of each of the game's numerous levels is to manoeuver a piece of candy into the mouth of a cartoon monster, and also to pick up up to three stars per level by touching them with the candy. The candy hangs by one or several ropes which the player can cut with a swipe of their finger, and can also be manipulated through other objects such as bellow\"\n\nA: Fieldrunners\nIn my opinion, the best open-field tower defense game on for iOS.  Very clean, well made, not nearly as \"gimmicky\" looking as many of the other tower defense games for iOS.\n\nA: Words with Friends\nSomebody had to mention this... It's like Scrabble, but missing many of the important elements that make the game so great.  The more important part is not the game itself but the chance to casually reconnect with friends.\n\nA: Trainyard\nA Puzzle Solving Game for iPhone.\n\nA: Doodle Jump\nApp Store\nVery simple basic idea (jump ever upward along unending series of plaforms without falling), yet with a constant rhythm and smooth (accelerometer) controls that make the game challenging and addictive.\n\n\nA: Zen Bound\n\nA meditative puzzle game of wrapping\n  rope around wooden sculptures. It is a\n  tactile game, with a focus on making\n  wood and stone look and feel real and\n  believable.\n\n\n\nA: Angry Birds\nIt's pretty addictive ^_^\n\nA: Tilt to Live\nApp Store\nSimple controls can do a lot... you just tilt and move this arrow around and annihilate lots of red dots. It's addicting :D\n\nA: Bloons Tower Defense\nA really great track-style tower defense game, and one of the best ports of a tower defense game from the web to iPhone.\n\nA: Monster Dash\nFrom the makers of Fruit Ninja (which is also awesome)\n\nA: Edge\n\nIsometric world where you control a\n  cube which you safely have to get\n  through the levels. Watch out not\n  falling through the floor.\n\n\nA: Cat Physics\nThe goal of Cat Physics is to successfully direct a ball from one onscreen kitty to another. The layout of each level, placement of the goal cat, and many different obstacles work to prevent you from completing this seemingly simple task. To aid you, moveable arrow icons can be placed in the path of the ball, launching it in the direction of the arrow displayed on each icon. How many arrows are on each level and what direction they point is always fixed (aside from occasional moving arrows), so it's up to you to figure out the best way to utilize them to complete a level. Scoring is based on getting the ball from the starting cat to the receiving cat in as short a distance as possible.\n\nA: Battleground Defense\nA great tower defense game. Awesome graphics and gameplay. Neat maps. Loved the game.\nHere's a trailer.\n\nA: I really need to add GTA here now it has been released!\nGrand Theft Auto III (\u00a32.99 / $4.99)\n10th Year anniversary release, what can I say this runs so well on iOS, at first I thought it would be hard to control, (I find a lot of joystick style games hard to control on touch) but with this all the controls are in the right place, you can tap anywhere to use the joystick. \nI must say, I have wasted hours on this already.\n\n\n\nA: Letterpress\nAwesome asynchronous turn based word game.\n\nA: Ninjatown: Trees of Doom (HD)\nGreat pick-up up an play game where you control a ninja trying to get as high as you can without hitting obstacles. The graphics are very vibrant.\n\nA: Dark Nebula 1 and 2\nMost people are familiar with this type of game.  The basic object is to tilt your device to move your ball from one side of the map to the other.  This game goes way beyond traditional \u201cLabyrinth\u201d games by adding all kinds of obstacles and having huge maps!\n\nA: Sparkle the Game\nSparkle plays like your basic marble shooter; you shoot your orbs at a moving \"train\" of orbs to make a match of three or more of the same color. The main objective is to keep the \"train\" from reaching the hole at the end of the track. How Sparkle differs from others, are its various power-ups and amulets. There are two types of power-ups, destructive and altering. Destructive power-ups use varying methods to destroy orbs and altering power-ups change orbs' colors, slow the \"train\", or make the \"train\" go backwards. Out of the ten or so power-ups, only around half of them are actually useful. There are fifteen amulets to be unlocked, each with their own attributes. Some of these are positive, and some may be considered negative. Amulets are rewarded after completing a set number of levels in Quest mode and can be selected in between levels.\n\nA: Minebyte FREE - Reckless Robot To The Rescue!\nFound this game while searching for arcade style shooter games. It doesn't have that many downloads but it still is fun to play. First few levels are easier, but after sometime it's too hard and challenging to play. It got, I think 50 levels. Dunno why it's not a hit. They've got an iPad version too, in the name of Byteminer, but the iPhone version runs on iPad too, with that 2X button. Although iPad version has better graphics.\n\nA: Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\nFollowing his father's murder, Huang Lee has a simple mission: deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. After being robbed and left to die, he will search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.\n\n\nA: Inotia 3: Children of Carnia\n\nAn unique 2d-rpg gaming experience.\n\nA: Order and Chaos Online\n\nFinally a true real-time, full-3D MMORPG comes to the App Store: Explore a vast heroic fantasy world and join thousands of players in this massively multiplayer online experience that pushes the boundaries of epic!\n\nA: Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP\n\nAs for me, this is the best game I ever played on iOS. Perfect art and music background.\nSuperbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is an exploratory action adventure with an emphasis on audiovisual style. Traverse a mythic little realm, use a sword to do battle & evoke sworcery to solve mystical musical mysteries.\n\nA: Monster Trouble HD\nMaybe the best Tower Defense ever developed for iOS.

{"text": "Q: How can I mount an SMB share from the command line? I would like to mount an SMB network share from the command line (terminal); how would I go about that?\nI am using Mac OS X 10.6.4.\n\nA: What worked for me to make them mount during boot:\n==> /etc/auto_master <==\n#\n# Automounter master map\n#\n+auto_master        # Use directory service\n/net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid\n/home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder\n/Network/Servers    -fstab\n/-          -static\n/-          auto_smb          # add this line <**********\n\n==> /etc/auto_smb <==         # Create this if it doesn't exist <****\n/(not Volumes)/Public   -fstype=smbfs,soft smb://(user):(password)@192.168.140.5/data/Public\n/(not Volumes)/ WGroleau -fstype=smbfs,soft smb://(user):(password)@192.168.140.5/data/Students/wes_groleau\n\nFor some reason, neither the short name nor the FQDN of the server worked, so I used 'ping (name) to get the IP.  In other words, DNS would resolve the name, but mount_smbfs could not.\nAnd I could not put the mount point in /Volumes, because boot up would delete it.\nOne quirk:  After this worked fine for a few days, for two or three days, LibreOffice, Adobe Reader, and Finder could not find ONE of the two shares, but the shell and TextEdit had no problem.  After two or three days of that, it mysteriously started working again.\nIf you do these edits and don't want to reboot, you can mount them with 'auto mount -vc'\nUpdate: More quirks.  (1) There are two WiFi systems here, and one of them has no access to the Windows servers.  A couple of times a week, one or both of the routers goes down.  If the \"good one\" goes down and the MacBook automatically connects to the other one, instead of telling me the drive is off-line, the SMB drivers say \"Too many users.\"  (2) A couple of times a week, I get \"permission denied\" when I try to access my Windows files.  This typically lasts about a half-hour, during which I can go to a windows bar and log in and see files with the same ID and password.\n\nA: I would add that if you have a username of the form \"workgroup\\username\", you should mount it like this :\nmount -t smbfs \"//WORKGROUP;username:password@MACHINENAME/SHARENAME\" /SomeLocalFolderOfChoice\n\nSource : adapting an example from here\n\nA: You should take a look at mount\u2019s help: \nman mount\n\nUpon closer inspection you\u2019ll see that the filesystem\u2019s type is:\nmount -t smbfs //username:password@MACHINENAME/SHARENAME /SomeLocalFolderOfChoice\n\nPassword (and theoretically username) are optional.\nThe result of the above command will be no output (if all went ok), but a cd /SomeLocalFolderOfChoice, should produce the remote results. Please note that SomeLocalFolderofChoice must exist.\nYou can also use mount_smbfs to replace the mount -t smbfs. \n\nA: Using AppleScript is convenient because it stores your passwords in the Keychain.  Bash function:\nfunction mymount\n{\n    osascript <<EOF\nmount volume \"smb://user@fqdn1/volume1\"\nmount volume \"smb://user@fqdn2/volume2\"\nEOF\n}\n\nInvoke \u2018mymount\u2019 from bash, enter passwords via the standard Keychain popup, and if all goes well the requested volumes will be mounted in /Volumes.\n\nA: Use the open(1) command and a URL:\nopen 'smb://username:password@server/share'\n\nPros: Creates the mount point in /Volumes for you.\nCons: Requires the Finder to be running.\n\nA: You could easily achieve this using mount_smbfs (which is, actually, a wrapper for mount -t smbfs) : \nmount_smbfs //user@SERVER/folder ./mntpoint\n\nOptionally, add the workgroup :\nmount_smbfs -W workgroup //user@SERVER/folder ./mntpoint\n\nYou could, of course, change the ./mntpoint (for something like /Volumes/smb).\nAfter doing this, simply go to ./mntpoint to browse your data.\nTo unmount, using the following command : \numount ./mntpoint\n\n\nA: old post but what about mounting like this:\nsmb://no_username:password@MACHINENAME \n\nlike the time machine drives?\n\nA: Important to allow port 445 (TCP) to smb communication. If you don't access it, your firewall block it!\nYou can connect to samba use with the following commands in mac os: mount_smbfs or mount or use GUI see: open Finder click Go and select the Connect to Server menu item, type smb://yourdomain/sharedfoldername and press connect button.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/697", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "148"}}

I've been using OS X for 3 generations of the OS already (Tiger --> Leopard --> SL) but haven't really ventured in using Automator much.\nWhat are the best ways to use Automator? (Best uses, time savers, etc.)\n\nA: I made an automator script that mounted my encrypted sparsebundle and then displayed it in a Finder window.\nI saved it as a service and then access it with a option + command + L.\nIts a quick way to get access to my super sensitive files while still requiring a password.\n\n\nA: I use it to turn the text of web pages, books, essays, etc. into audio files that I can listen to on my iPod.\n\nJust open the text file that you would like to have read to audio in TextEdit (making sure that it is frontmost in the application) and set this thing to running.\nHere are two more related notes: \n\n\n*\n\n*The output is aiff (though the image above shows mp3), and at the point that I last read the Apple Mac OS X terms, and \u2026\n\n*The use of the text-to-speech feature is exclusively limited to personal use.\n\n\nA: Use it to whip up a quick bulk file-renamer:\n\nSee 2 Ways to Batch Rename Files in OS X for a complete walkthrough.\n\nA: I use automator to convert graphics files to PNG format, a task I often need.\nI use Preview.app's action in automator to export file(s) in Finder to PNG.\nIt doesn't require to open Preview and then save the files one-by-one.\n\nA: My DSLR pictures get rejected by craigslist for being to big to upload.  I created a task to easily scale down pictures prior to uploading.  Saves me several minutes every once in a while...\n\nA: Automator helps you automate (pun intended) repetitive actions without requiring programming knowledge.\nThe basic building blocks of Automator are Actions. Each Action does a sigle task, that may take an input and produce an output. Automator lets you create a sequence of Actions, called Workflow. If you are familiar with UNIX it's like a UI for pipes.\nHere is an Automator Workflow I use a lot, especially for downloading lecture notes in PDF from my professors' sites:\n\nCreating Services is another feature I find useful.\nAlso, you can combine the power of AppleScript with the simplicity of Automator with the \"Run AppleScript\" Action.\nAs an example of both techniques, you can check out this service that opens the source of the current Safari page in TextMate.\nIf you need more information about Automator check this Mac 101 article.\nIf you are a developer and want to create new Actions or need more insight into Automator, check out this guide and the Apple's developer documentation.\n\nA: I use it to automatically import photos from the camera uploads folder in dropbox into iPhoto then delete the photo from the dropbox folder.\nBehing this I use appwolf to automatically copy files from my other halfs dropbox camera uploads folder into a shared dropbox photo folder, then have automator run the same iPhoto import script on this shared folder too.\nTime Machine backs up , and added to this automator copies the iPhoto database file to a Windows folder inside parallels desktop, this folder then gets backed up by carbonate backup into the cloud.\nThe result is we never run out of space on dropbox and all our photos are automatically imported into iPhoto from both our phones and backed up by time machine locally, and, should the house burn down/get robbed to the cloud via carbonate.

It's a much easier and more powerful way to work with numbers over a normal calculator. Embed text with your calculations to make it easier to see the problem you are solving. You can easily go back and make a change earlier in the calculation and have everything updated, similar to a spreadsheet. You can use several lines and reference previous lines in your calculations allowing yourself to split up long equations or even reuse parts to see different results.

It fit my needs perfectly, and is really simple & beautifully designed. YMMV, but it's free to try.\nP.S. Elements is a feature-packed alternative with Markdown support and built-in email, but I'm not sure I need those features and it's $4.99.\n\nA: SoundHound\nApp Store\nSoudHound seems a lot faster than Shazam. Will start to try to match a song even before the full capture. It also identified songs that Shazam didn't. And SoundHound's free version allows unlimited matches, while Shazam allows 5 per month.\n\nA: Angry Birds\nApp Store\nThe best game in the app store \n\nA: WhatsApp\nApp Store\nWhatsApp Messenger is a smartphone messaging app which allows you to exchange messages with your friends and contacts without having to pay for SMS.

It allows a user to browse and download applications for a jailbroken iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad.\n\n\nA: Server Remote\nApp Store ($3.99)  \nSimple app to monitor servers, including uptime, running commands, load levels, and memory. Really worth it.\n\nA: Safety Light\nWhen it comes to flashlight apps, you get what you pay for. I've tried a number of these, and the interface and technical capabilities are just right. Much, much better than the free ones. Also, it somehow manages to get the screen super-bright, lighting up an entire room without draining the battery like the new LED-using apps that have flooded the App Store. No battery warning to is this one.\n\nA: Byline\nApp Store ($4.99 / 3.99 \u20ac)\nApp Store (Byline Free) (free; with ads)\nGoogle Reader on the go. Byline will automatically bring you new content, putting thousands of RSS and Atom feeds at your fingertips. Even when you have no internet connection, Byline gives you instant access to complete web pages. It automatically analyses your feeds so that it can cache the ones with truncated content. This means all your news is there in full when you\u2019re offline, and blazing fast to load when you\u2019re online to boot.\n\nA: MoneyBook\nApp Store ($2.99)\nGreat app to track and manage finances.\n\nA: Prizmo for iPhone\nApp Store ($9.99)\nThough it is expensive (compared to other apps that is), this is OCR done right. Works great to capture some texts, quicker than using a scanner and can also be used to import business cards.\n\nA: StreamToMe\nApp Store ($2.99)\nStreams almost any video or music from your Mac or PC to the iPhone and iPad. The Mac/PC is converting the source file on the fly. Playback generally starts after 5 seconds.\n\nA: Profanity\nApp Store ($0.99 / \u00a30.59)\nThe best (and only) profanity generator in the App store. Always useful in the pub. Otherwise completely pointless but great fun.\n\nA: Wikipanion\nApp Store (free)\nProbably the best Wikipedia app in the AppStore. Easy navigation, nice article formatting, very fast.\n\nA: GoodReader for iPhone\nApp Store ($2.99)\nSuper-robust PDF reader with advanced reading, annotating, markup and highlighting capabilities, excellent file manager, TXT file reader and editor, audio/video player, Safari-like viewer for MS Office and iWorks files.\nThis is a great app for any documents organizer and good PDF reader. It also can unzip the zip files, as it's not natively handled by iOS. I use it everyday. It used to sell $0.99, but now they increased price.\n\nA: Snappy\nEnable using the camera from anywhere, even while screen locked. Just configure how to activate it (mine is double tap the lock button) and take photos really, really fast. Also configure the volume button to act as a shutter. It has few more great features such as being able to take one photo after the other really quickly, proper geolocation and camera meta data.\nThis apps is for jailbroken phones only.\n\nA: PCalc\nApp Store ($9.99)\nMy favourite calculator on iOS. The best feature is the optional RPN mode, but it's chockers with other goodies, a very capable tool. I've found it indispensable at university\u2014unfortunately I still have to borrow a graphics calculator for officially invigilated exams, but when there's an in-class test sprung upon me, someone asks me to help them, or even in casual conversation when a question beyond my horrifically meagre arithmetical abilities arises, PCalc is great. It doesn't handle actual graphing, & it still handles statistics in the same horrifically bad way every physical calculator since the old HPs has, but the rest is fine: different notations, bases, button layouts, unit conversions, etc., & the (distressingly un-)usual logarithmic, hyperbolic, trigonometric et al. functions. A dedicated unit from TI, HP or Casio will completely outstrip PCalc but it makes the anaemic built-in calculator look like a child's toy.\n\nA: Anki\nAnki is software to help make it easier to remember things. It uses spaced repetition technology to make sure you only see the items you are having trouble remembering and the things you do remember you see less often. I can't imagine studying without it anymore. In particular it's been a huge help studying languages and I highly recommend it. The iPhone app is a companion to the desktop software and syncs through their servers. The desktop application is free, but if you find it useful the iPhone app is invaluable to studying on the go. \n\nA: WiFi2HiFi\nApp Store (USD $3.99)\nStream Grooveshark, Spotify, Pandora or any other audio player from the computer to the iPhone.  \n\nA: Pastebot\nApp Store ($3.99/\u20ac2.99)\nTogether with its companion Mac application, let's you copy/paste from Mac to iPhone. Really handy. It also keeps clipboard data in your iPhone (example: you can copy an image from a website and keep it in Pastebot)\n\nA: TextExpander\nApp Store ($4.99)\nCreate shorthand strings which expand into more complex statements. For instance, you can create a snippet such that typing ssig expands to\n\nRegards,\nJohn Doe\n123 Sesame St.\nAnywhere, USA 12345\nfoo@bar.com\n\nSnippets can include variable values, and quite a few other niceties. Many popular apps also support TextExpander, a list of which appears here. This is really useful for reducing the amount of typing repetitive or common phrases.\n\nA: Prompt\nApp Store ($7.99)\nAllows you to SSH from any iOS device. I find it indispensable for doing C++ homework.\n\nA: Major League Baseball (MLB.com)\nBetter than reading the sports page.\n\nA: Colorendar\n($0.99)\nSimple calendar app that let's you create a \"color diary.\" Also shows you phases of the moon.\n\nA: OPlayer\nApp Store (\u20ac2,39)\nApp Store, Lite version (Free)\nPlays almost every kind of video format, without having to transcode first. Transfer via iTunes sync or stream right from a web server. There's also an iPad version.\n\nA: Prowl\nApp Store ($2.99)\nThe app itself is ultimately a \"dumb client\" for sending push notifications to your phone. Prowl is a service used to push arbitrary text to you. There are numerous services in the wild for leveraging it to send you NAGIOS and other alerts from monitoring software, Prey Fetcher exists to push posts, @'s, DMs, and list updates to you, and anything else you're capable of dreaming up.\n\nA: Flashcards Deluxe\nApp Store (USD 3.99)\nNot perfect, but possibly the best SRS app on the (U.S.) App Store.\n\nA: Epic Win\nApp Store ($2.99)\nThis is a great app for task management. It's a lot more fun than Things, although not as feature-full it combines a To Do list app with an RPG. Beautifully designed and useful.\n\nA: iGmail\nApp Store (free)\nJust a browser wrapper to use gmail easily and quickly. I find this much better than regular Maill.app - too bad it doesn't have an offline version thus being slow and not as much reliable.\n\nA: Qik\nFirst and best real time video streaming on iPhone. 'nof said.\n\nA: Longitude\n(Available in Cydia; jailbroken only)\nAutomatically feed your location into Google Latitude.\n\nA: Kirikae\nBrings multi-tasking to iOS 3 way before iOS 4 was born. It actually works even better than iOS 4, from my opinion, because it doesn't leave every app open (which can bring batter down quickly) but it does let you configure if you want to do that per app basis. In other words, you can configure which app you want to automatically leave in background.\n\nA: Ninjawords\nApp Store ($1.99)\nA dictionary, to put it simply. It uses definitions from Wiktionary, which I find both more concise & more helpful than those of Dictionary.com, for instance. More importantly though, it's got a fast, lean & intuitive interface. No superfluous features, but I never find myself missing any functionality. It's a joy to use, unlike any other dictionary app I've tried.\n\nA: Textie\nApp Store (free, $1.99 to remove ads)\nTextie provides free messaging between iOS devices a la SMS. If Textie isn't installed on the recipient device, the service will route the message to SMS on many US mobiles, & to email in every other case. Replies are delivered to Textie on the original sending device with push notifications. The icing on the cake is the slick, minimal interface.\nWhatsApp is already on this list, but not only does it not integrate with SMS or email, but I've always found it to have extremely variable latency, from a couple of seconds to two days. Textie's latency has never exceeded twenty seconds for me.\n\nA: ShopShop\nApp Store (free)\nI feel like a bit of a dork for posting this but I find it quite useful and simple.  It's just a list app.  It keeps a repository of all entries you make so you can quickly add them back the next time you need it.  Make a grocery list and check them off.  The next time you won't have to type out items you've already used, just add them to a new list from the remembered items.\n\nA: MobileRSS Pro ~ Google RSS News Reader\nPretty self-explanatory.  An RSS reader for Google Reader.  Simple and well-designed.\n\nA: Boxcar\nApp Store (Free)\nAggregates notifications from various services including Twitter and Facebook; the killer features of this, for me, are its integration with Buzz, which has no built-in iOS notifications, and Growl, allowing me to send notifications from scripts running on my desktop and get them on my iPod Touch.\n\nA: Papers\nApp Store ($14.99)\nTool for managing academic journal articles. Syncs with the Mac App.\n\nA: Site to Phone\nBookmarklet that lets you send the current page in your browser to your mobile device of choice.\n\nA: Age Of Zombies\nApp Store (USD $2.99)\nPure awesome fun.\n\nA: Posterous\nApp Store (free)\nPost to your posterous.com microblog, especially useful for posting pictures and location on-the-go. Similar to twitter feeds, but a bit nicer to view photo galleries for your viewers. It can be set up to auto-publish to twitter, facebook, tumblr, etc.\n\nA: Notebooks\nApp Store ($5.99)\nAnother note taking system. Can also display HTML and RTF files, and you can sort notes into a hierarchy of notebooks.\n\nA: TechNews\nApp Store\nThis is errr... my app, but I couldn't find any rules on this one.\nAnyway, it is a really cool news app about Apple and other related stuff.\n\nA: Grocery IQ\nApp Store\nA great grocery list management app. Can be shared across users - so for example, I can add items at home on my iPad and the list is synchronized to my wife's iPhone while she shops.\n\nA: Twitterific for Twitter\nApp Store\nA great Twitter client for iPhone and iPad. Free/ad version and paid versions available.\n\nA: Zite\nApp Store (free)\nZite is a free personalized magazine for your iPhone that automatically learns what you like and gets smarter every time you use it.\n\nA: Talkatone\nApp Store (free)\nAllows you to make completely free phone calls using your Google Voice account.\n\nA: Opera Mini\nApp Store (free)\nOpera Mini offers the fastest, most cost-efficient web-browsing experience for your iOS device today.\nOf course, if data limits/costs are of no concern, just use Safari for the most beautiful browsing experience on iOS \u2014 but Opera Mini is perfect for travelling abroad, to keep data roaming costs to a minimum, or when you\u2019re stuck with a slow connection.\n\nA: LogMeIn Ignition\nApp Store ($29.99)\nRemote control in which you can see the screen with free subscriptions and desktop versions. iPhone app costs quite a bit, but it's the best remote control for iPhone I've seem, and probably the first too. Works over web or within same intranet wifi.\n\nA: TomTom\nCar navigation with full offline maps for probably every country out there. TomTom is well known for their own car navigation GPS's, but this version for iphone can become very handy from times to times where you don't have one proper device.\n\nA: Zapd\nGreat app to publish entire websites from your iPhone in a few clicks.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/706", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "33"}}
{"text": "Q: How to retrieve windows that have moved 'off-screen' I have this problem sometimes with my dual-screen setup, especially when I'm juggling lots of things around. \nOccasionally I seem to be able to move a window entirely off-screen (I'm not quite sure how) and I can't get it back. If I do a 'hide all' in the application's menu (usually it's Mail.app, so let's stick to that one for the example), everything disappears and Mail seems to think it's got an 'inbox' window in the Windows menu, but there's nothing visible. Closing and restarting the app doesn't seem to help (as the app is helpfully remembering where my window previously was) and all I end up doing is shutting down the Mac, unplugging the second monitor and restarting it, opening the application again and this seems to persuade the Mac to rethink the main window position, and all is well. I can then restart the second monitor, etc.\nIs there a better way? Is there some way of marshalling windows back to a specific monitor, or a utility for moving 'open'/running windows? Am I actually doing something wrong? :-)\nI'm not using Spaces, by the way - so I'm pretty sure this isn't some weird Spaces issue. :-)\n\nA: I have two screens and loading Inkscape usually puts it somewhere inaccessible. I can see it by using \"show all windows\", but if I select it from there it goes and disappears again. The solution I found came from this mailing list comment.\nWhen unplugging the second screen I can see Inkscape. But then even after moving it around a little, if I plug the other screen back in it disappears off the edge again. The solution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the second screen\n\n*Use the mouse to take hold of the title bar of the window (click and hold)\n\n*While still holding on to the title bar, plug the monitor back in\n\n\nA: Chealion answered this on SuperUser.\nI won't copy and paste his answer here, as he got the credit not me.\nBut basically, what you could do is (quoted from Chealion's answer) : \n\nA second method of arranging the Windows so you can see them (if for some reason they're staying off screen) is to change to the\n  application that owns the window in question, hold the Option key down\n  and choose \"Arrange in Front\" from the Window menu. It will then\n  arrange all the windows of that application in a cascade from the top\n  left of the screen.\n\n\nA: I found a really easy fix for this.\nIt happened to me on Powerpoint. I went to the Powerpoint menu at the top of the screen. Clicked \u201cWindow\u201d and then clicked \u201cZoom in Window\u201d. Done\n\nA: Something I tried and it worked for me is switching the resolution to a lower one and then bring it back up. And it just magically puts the application to centre. Cheers.\n\nA: I found this application : WindowWrangler\nIt allows one to use keyboard shortcuts to move the window.\nUnfortunately, it does not work for the only window I need: Inkscape in an XQuartz environment.\n\nA: For specific X11/XQuartz problem, here is a solution I found.\nPre-requisite\nFirst, you will need xdotool. One can install it using brew install xdotool\nThe basics\nYou can move a window to left using the following script:\nxdotool getactivewindow windowmove --relative -- -100 -44\n\n-44 is a value that I believe is the sum of title bar height and menu bar height. If not set here, the window will go down instead of keeping y position.\nFor right move:\nxdotool getactivewindow windowmove --relative -- 100 -44\n\nTo move up :\nxdotool getactivewindow windowmove --relative -- x -100\n\nTo move down :\nxdotool getactivewindow windowmove --relative -- x 100\n\nSo now, you can move the currently selected window (which you could access using Expose by clicking on it if it is off-screen).\n\nYou can then open terminal and repeat the commands until the window appears.\nAccess it via shortcut\nTo make your window move using keyboard shortcut, you can use the explanation given here\nI actually added these shortcut using BetterTouchTool.\n\n*\n\n*BetterTouchPreferences > Keyboard\n\n\n*Add New shortcut\n\n\n*Select Keyboard shortcut textfield and press (e.g.) shift+^+cmd+\u2190\n\n\n*Select Trigger Predefined Action:  Controlling Other Applications > Execute Terminal Command\n\n\n*Enter the command for (e.g.) right move with the complete path to xdotool (you can obtain it using which xdotoolcommand)\n/usr/local/bin/xdotool getactivewindow windowmove --relative -- 100 -44\n\n\n*Click the save button.\nRepeat the same for other directions and enjoy !\n\nA: For completeness:\nFrom my answer originally at Server Fault Question 7237:\nWhen a monitor is unplugged (including the adapter as well if applicable - leaving the adapter leaves OS X thinking the monitor is still plugged in) all the Windows should move onto your main screen. Occasionally some windows (eg. Firefox) will keep their position on the very far right of the screen leaving you just enough room to grab the title bar and move it where you'd like to.\nOne method is before you unplug the external monitor (or before you unplug the dongle) is to open up the Displays Preference Pane in System Preferences and click on the \"Gather Windows\" button. This is supposed to bring every window on the main screen and the option does not appear if you don't have a second monitor plugged in.\nA second method of arranging the Windows so you can see them (if for some reason they're staying off screen) is to change to the application that owns the window in question, hold the Option key down and choose \"Arrange in Front\" from the Window menu. It will then arrange all the windows of that application in a cascade from the top left of the screen.\nLastly, there are several AppleScripts available (eg. this one at Snipplr) that will also grab every window off screen and move it on screen for you.\nThere is also a nifty shareware app called Stay that will help automate a lot of this for you, while there is also MarcoPolo which will do much more than just notice if a monitor is disconnected and allows you to run scripts (in case you want to do more than just rearrange the windows).\n\nA: Also, for completeness, I came across this: Stay app for Mac although I haven't tried it or bought it yet.\nFrom their website:\n\nStay can store a set of windows for every combination of displays that you use with your computer. For example, if you have a laptop that is sometimes connected to an external monitor, you can store two sets of windows in Stay; one with the external monitor connected and one without. This done, you\u2019ll be able to ensure that your windows are always where you want them to be by having Stay restore windows whenever you connect or disconnect the external monitor. Stay can even be configured to automatically restore windows as displays are connected and disconnected.\n\n\nA: I have a solution that worked for me and I trawled forums and tried everything I could possible.\nIn the end I found a way. Install an app called BetterTouchTool. This allows you to make a shortcut to do various handy things with your screen etc. Then setup an app specific shortcut (much easier than it sounds), and make it simple. I set it so that a \"two finger swipe- up\" led to a \"Maximise window\" action. This stuck the missing application on to my laptop screen and away from the phantom monitor screen it had been stuck on.\nProblem solved.\nHere's an image of what BetterTouchTool looked like when I'd set the shortcut up:\n\n\nA: I just had this same problem in Mavericks, I managed to solve the problem by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take the pointer to an edge of the window that moved off screen, for example to the edge on the right.\n\n*When you see the resize icon (in my case the horizontal resize icon) click and hold.\n\n*While \"holding down the click\" drag the window. Voila!\n\n\nA: A friend of mine  wrote a free tool for bringing back the windows, if you want to check it out, go here: http://bring-em-back.com\n\nA: It seems that this happens to me most often when the secondary display is \"above\" (in System Preferences -> Display -> Arrangement). When the problem happens if I move the external display \"to the right\" then the X11 windows reappear.\n\nA: In El Capitan the simple answers here didn't work for me or weren't available as options.  What did work was to right-click the app in the Dock (Chrome in my case) and select Options > Assign to Desktop on Display 1.

Many of the solutions here do not work for XQuartz.  From this ticket: https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/796 , I've found two solutions that work and I feel it would be beneficial to state them here.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you can unplug/plug-in your monitor easily, then unplug your monitor so that your window appears in a spot that you can access.  Then, with your mouse, click on the window and hold down the mouse button as if you are going to drag it.  Without letting go of your mouse or the window, plug in your monitor.  The XQuartz window should stay where your mouse is.\n\n*This ShiftIt package works very well for getting windows that have disappeared off-screen: https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt/downloads\nThere may be other similar packages, but this one is clean and effective.\nHope this helps someone!\n\nA: A bit weird though that a window (Terminal in my case) got lost in the arrangement.

The document is opened, its just way off to the left, off-screen of all displays. You can\u2019t fix this with Applescript: XQuartz doesn\u2019t implement the standard scriptability verbs to get and set the position of windows. It also doesn\u2019t implement the standard X11 window manager equivalents.\nThe problem\u2019s cause is a conflict between a preference setting in Inkscape and a preference setting in Mavericks.\nThe out-of-the-box preference setting for Mavericks in System Preferences > Mission Control is\n[x] Displays have separate Spaces\nThe out-of-the-box preference setting for Inkscape in its menu bar File > Inkscape Preferences > Windows is\n(\u2022) Save and restore window geometry for each document.\nIf you change the OS X preference (requires Logging out, and Logging back in), or you change the Inkscape preference to (\u2022) Don\u2019t save window Geometry (Which you can\u2019t do unless you can get Inkscape to show you a window) the Inkscape performs as expected.\nSo, if you want Mavericks' new behavior with multiple displays on your Mac, then temporarily revert to the old way, change an Inkscape preference, then set Mavericks back to a menu bar on each screen.\n\nA: Under the application's menu item 'Window', select \"Arrange All\".

{"text": "Q: Is an iPhone call recorder theoretically possible? NOTE: I know neither the iPhone SDK or Objective C, just wondering if possible.\nI know obviously it would have to be on a Jailbroken device anyway, but it is technically possible for a iPhone call recording application to be made, or is it not possible to hook into the calls or the audio input/output?\nI know obviously there would be no 'official' way of doing it and certainly not from an App Store application. And I know there are call recording apps which place outgoing calls through their own servers.\nJust wondering if the reason it doesn't exist yet is just because no-one has coded it or if it's not actually possible?\n\nA: On Jailbroken iPhones, SpoofApp does call recording. I am not a laywer, but note that recording calls may not be legal depending on where you are and/or where the other party is.\n\nA: For the UK market there is also Call Recorder . It uses a premium rate number to record the call but it's available for non jailbroken iphones too.\n\nA: Just recently I discovered an app actually able to do it properly, but just for SIP calls.\nIt's called MobileVOIP and it's on Apple Store! :D\nSo I hope this does answer your question. Even if it's not recording a phone call, I believe it shows it's theoretically possible.\n\nA: There is no easy way since that part of the software and hardware is secured. \nOf course it's possible in the theoretical sense as the voice recorder and music mixing apps show the power of signal processing hardware and software has access to both streams of sound. \nSomeone would need to re-do some or all of the iOS code and change it. But what's simple in concept is surely complex and perhaps too costly to happen in reality. \nYou simply take the code that listens to the stream of microphone data inside the mobile Phone app and dump a file to storage as well as encoding it for voice calling. If that app calls an API rather than doing that processing itself, then you would implement the recording there. You would do the same for the incoming data and could either add time markers for later mixing or mix it down as the call is being handled.\nThis code is of course not in place using the documented API so you would need to patch the app after a jailbreak or uncover an undocumented API to actually implement this feature.\nThe use case is so obvious that if this were sitting there, hundreds of apps would be doing this already.\n\nA: iOS Tweak Developer Elias Limneos has released an app on Cydia called Audio Recorder (originally called Call Recorder).  \nSo it's finally possible to record calls locally on the device without having to call via premium rate numbers!\nAudio beeps can be disabled but there is a forced 'This Call is being Recorded' message played at the start to the other party.\nIt currently only works with the iPhone 4S (Loudspeaker only) and iPhone 5 and a license costs $3.99 per device.\nEDIT - Looks like I was too slow, since I purchased this last week it has already been discontinued although existing purchasers can continue to use it there will be no further updates.\n\nI, Elias Limneos. sadly announce that I decided to stop distributing and working on \"Audio Recorder\" application.\n    As of today, Audio Recorder is discontinued.\n\nSource:  http://limneos.net/audiorecorder.html\nEDIT - He's changed his mind again and is available for sale via his own Cydia repo.\n\nA: It's definitely possible, and almost certainly unnecessary to read directly from memory. Apple's private APIs are discoverable using both Xcode and certain 3rd party Objective-C class browsers.\nIf you need your unasked question answered (\"How would one implement an iPhone call recorder?\"), Then I agree with Josh K: head over to stackoverflow.com. Or get in touch with the folks at Rogue Amoeba, as they've already solved this problem on Mac OS X, which shares the exact same low-level libraries as iOS.\n\nA: Yes it's clearly possible at least by reading directly in the memory even if hook is probably much easier to do.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/731", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "9"}}
{"text": "Q: Can I set the stereo Bluetooth profile as the default, or remove the mono profile?  Whenever I turn on my Nokia bluetooth headphones they automatically connect to my Macbook. The problem is they always connect to the Mono (and not the Stereo) profile. So I have to disconnect and reconnect with the stereo profile. Is there anyway to either delete the mono profile or set the stereo profile as the default?\nMac OS X 10.6 Nokia BH-905\n\nA: Since no-one has stepped up with an answer, I'm going to add a few things that may help get you (or someone else) closer to an answer.\nIn a nutshell, your question is about HSP - the mono headset profile and A2DP - the stereo profile.\nHSP was designed for two way, low latency (delay) audio - designed for the limited spectrum telephone lines send for human voice frequencies. It sacrifices sound quality needed to make stereo music sound good.\nA2DP is all about better quality and allowing different encoding schemes to get the best music over a bluetooth link (with potential interference) and sacrifices two way audio, microphone, and adds delay to queue up enough music to allow playing over momentary interference or pauses in bluetooth.\nYour headset speaks both - so if you could get your headset to only advertise A2DP, the mac would be forced into stereo. I don't think it's possible, but you might see if Nokia allows you to control this.\nEven if you were willing to give up HSP completely on the mac, I don't know if you can delete the driver files and re-program the bluetooth board to not negotiate HSP with your headset.\nI do know you can use the Bluetooth Explorer (part of Xcode 3) to systematically clear the preferences and play around with things to see if you can really remove all records of the mono pairing. Whether you could edit the profile to delete HSP from the pairing record is hard to know unless you wanted to experiment and learn in depth how this was engineered.\n\nSome things that will help you track the settings are in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist and /Library/Preferences/Audio as well as using the option key while pressing the mouse on the bluetooth menu to expose the \nbluetooth link address of each device so you can match the plist files to actual devices. (Or get the developer tools and use Bluetooth Explorer)\nLastly, you might run the Bluetooth diagnostic utility to see if interference with other devices might be causing your mac to systematically choose HSP which is more nimble than A2DP.\nGood luck - I don't have a device with both A2DP and HSP to test, but I can tell you that my A2DP device is by far the worst when it comes to the % of time it fails to connect. (Which is the point where you choose whether to connect as mono or stereo) I usually need three connect attempts to get it working and I'm in a very low noise environment. It works really well once paired - just hard to connect.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/738", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "14"}}
{"text": "Q: Is there a better way to travel internationally with an iPhone (3GS/4 specifically)? I've travelled to Europe and Asia quite a bit with iPhones with no problems (I live in the US), except for the fact that making calls anywhere outside the US is crazy expensive and of course I wouldn't dare turn on data roaming for fear of the thousand-dollar bill.\nThese days, though, is there not a better way? Can I not go into a shop in the UK and buy a pay-as-you-go micro-sim for 30GBP and call/data away? Is my iPhone (3GS and 4) permanently and forever locked to AT&T unless I jailbreak it, even with a different sim card?\nI'm willing to jailbreak my 3GS to accomplish this mission, but I'd like to hear from someone with real-world experience before doing so.\nThanks!\n\nA: As you've pointed out, US iPhones are locked to AT&T. Fundamentally, that's your only real issue here. If you can unlock your iPhone, then your suggesting of just picking up a micro-sim and using it for data and calls works perfectly. In the UK, we can buy iPhones unlocked, and get our network operators to unlock them.\nWhat you described is exactly what I've done when travelling abroad, but it's entirely reliant on having an unlocked device to start with. From there, you should be good to go. In the UK, there's a massive range of low-cost, pay as you SIM only options to choose from. O2 do a big range of SIM only deals, including micro-sim plans (see here).\nThe other option to consider is, if you're looking to upgrade to an iPhone 4 anytime soon, buy it abroad, from the UK, unlocked, and then you won't have to jailbreak it in the future. UK and European iPhone models will work perfectly well in the US, and they come with a global warranty as well.\n\nA: Yes your iPhone is locked on AT&T, you must jailbreak & unlock it if you want to use another sim. If you only travel to UK, you might take a pay-as-you-go sim. If you travel in many country in europe you might be interested by http://www.callineurope.com/. It might even be interesting if you only go to UK has there is a special UK pass.\n\nA: I traveled to South America last summer and just for that trip, signed up to an AT&T International calling plan that included both phone calls and text messaging. I didn't use my phone a lot (in 2 weeks in Peru and Ecuador) so I only spent about $25, but the text messaging turned out to be critical during a two-day medical emergency involving a family member.   I turned the plan off as soon as I got home.  \nRecently I went to Asia and just set up the texting plan for $10/month and used it for just one month.  (No phone calls.)\nWill something like that work for your for Europe and Asia?  (That is: buy something temporary from US AT&T, focusing just on your upcoming trip, and then shut it off when you get home.)\n\nA: If you are looking for a truly global answer - this article is updated to let you know which carriers allow an authorized unlock.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1937\nIf your phone is locked on a carrier that will unlock it, simply see what the price and procedure is to get it unlocked. Only you and apple will know the status of your phone. If you have a used phone, any service rep can look up your serial number and let you know the status of that device in the iPhone device activation database.\nIf you can't or won't unlock a locked device - then it's a cat and mouse game to get it unlocked. The details depend on the exact version of iOS software and modem firmware on your phone. If you restore your phone - the unlock can get undone. It's not impossible to do, but it's technically tricky and you'll need to get someone to help you or learn the ropes. Do consider if the phone has a problem on the road - you may need a computer to re-unlock it so be prepared to rent a handset if you don't travel with the tools and knowledge to perform another unlock yourself.\nOnly you can determine if the hassle factor of unlocking your phone outweighs the price of buying one that is authorized to be unlocked.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/741", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}
{"text": "Q: Should I stick with programming on my Apple or switch to Linux? I was wondering whether or not the switch to Linux would be worth it.  I feel like programming on my MacBook Pro is fine and I was wondering what the advantages would be for staying or switching.\nWhat would you do and why?\n\nA: Considering OS X is a POSIX compliant unix system, you can do most of yout *nix programming on OS X anyway.\nI would stick with Apple, it is a growing market and has some very good tools to help you along the way.\n\nA: I program for both Mac OS X and Linux, and I agree with bromfiets - try both of them!\nAs somebody else has suggested, put a VM on your Mac and load up Ubuntu and give it a whirl. I do some of my Linux work that way, using VMWare on a Mac Pro. (I also program on a MacBook with Snow Leopard, and a Sony laptop that runs Ubuntu.)\nUser322 is quite wrong about how \"effectively no difference between programming on a Mac or a Linux box\". If you want to write GUI programs on a Mac, your best bet these days is to use Cocoa and Objective C, and on most Linux distros it's C with GTK+. (Most of the others others, you'd use C and KDE, and on a few, C++ and Qt.) The graphics and window management systems are radically different... I could go on and on.\nOn Linux, if you don't like how some component operates, you can dig into the sources and fix them, which is usually not an option on the Mac. You learn a lot, and you can make pretty good money doing that! My day jobs during much of the last five years have involved mucking around with the internals of Linux components like the X server, GTK+, and Clutter, and I now turn down work doing that these days because there's so much demand and I'm overloaded.\nApple really pushes the use of Xcode on the Mac for both editing and builds, and it's pretty good. On Linux, there's no real standard. For editing, you've got various GUI tools (kate, gedit) and terminal-based editors (vi/vim, emacs). For builds, you can do the command-line make thing, or use jam, or ant. Or you can go with an IDE like Eclipse, which is about as close as you'll find to Xcode, and in some ways is better. You get most of these tools for your Mac, but hardly anybody uses them there.\nMac and Linux programming are really different worlds, and both of them are pretty cool.\nAnd while I like the Mac as a user... having attended WWDC off and on since the mid-80s, and also attended various Linux-oriented tech conferences like GUADEC and the Ottawa Linux Symposium... I'd attend the Linux ones over WWDC every time. They're just hackers' dreams, tons of fun, and they make the marketers stay away.\n\nA: That depends on what your problems are with your mac and whether Linux solves them.  Gotta give more detail than that, man.\nPersonally, I love my mac for development for a few reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Window management is great.  At work I have two decent monitors, but when I'm coding on my little 15\" MBP, having cmd-tab/cmd-` is great and Expos\u00e9 is a godsend.\n\n*I have a real unix command prompt to use for dev tasks, but still a user friendly system for more normal activities.  I feel OS X has a good balance between the strengths of Linux and Windows without the need to switch between the two.\n\n*Apple is a well-supported system.  It's disadvantage is that at some levels, it can be difficult to customize it (in both hardware and software).  The upshot of that is that if something goes wrong, you have a huge community of developers and users using very similar setups, whereas with Linux has both a smaller and less homogeneous userbase.\n\n*The mainstream mac development apps (Textmate comes to mind) tend to be better designed and more usable than their Linux counterparts.  Some would argue that this comes at the cost of power and control- however, most popular Linux apps can be run on OS X one way or another.\n\n*Edit addition: Two-finger swipe scrolling.  Never realized how useful this was until I had to code for 6 months on a Thinkpad.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Though I interact with *nix systems all the time, I've never used Linux extensively on the desktop.\n\nA: I suggest to not switch, but use both OS X and Linux. You will get more experience and learn to program in more than one \"environment\". Similary, don't stick to one single programming language. Try another one (at least).\n\nA: Since OS X is unix-based, there's effectively no difference between programming on a Mac or a Linux box. It boils down simply to what programs and utilities (text editors, database frontends, etc) you prefer. But the Mac has infinitely better programs in this sense (at least in my humble opinion), and what utilities Linux does have are generally available on the Mac as well. Long and short, the only good reason to program on a Linux box when you have a Mac available is when you're developing an application for Linux. For everything else, just stick with your Mac.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/750", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

I accidentally deleted my \"var/keychains\" folder in my jailbroken iPhone 4 thinking that it would solve a problem to a tweak that wasn't work, and now my iPhone is not recognizing the passwords I enter into the phone. It keep asking me to enter my voicemail password, email passwords..etc. I can't even access youtube. I also can't sync my iPhone 4 to my iTunes because there aren't any valid files in the Keychains folder. I have recreated the folder, but I did not back up any of the files in it. I was suspecting that the iPhone would recreate those files once I deleted them, but I was wrong. Can anyone help me out here? I can't restore my iPhone because I haven't backed up any of my important data. I can still use the iPhone, but these inquiries are irritating me hugely.\n\nA: You are probably in pretty bad shape here, the system keychains are generally created as part of the iPhone's activation process (they include things like the APNS certificate, which is negotiated with Apple during activation). Even if you do manage to create a new keychain, all the certs on it will be different, which means that anything that has exchanged keys with your iPhone (like push notifications, encrypted backups, etc) won't work.\nYou might be able to create an empty keychain by using the security commandline tool. I am not sure if that is actually installed on the iPhone by default. You might also be able to create an empty toolchain on a Mac and copy it over, but I am not sure if the iPhone keychain is format compatible with the Mac OS X one.\nI think it is important to remind people, if you don't know exactly what you are doing then mucking with system files can be very dangerous, and you should always make sure you copy the original files so you can revert it.\n\nA: I don't know if this will work for a jailbroken phone.*\nIf your iTunes back up of your iPhone is not encrypted then it will not back up your keychain. You should be able to disable encryption, then do a back up. A restore from this point should create a new keychain for you.\n*Don't blame me if you lose all your data.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/762", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: iPhone stuck at \"No SIM card installed\" I \"retired\" my old iPhone 3GS when I got my shiny new iPhone 4 and I was happily using it as an iPod touch with camera and compass.\nHowever, I made the mistake of throwing away the SIM inside the 3GS, because I wanted to permanently disable any phone functions, and make sure I didn't have to turn on airplane mode or anything silly like that.\nWell, that seemingly worked fine until iTunes upgraded the 3GS to iOS 4.0.2. Now the sim-less iPhone 3GS is stuck at ...\n\nNo SIM card installed\n  Insert an unlocked and valid SIM to activate iPhone\n\n\nWhat sucks is that I can't figure out any way to get around this!\nApparently, based on the (excellent) How to Activate a Used iPhone the only way around it is to either\n\n\n*\n\n*Jailbreak\n\n*Get an AT&T sim, somehow\n\n\nI tried to Jailbreak but I was nowhere near smart enough to navigate the maze of twisty passages involved in jailbreaking this 3gs. iBoot too new? ipsw not recognized? ... what?\nI feel like an idiot now because apparently an AT&T sim is REQUIRED to make an iPhone work even if you have no intention of ever using it as a phone? Is that true? How can you get around this \"No SIM card\" issue?\n\nA: I bought an old, used AT&T sim card from eBay for $4, inserted it into the phone, and that worked fine -- now the phone can be upgraded to new iOS revision, even though I never plan to use it as a phone ever again.\nAs I learned the hard way: do not remove and throw away the AT&T sims from your old iPhones, no matter what!\n\nA: Try this:\n\nInstead of telling everyone who hasn\u2019t got the original sim that activation of the iphone is easy using a phonebook sim card, i made this video to show you all how it works , Use any phonebook sim card, they are there in Radio Shack, mobile phone shops or any mobile tech stores. Any phone book simcard will do the trick, no need for programmable sims, all those phonebook sims used to save your contacts and transfer them have a universal ICCIDs preprogrammed so they all work.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA1bb9C7vNU\n(Note: Though the page has info about jailbreaking, this maneuver does not require you to j/b your phone.)\n\nA: This is, unfortunately, expected behavior. Whenever you activate an iPhone (which you do as part of an OS install) it talks to Apple's servers and does various things like exchange crypto certs for APNS, etc. It also checks the IMEI of the phone to see what carrier Apple sold it to, and validates the SIM is valid for that carrier (if you buy an unlocked iPhone in a country where you can buy either locked or unlocked phones the vendor will actually copy down the IMEI number of a normal locked phone, and then enter in their system where it gets pushed to Apple's servers as an unlocked phone, there is no physical or configuration difference on the phones).\nThe easiest way to get it activated is (as you surmised) to use an AT&T SIM. You mentioned you have an iPhone 4, you can activate it with that SIM. There are plenty of companies that sell microSIM to SIM adapters, but if you want to do it right now you can just place the micro SIM directly in the iPhones 3GS's SIM try with tape. I would not recommend doing this on a device you intend to keep the SIM in for a an extended period because the SIM is likely to come loose (and jam the SIM tray), but if you are just inserting it, activating it, and removing it you should be fine so long as you are pretty careful with how you apply the tape and not shaking the phone too much.\n\n\nA: I suspect you could ask AT&T for a duplicate of your old SIM card, the one you had thrown away.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/764", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "15"}}

{"text": "Q: Should I use a network-attached Time Capsule or a USB external drive with my MacBook Air? I love Macbook Air, but disk space is a real issue. This is most obvious when using it as main machine - media from iTunes and iPhoto in particular ends up leaving you with very little working space. How do you approach this problem?\nHow workable is it to keep this data on a Time Capsule shared drive? I can imagine initial performance when moving large amounts of songs etc. is quite poor, but how is it after that? Is, say, adding a batch of photos or incremental backup/sync of an iPhone noticeable?\nA simple external drive attached via USB would seem the other obvious option. Or, perhaps the Air is simply never intended as a main machine - mobility is the key. In this case, do you temporarily dump media to it on-the-move and then move to your desktop when you get home?\n\nA: it generally depends on being constantly connected (be it ethernet, wifi or some sort of 3g dongle) or not.\nultramobile and having the data everywhere where you have an internet connection: I personally have tried to host my 80gb itunes collection on a jungledisk (powered by amazon s3) and I can only say it's cumbersome. e.g.: you download new podcasts and end up re-uploading them to your s3 storage.\nultramobile and all your data at home on your network (e.g. time capsule or some sort of network attached storage): also did this for a while, no hickups, works great via 802.11g although I'd recommend 802.11n if you're likely to watch HD videos straight from your NAS/Time capsule.\nultramobile and all your data always with you: that's the approach I'm currently using, I have a 500g usb2 drive I carry in my notebook bag containing my itunes library and assorted other data (iphoto library and what not) that doesn't fit on the internal drive. \nIt's my favorite solution as I have my data on me even if there is no internet connection available.\ncheers\nflorian\n\nA: Florian\u2019s answer covers basically all the scenarios. You can, however, have a mix between option 2 and 3. \nSome programs (notably iPhoto and iTunes) allow you to select different libraries upon startup. \nIf you press Alt when starting, it will prompt for your library. You can then, have two libraries, one at \u201chome\u201d with all your stuff that you use when you are home and connected (to a big external drive for example), and other small library, locally stored on your Macbook Air. \nThis is not the best of the methods as it requires you to remember to switch libraries (tho nothing bad happens if you forget) and it also has the problem of \u201cduplicating\u201d certain data. I.e.: all the music you want to carry, you have to copy twice, one to your big library and other to the \u201cmobile\u201d library. \nRegarding Pictures, unless you always want to carry them all with you at all times, it\u2019s best to use any online service to store them and keep only the \u201cmost important\u201d in your iPhoto, or the ones you haven\u2019t yet processed. \nFInally, as you have correctly stated, the Macbook Air can serve as a main computer, however, its connectivity and hardware limitations clearly indicate that despite the above, the machine is more aimed at portability than anything else. \nLast but not least, you can always upgrade the internal hard-drive of your Macbook Air, and although it could prove to be an expensive solution, SSD drivers higher than 256MB are already available and of course normal magnetic drives go way further than that (for a fraction of the price of an SSD). \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/773", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

I get reasonable 3G reception from this person's home. Internet access options start at roughly $60/month. So, I am considering recommending a 3G iPad and using only the 3G service for Internet access.  \nObviously this would be slower than a high speed Wi-Fi connection, but it would also be much cheaper and I think it might be adequate. I am wondering if anyone has experience with using 3G as the primary internet connection source.\n\nA: I use my iPad all day at work for email, web browsing, etc. on 3G and it works fine without Wi-Fi for everyday use.\nFrom a speed perspective, don't sweat it.  For a user who obviously doesn't sound accustomed to blazing broadband, I think 3G will be just fine. Internet is fast enough, Netflix works, and YouTube and the like are fast enough (although YouTube seems to limit the quality of the streams, but it's good enough).\nEDIT: The original version of this answer highlighted why an iPad would not function properly without a computer, which is not true since the release of iOS 5.\n\nA: I can't speak about the iPad specifically, but I've used 3G through Verizon as my primary Internet connection for about 4 years.

{"text": "Q: Mac Pro upgrade path I'm considering a Mac Pro purchase but cannot afford the one I really want. \nThe question is this; Can the cheapest Mac Pro 5,1 single quad-core Nehalem 2.8 GHz be upgraded to the dual six-core Westmere 2.93 GHz at some point in the future?\nIf not, what would be the cheapest one that could? \n\nA: Short answer:\nThe lowest end Mac Pro that can be upgraded to a 2.93 12-core Westmere is the 2.66GHz 12-core Westmere.\nLong answer:\nThe single socket Nehalem and Westmere Mac Pros literally have one socket. Aside from that, most of the lower end configs ship with a 1066MHz memory bus instead of a 1333MHz bus. In order to upgrade to a part that uses faster ram you will need to replace all your ram, and probably solder some resistors to change the clock multipliers on the board.\nWithout SMD soldering you will need to match the bus speed of the processor, which means if you have a 1066MHz memory interface the highest end part you will be able to install is are quad core 2.66GHz Xeon E5640s. There is also no guarantee the firmware will actually initialize it correctly, though odds are good that it will.\n\nA: Yes you can upgrade the Mac Pro 5,1 single quad Nehalem base configuration to a dual 6-core Westmere. There is no soldering or any thing required with in the Mac Pro. Everything is on the back plane with in the Mac Pro, it is the same between all processor configurations.The  dual socket processor tray is where the changes live, that is what really what makes a Mac Pro what it is in terms of RAM, processor sockets, and QPI speed.\n\nIn fact OWC's upgrade services demonstrates the upgrade flexibility of the Mac Pro. Since OWC offers a mail in upgrade service for this version of Mac Pro, where you mail the processor tray to them. They offer single chip upgrades where they swap the CPU and additionally offer dual socket options where they trade processor trays with you for a dual socket version. \nSo all you need to do to upgrade to a faster Westmere Mac Pro is the dual socket process tray and the CPUs to go with it. And it looks like the processor trays are available for order from Apple as noted in this AnandTech botched CPU upgrade article for an older Mac Pro 2009 version. However ordering one might be a trail and error processes, since its probably not a common user part to buy.\n\nThankfully, the folks at the Crabtree Valley Mall Apple Store in Raleigh, NC are AnandTech readers and quickly understood what had happened. They ordered the replacement part and I waited. If you\u2019re curious, it\u2019ll cost a bit under $400 to replace the processor board in an 8-core Mac Pro provided you allow Apple to keep your dead board.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/792", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

I don't care about my warranty; it's long gone.\n\nA: Maybe if this is possible, an AppleTV do not have all the hardware requirement for Snow Leopard, as it needs 1G of RAM. The processor is also only 1 GHz (maybe a bit more, depends on your version) and the lowest Intel processor built on an iMac was a 1.83 GHz Core Duo.\nSo, even if you achieve to install Snow Leopard on your AppleTV (let say you remove the disk, install Mac OS X on it, then plug it in back), it will be really slow.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure it wouldn't work \"by default\" (i.e. without a kernel and bootloader hack). You might be able to run it using OSx86, but I'm really not sure.\nLike Studer said, even if you achieve to install Snow Leopard on your Apple TV, it will be really slow.\n\nA: In addition to my rant answer, I took a look at this thread and did a little skimming.  Sounds like Snow Leopard is not supported due to some unreleased kernel headers.  Not sure why that would matter considering Snow Leopard runs on unsupported x86/64 hardware, but there it is on page 8 from some people who obviously have spent a lot of time with this.\nSo it would seem that there are software issues in addition to the slow hardware.\nHOWEVER, it looks like the aforementioned thread gives quite a bit of practical information on getting Leopard to run!  Might be the way to go since Leopard has lower system requirements anyway.\n\nA: If you have an old AppleTV it may be possible, but to me it seems a bit like a hack. And I wouldn't be at all surprised if the license doesn't allow it. Your Snow Leopard license is probably an upgrade license for Leopard (Apple doesn't sell hardware without OS, so they only sell upgrade licenses I think), and I doubt the Apple TV runs the default version of Leopard.\nIf you can install Snow Leopard then don't use updates, as the kernel needs to be replaced :)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/795", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: Find and Change system shortcut As I know you can find a limit of shortcut in system preference > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcut\nwhere you can find other shortcut and how must change it? for example if I change the cmd + O to enter where can I go? is there any software that can do it for me or I must do it in terminal (How?).  \nP.S: I read some where that list of shortcuts for each apps save in Localized.rsrc but I have 2 problem?\n\n\n*\n\n*I check and in snow leopard I don't have this file.\n\n*How can find general shortcut related to which apps? like capture image or copy & pase or ...\n\n\nA: The shortcuts for each application can be easily changed in the very preference menu you mentioned.\nWhich shortcuts can be changed is determined by what options are in that application's menu. So for Finder, you can customize \"New Finder Window\" and etc. etc. whatever is in the menu. \nTo change the shortcut for \"Open\" (which happens to be Finder -> File -> Open in the menu) you go to the System Preferences Keyboard Shortcuts, go to Application shortcuts, find \"Finder\", press the \"+\" button, and add a new option with name \"Open\" (exactly spelled as the menu option) and enter a keyboard shortcut.\n\nNote that you can't use the enter key or anything: you can only use the modifier keys (shift, command, control, fn) and numbers or letters.\nFor general shortcuts you can scroll up into \"All Applications\" and add a shortcut for \"Copy\" or \"Paste\" or which will toggle for whichever application has that menu option in its menu.\nEDIT: Response to comments:\n1) If you can't find the exact name of a menu command or if there isn't a menu command... well, you just can't set a shortcut unless you use some kind of a third party application that intercepts keystrokes (kinda like AutoHotKey but on Mac). Thus for Quick Look, it doesn't work since the menu command (there is a menu option for it in Finder File->Quick Look) adds the name of the file to be \"Quick Looked\", e.g. \"Quick Look 133.png.\" I believe in Leopard it may have worked if one just set \"Quick Look\" to whatever shortcut under Finder, but it doesn't work in SL for me.\n2) Screen Capture Cmd+Shift+3 is universal: it's a full screen screenshot. Cmd+shift+4 is similar except it lets you select a box to screen shot. I'm not sure what you mean which shortcuts are for which apps... Either it's listed under the app (in the preferences) or it's universal and applies to either every application with the menu option or the system itself.\nEDIT 2: I'll add even more when I have time\na) To my knowledge CUSTOM keyboard shortcuts are stored in com.apple.universalaccess.plist and com.company.application.plist (e.g. com.apple.finder.plist) located in the ~/Library/Preferences folder.\ncom.apple.universalaccess.plist lists the apps with custom shortcuts:\n\ncom.apple.finder.plist lists the actual custom shortcuts for finder under NSUserKeyEquivalents:\n\nEDIT 3:\nb) I believe that the default shortcuts for Cocoa apps are stored in the nib files, for example ../Finder/Contents/Resources/English.lprog/MenuBar.nib or seomthing like that. I've successfully edited these nib files MANUALLY using interface builder to change the keyboard shortcuts for the menu bar items. (Whether there are shortcuts that are not menu bar items and not defined by the system I don't know) Thus I don't know of any command line way either...\nThe nib:\n\nI don't know whether this serves your purpose well. As a side note, for completeness, to edit a compiled nib file like those of finder... is an entirely different answer on its own. This article sums it up well. Basically you work with an uncompiled nib to edit a compiled nib: If you undertake this journey and have trouble finding an uncompiled nib I've uploaded one here.\nIf I ever find a command line method or learn more about where applications store keyboard shortcuts I will update this answer accordingly.\nEDIT: Final Note\nThese nibs are in xml format or something and can be opened by text editors... that might allow for... I don't know. :D\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/808", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "12"}}

I have programs with license keys that I don't want to loose, or buy another copy of, and also just don't want to go through the trouble of reformatting.\nIs there a way I could do this?\n\nA: Boot Camp doesn't require you to reformat your drive. HFS+ partitions can be live-resized by the Boot Camp Assistant or the Disk Utility without going through the trouble of erasing everything. No file on your Mac OS partition will be affected.\nThere is, however, the case where you've had your computer for long and Mac OS has written files all across your drive. In this case, you will need to defragment your drive, in order to put all your files in a nice contiguous space on your hard drive, so that all the remaining space is contiguous too and a partition can be made there. As far as I know, iDefrag can do this for about $15. (Disclaimer: I never did it and can't guarantee it will work. But it should. Can someone confirm?)\nThe other way, if you have an external drive, is to copy all your files to this external drive using a software like Carbon Copy Cloner (free), reformat your drive, then copy them all back to your drive. Everything should be like before and you'll have no hassle except the time required to copy back and forth (your programs and your serial numbers and the such will be intact).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/815", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

{"text": "Q: Can anyone recommend a good tutorial for writing (from scratch) a cron-style launchd job? I've got a fairly simple job that I'd like to run every hour. I could do it using cron, but I thought I'd use this to learn about launchd, since I hear good things about it. I've got the man launchd.plist page as a reference, but I'm looking for something based more around building an example job.\n\nA: I know it's not a good tutorial, but you could have a look at the Daemons and Services Programming Guide from Apple, which has a section on Scheduling Timed Jobs.\nI know it's not a full tutorial, but, with it, you can understand the basics of launchd.\nIt also provides an example of a crond task :\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\"\n\"http://www.apple.\ncom/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>  \n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.apple.periodic-daily</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array> \n        <string>/usr/sbin/periodic</string>\n        <string>daily</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>LowPriorityIO</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>Nice</key>\n    <integer>1</integer>\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <dict>  \n        <key>Hour</key>\n        <integer>3</integer>\n        <key>Minute</key>\n        <integer>15</integer>\n    </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: This has helped me a lot: http://launchd.info\nIt covers configuration, administration and troubleshooting using Terminal or the launchd GUI LaunchControl. Examples are provided as well.\n\nA: I know you were looking for a tutorial, but on the off-chance someone comes here as part of looking for a tool to help them make/edit launchd entries, I've used this before: Lingon (sourceforge) \nIt's no longer being actively developed but what's there does work (and obviously includes source etc). I've used it on Snow Leopard to schedule backups to the Amazon cloud, etc.\n\nA: launchd runs Daemons (/Library/LaunchDaemons or /System/Library/LaunchDaemons) as root, and will run them regardless of whether users are logged in or not. Launch Agents (/Library/LaunchAgents/ or ~/Library/LaunchAgents/) are run when a user is logged in as that user. You can not use setuid to change the user running the script on daemons. The /System directory is reserved for Mac OS X tasks so I recommend putting your launchd plists into either the /Library or the ~/Library folder as it makes sense.\nSo the first step is determining if you're making an agent or a daemon.\nThe second step is to make your .plist file. You can use GUI-based programs such as Lingon to help with this or just use your favourite text editor:\nA sample .plist for running a script every hour (StartInterval or StartIntervalCalendar are the keys we want - StartInterval for an item to happen every x seconds, StartIntervalCalendar for a specific time and/or date. See 126907 on SuperUser for an example I made with StartCalendarInterval):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>local.IDENTIFIER_HERE.SOMETHING</string>\n    <key>OnDemand</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>UserName</key>\n    <string>USERNAME HERE</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/PATH/TO/SCRIPT</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>Argument_1</string>\n        <string>Argument_2</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>StartInterval</key>\n    <integer>3600</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nModify the .plist as necessary to point to your script and any arguments as necessary (arguments are on separate lines) and save the file with the same name as the Label value but with .plist at the end. (for example, local.my-mac.flickrstats would be saved as local.my-mac.flickrstats.plist). If you haven't already, move that .plist file to /Library/LaunchDaemons when making a Daemon (runs all the time) or to ~/Library/LaunchAgents (only you're logged in) or /Library/LaunchAgents (any user is logged in).\nTo start the job you want to run launchctl as necessary to load the file. For items in /Library, you should use sudo: for example, sudo launchctl load -w /PATH/TO/PLIST\nFor reference also check out the following questions on Super User: Launchd command as root, Load a system wide daemon, and How can I get a script to run every day\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/820", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "20"}}

Recently I have been having an issue where at least once a month my Spotlight index gets corrupted, and I can no longer search the content of mail in Mail.app. I can fix the problem by taking my HD out of Spotlight, and then putting it back in, but it then takes about 4 hours to re-index the drive.\nWhy is my Spotlight index getting munged?

{"text": "Q: Do Macs need to be defragmented? I don't see any application to defragment my Mac (running OS X).\nIs defragmenting not necessary for Mac OS X?  If so, why not?\n\nA: It's not necessary. For more details than you could possibly want, read Fragmentation in HFS Plus Volumes by Amit Singh (author of  Mac OS X Internals: A Systems Approach).\n\nA: There's no such thing which you should (have to) use. If Apple felt it was needed, it would have been built-in.\nMac differs entirely from Windows for example.\nPlease check: http://osxdaily.com/2014/01/13/defrag-mac-hard-drive-necessary-or-not/\n\nA: HFS, the filesystem Mac OS X uses (technically HFS+) has a number of built-in measures that reduce fragmentation of the drive. First, it uses extent-based allocation, which is just a fancy way of saying that it writes multiple contiguous blocks of data a time (and therefore inherently has less fragmentation of data). Second, it uses delayed allocation, meaning that disks writes are \"queued\" and written to the drive as a group (again, inherently less fragmentation). On top of that, Mac OS X does on the fly defragmentation of files.\nThe long and short is that fragmentation isn't really an issue for Macs, which is why you don't see a program to defragment drives in Mac OS X.\nAs a side note, there are commercial programs that will defragment drives in OS X, but this is essentially snake-oil. There might be some small level of fragmentation on your drive, and these apps will surely take care of that. But, it's 100% unnecessary, and you're unlikely to see any benefit.  \n\nA: Most people will tell you Macs don't suffer from disk fragmentation, citing technical arguments most people don't understand.\nIt's somewhat true: since there's nothing you can do about it without spending $20 on something that might not improve the performance of your computer at all, you could instead focus on other maintenance tasks and just buy a shiny new mac (or reinstall) when the old one gets too slow.\nBut: An important prerequisite for not caring about disk fragmentation is always keeping some free space on your disk (I couldn't find any recommendation not pulled out of thin air, but 20% is often mentioned).\nAnd to keep the facts straight:\n\n*\n\n*There are features in Mac OS X designed to prevent some of fragmentation.\n\n*Apple believes these features are enough to spare the majority of their users from caring about fragmentation issues, but also says you ''might'' benefit from defragmenting in some cases (e.g. \"If your disks are almost full, and you often modify or create large files\")\n\n*There's no built-in or free and popular defragmenter utility for Mac OS X (although there are commercial ones)\n\n*Some people do have issues caused by fragmentation (1, 2)\n\n*There's no easy way to tell if your specific problem is caused by fragmentation.\n\nBTW (@Dori's answer), the cited Fragmentation in HFS Plus Volumes explicitly says this:\n\nNote that I do not intend to make any claims regarding the fragmentation-resistance of HFS+. I have sampled too few a volume to generalize my \"results\".\n\nP.S. I know that web browsers (the field I'm interested in) are at least sometimes are affected by fragmentation (ex.: mozilla, chrome). I myself had an issue similar to the one described in mozillla's issue tracker.\n\nA: Generally speaking, you do not need to defrag HFS+. While it is possible to fragment it, the implementation in the OS X kernel includes a number of features that tend to limit fragmentation, including deferred block allocation and hot banding. Unless you do something really odd (constantly keep the drive over 99% full while doing lots of reads and deletes) it is very hard to significantly fragment the drive.\nThe only time it is generally worthwhile to defrag an OS X drive is when you are trying to do an LVM operation (like shrink a partition for bootcamp), and the builtin tools fail. The reason is that those failures are largely caused by some core structure of the volume (Like the extents or catalog file) existing in blocks outside the target layout. Technically those are files, but because they are used to store volume metadata the builtin file move code has trouble moving them on a live (mounted) partition, but defrag utilities that work on the disk offline can just move them to the beginning of the partition, which allows the volume resizer to work.\nSo, while defrag utils are generally not worthwhile, they aren't snake oil, just very specialized tools.\n\nA: No, it doesn't. Mac OS X does it itself for files over 20MB, and for SSDs it doesn't matter at all.\n\nA: osx obviously needs defragmenters when you need to shrink the partitions where it is installed, or when you use hfs+ somewhere else\nan excellent example is when you, after only using osx for years and start to use a dual-boot there, like installing a second operating system like gnu/linux (exactly like i did this week), and it is known gnu/linux (like ubuntu) are getting mroe and more popular day by day, specially among osx users - in this context, and it is not as rare, it is totally counterproductive and nonsense having to backup all the information, reformat the partition after resizing it, reinstall osx back again when you just needed to defrag it before resizing it\nso everyone, please don\u2019t say no one need defrag tools on osx, or for hfs+ - saying such thing is just ludicrous, as i explained... \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/829", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "56"}}
{"text": "Q: Is there a limit on the number of Macs that can use a single 2TB Time Capsule? I am looking at buying a few of the 2TB Time Capsules for our office, where we have about 20 unibody MacBook Pros with 128GB SSDs.\nIs there a limit on the number of Macs that a single 2TB Time Capsule can provide Time Machine backup targets to? Does anyone have advice or experience regarding using a Time Capsule as a target for multiple machines?\n\nA: According to this post on Apple's product page for the Time Capsule, up to 100 machines can use a single Time Capsule. The source of the \"100\" is not accredited, so it may not be accurate.\n\nA: I would take care with having several Time Capsules as you will then have several Wireless networks and you need to work out how they interconnect.\nIt might be better to get some NAS and run Time Machine on that e.g. Netgear or even a Mac and run OS X server on that.\n\nA: There shouldn\u2019t be any technical limit other than hard drive space. Each backup gets stored in different directories inside the volume. However, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d start running out of space fast if you have more than two-three machines that actively create/edit data. \n\nA: I use a LaCie d2 Quadra Hard Disk with TimeMachine and have so far backed up 6 different machines with it and recovered 2 times. I don't know if there is an upper limit.\n\nA: This is a very workable solution. There is no built in limit and you can look over the system logs to see if any machines take too long to back up due to slowness and lighten the load on any one Time Capsule as needed.\nFor some people it's ideal, very maintainable, and drop dead simple to plan and support.\nYou can use BackupLoupe to look into the individual backups to see what files are changing and estimate how fast each Mac is filling up the space on the backup drives. You could use one Mac connected to the Ethernet port to scan the files without any WiFi delays and once scanned, you have the information on that Mac to examine \"offline\". You can mount the volumes and scan them as needed to update them as time passes - maybe once a month to check on things.\nDo run a comparison on how much it would cost to buy a Mac mini server and use it to back up everything in one spot instead of several Time Capsules. You could then save money on the networking with Extremes and Expresses and have better expansion options.

{"text": "Q: Should I turn my iPad off to replace the MicroSIM? Should I turn my iPad off to replace the MicroSIM card?\n\nA: If by \"3g chip\", you are referring to the iPad MicroSIM card, then no, you do not need to power off the device to switch it out. However, if you're referring to the actual 3G radio inside the iPad, my advice is to take it to an Apple store and have the repair done by an Apple technician, as operating on the device yourself is likely to void the warranty.\n\nA: Yes, you should turn off your iPad before doing anything with the innards.\n\nA: It always better to switch off such devices before replacing SIMs.  With the exception of USB ports found on computers, its always recommended to turn off devices before connecting or replacing cables and chips.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/846", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}
{"text": "Q: Do any window managers allow me to snap windows to the sides of the display? Can you recommend a Window Manager for the Mac? I would like to have a keyboard shortcut that would snap a windows to the left or right half of my screen. \n\nA: Divvy\n\nDivvy is a little menubar app that\n  allows you to automatically resize any\n  active window. Divviy virtually\n  divides your screen into a 6x6 grid.\n  When invoked, Divvy brings up a little\n  HUD in the middle of the screen with\n  this 6x6 grid. Depending on what part\n  of your screen you want to resize your\n  active window, just drag and select\n  those squares on the HUD and the\n  window does the rest. It\u2019s that\n  simple.\n\n\nA: After testing SizeUp and Breeze, I've decided that Breeze fits my needs the best. Both allow you to position windows on the left, right, or Fullscreen. The feature that sold it for me was setting a default size & position for an application and assigning it a shortcut key.\n\nA: ShiftIt (original version at link discontinued) does this, and is free and open source.\nEdit: The project is now on GitHub, however the last release was in November 2010.\n\nA: Moom\nI've heard some people talk this one up too:\n\nDo you spend a lot of time moving and zooming windows, so you can better see and work with all the content on your Mac? Instead of doing that work yourself, let Moom handle the task for you.\n\n\nA: If you have a magic mouse or magic trackpad, BetterTouchTool is better as you can set specific gestures to manage the windows. Like a four finger left swipe can be to resize the window to the left 50% of the screen. \n\nA: Moom is great. You can snap windows to: full screen, half screen, quarter screen. You can also resize with a grid. It supports custom keyboard shortcuts, too.\n\n\nA: I personally use SizeUp and Divvy on a daily basis.  If I had known about ShiftIt earlier, I probably wouldn't have paid for SizeUp.  Another one to check out that hasn't been mentioned yet is BetterTouchTool, which has a lot of other features, but hidden in the advanced options is a nice feature they call \"Window Snapping\" which snaps the window to the left or right of the screen when you drag it to the side.  Doesn't have keyboard shortcut functionality included, but it is a nice supplement to SizeUp and Divvy.\n\nA: I found here from an off topic question on Stack Overflow: \nThere were two Open Source mangers mentioned there that did not show up on this list:\n\n\n*\n\n*Spectacle -> http://spectacleapp.com/\n\n*Slate -> https://github.com/jigish/slate (setup requires work on the command line)\n\n\nAnother from the App Store\n\n\n*\n\n*Slicer -> https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slicer/id487999732?mt=12\n\nA: Here is an Applescript that will tile all of the open windows in the frontmost application.

Similar to \"tiled windows\" functionality available on other operating systems.\n\n\n\nA: First of all, if free is important to you, get ShiftIt.\nIf convenience from a mouse is important to you, get Cinch.

It's like having a mouse with 100+ buttons.\nJiTouch\n\nA: From what I've seen and heard, Cinch is a great application for bringing the window management of Windows 7 to Mac OS X.\n\nA: MercuryMover\nYou might also look at MercuryMover, which gives you a range of window moving tools under a series of keyboard mappings. I used to use this a lot when struggling with a small laptop screen, and you can get it to flip a window to the edge of a screen etc. It most closely maps the 'move' system menu functionality that you get in normal Windows 'windows'.\n\nA: I'm using Magnet, is available on the AppStore\n\nhttp://magnet.crowdcafe.com\n\nA: As far as I understand you question, you want to stick the window to the edge of the screen, so that the side of the window is directly on the edge of the screen. This is now possible on macOS Sierra (10.12) natively.\nAll you need to do is to move the window you want to position (by clicking and dragging the top of the window) to the side that you want it to stick to. You need to do this slowly, or else it won't work. After you drag the window over to the edge, it will stick a while and that's when you should stop.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/850", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "21"}}
{"text": "Q: Quicksilver goes straight to text-entry mode On my old-ish MacBook Pro (pre-unibody), Quicksilver has been misbehaving for quite some time.

{"text": "Q: How can I free up some disk space? I'm about to run out of disk space, and I know I have a lot of junk on my macbook but I don't know how to find it to figure out how to delete it.\nIs there an easy command line way through terminal to list my biggest files on my drive?  Or is there a GUI program that could help me find all the offending huge files that I'm not using?\n\nA: Start with Monolingual: http://monolingual.sourceforge.net/ it removes extra languages and locales from your computer. Saves quite a bit of space without any real loss of usability (unless you speak several languages and want to use them...)\n\nA: If you're looking for specific things to tear out, look at all the Garageband samples and support files. They take up a LOT of space, and if you're not going to be making music you won't miss 'em.\n\nA: You can try :\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk Inventory X (free one)\n\n\n*DaisyDisk (paid one)\n\n\nA: I really like What Size - it's also on the Mac App store, but has many features that won't be allowed on the store (like checking sizes as the administrator, and actually deleting / thinning files to remove code that can't possibly be run like PPC code on an intel mac).\n\nIt is paid software - but well worth the expense for me. I have used it over slow network connections, many external drives and my boot volume to see quickly where all the space is so I can know what is possible to clean up and when it's just not possible due to there being no huge folders or files that I can afford to remove.\n\nThe find duplicates function is great and there are many other views, but it's geared to giving you the biggest space users on top no matter what view you choose.\n\nA: Omni Disk Sweeper by Omni Group is good at helping find the mountains of stuff.\nI find that apps and the system folders generally don't take up that much space (everything being relative), that the real hogs are in the Documents, Music, and Movies folders of my user folder.\n\nA: Two things...\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are starting to run out of disk space deleting files isn't going to help much unless you have massive amounts of waste, eg Old systems from doing an archive and install OS update.Start thinking about getting a bigger hard drive or some extra drives.\n\n*In terminal type...\ndu -hs *\nThis will list each directory with it's size. It will look smething like this...\n3.6G    Desktop\n3.9G    Development\n 42G    Documents\n1.6G    Downloads\n4.5M    Dropbox\n\nIf anything looks unexpectedly large cd into the directory and run the command again. Rinse and repeat until you find what you are looking for.\n\nA: I highly recommend GrandPerspective(Free).  Just finding the largest files isn't always that useful: 20 gbs of 3mb music files wouldn't show up, for example.  GrandPerspective gives you a great visual breakdown of your harddrive contents regardless of whether your wasted files are in one big .dmg or a few hundred small files or whatever.  Further, if you know most waste is in, for example, your home folder, you can specify which directory to show.\n\n\nA: You can also set Finder to the horizontal list view (not sure what that view is called), enable the Size column (see View Options, CMD J), and select \"Calculate All Sizes\" again in the View Options window.\nNow sort by size. Start off in your Home folder. See what sub-folders are biggest. Drill down and explore.\n\nA: While I agree with all suggestions above regarding apps that help you to visualize what is taking space on your HDD, you may find yourself in situation where you actually can't delete those files and have to keep it on your hard drive.\nIn this case, you can use this utility - Squeeze to transparently compress your files in the background.

{"text": "Q: How can I Open Multiple Customized Terminal Shells? How can I customized Terminal so that when I open the application it opens several shell tabs?\nIf possible I would like to also have it run a different environment script for each tab. \nExample: Run this command source bin/activate which is a Python virtualenv setup command. \n\nA: Add this to your ~/.bash_profile if you use bash or ~/.zshrc if you use zsh, changing the content of the COMMANDS array:\nfunction openterms() {\n    COMMANDS=(\"source bin/activate\" \"add another here\" \"continue likewise\")\n    for command in $COMMANDS\n        do osascript -e \\\n        \"tell application \\\"Terminal\\\" to do script with command \\\"$command\\\"\"\n    done\n}\n\nNow calling openterms in a shell will open all the other shells you wanted.\n\nA: I'm using Keyboard Maestro. I once recorded a macro that sets up Terminal (I'm using iTerm, but it doesn't matter) the way I like and made this macro to be triggered by launching iTerm.\nSo when I launch, it is set up as I wanted. Two windows, five tabs in one for different folders with each Tab named appropriately, and another window with two tabs connected to my server, one of them launches a monitoring script. All of this is done within 2 seconds that the Terminal is launched, which previouosly would take a minute or more.\nNow I'm not that afraid to close iTerm if I need since I can reopen it at the same state without any effort.\nBy the way, Keyboard Maestro is good for many other things too. I recently bought it with discount on mupromo.com, where I've discovered it for the first time but it's worth its full price, too, in my opinion.\n\nA: As Josh K mentioned, you can create a Window Group for opening one or more windows with specific layouts and appearances. In addition, \"settings profiles\" (Terminal > Preferences > Settings) can specify a command to run when a terminal is created with that profile. You can create a separate profile for each command you wish to run, then create windows with those profiles. When you save them to a window group and open them again, those commands will run in their appropriate windows. You can even have Terminal open a specific window group at startup.\nAs of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, there are several new improvements in this area:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resume will automatically restore windows that were open when you quit Terminal, so using a window group for this is no longer strictly necessary (although they allow you to re-create a specific setup if you've closed the windows).\n\n*If you create a new terminal using Shell > New Command, since Terminal knows what command you ran, it can restore it by running it again. Terminal will now automatically restore \"safe\" commands\u2020 when Resuming.\n\n*Terminal will also restore these commands if you save these kinds of terminals into a window group. In addition, when saving a window group, there's an option to restore all commands, not just the \"safe\" ones. So, you no longer need to create a separate settings profile for each command you want to run.\n\u2020 \"Safe\" commands include anything listed in /etc/shells, emacs, vi/vim, nano, pico, top, screen, tmux, and any command created with Shell > New Remote Connection (e.g., ssh sessions). Note that only top is considered \"safe\" when used with arguments; the others support arguments that may do things you wouldn't want them to without user confirmation, so they are not considered \"safe\" for automatic restoration unless they are invoked without arguments. You can customize the list of \"safe\" commands with \"defaults write com.apple.Terminal RestorableCommands\". The value is a list of strings containing the command names. To indicate that arguments are allowed, add an asterisk after a command. e.g., \"top *\" makes top safe when used with arguments, but \"top\" does not.\n\nA: Alternatively, you can also use screen to open multiple tabs on a single window. screen is very flexible and can configure to run any scripts during the terminal startup.\nMore info.\n\nA: Does this post describe what you want to do?\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/863", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}

{"text": "Q: Safari - Top Sites disappears after another app went rogue  A few days ago an app went rogue and leaked memory taking up all 4gb of RAM and more than 8gb of page file space. The result was a machine which was unusable and took about 20 minutes to (eventually) shut down. \nAfter rebooting Safari would not show my \"Top Sites\", instead showed me a \"This page could not be found\" (or something similar, I can't remember), would not display the \"Top Sites\" button on the menu, and the button was not available in the list of buttons to add.\nAfter a reboot this was resolved, but I would still like to know what went wrong.\nDoes anyone know what could have gone wrong here?\n\nA: I don\u2019t really know the right answer, but I have a guess. \nYou mention that you use safari on Windows, but you don\u2019t mention the window\u2019s version.

{"text": "Q: Can I safely charge my iPhone 4 overnight on a regular basis? First time caller, long time listener:  I've seen this question asked on a few other sites but with no \"definitive\" answers.\nThe Apple website on iPhone batteries is ambiguous, at best, and the closest it comes to answering the question is saying that a monthly deep cycle is a good idea.  (reference)\nSo, what do you think -- is there an adverse impact from repeated, overnight charging of your iPhone 4?  Does this negatively affect battery performance over the long term?  Or is there some chip/ software that acts to shut off the charging once the battery is topped off, thereby protecting your hermetically sealed little power source?\n\nA: Each charge 'cycle' is registered within the phone's software (same on a MacBook).  If you think your battery is having issue (and is still under warranty), Apple will look at the number of charge cycles on it and make a decision against that.\nHere's a pretty interesting, in depth article from 2007 on Apple's take on 'charge cycles':\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/58916/2007/07/iphonebattery.html\n\nA: All this hype about how to charge your batteries is blown out of proportion.\nAlthough some batteries (I forget which types exactly) can have longer lives if charged at \"optimal\" rates and temperatures, the reality seems to be that it does not extend the life by much. One of the research papers I read concluded something like if you charge your device at around 17 degrees from 0% until 75% full you can extend the lifespan by about 1/5 of the total life span.\nI have charged my devices for days at a time, and my iPod Nano has been plugged in for months, and holds a charge the same as my other nano (I have two) which almost never gets used and only charged ocasionally.\nIn conclusion, just do whatever is convenient for you.\nEDIT: Here are some links to the apple pages related to their iPhone batteries:\n\n\n*\n\n*Batteries - iPhone\n\n*iPhone Battery Replacement Service: Frequently Asked Questions\n\nA: First of all, iPhone uses lithium-ion batteries, so you should follow the same advice as for the laptop batteries. Look at this and this questions at SuperUser.\nThe most two damaging things to Li-Ion batteries are deep discharge and heat.\nDeep discharge is when you use the device until it shuts down, then wait and attempt to turn it on. That's bad practice - you should stop using the battery and think of charging it as soon as the device turns off for the first time. Deep discharge can severely damage the battery. Similar batteries are used in profesional Bosch power tools like drills and drivers. Obviously battery is a heart of such tool. When you continuosly use a tool its battery can get discarged suddenly and then the tool will shut off - you will be holding the switch pressed but the tool will just stop rotating. The manual says clearly that you shouldn't try to release the switch and press it again to try to restart the tool - according to the manual that can damage the battery.\nHeat lowers battery lifetime. Heat comes from leaving the phone under direct sunlight, carrying it in a pocket close to your bode in hot weather, putting it next to a heater and so on.\nObviously you shouldn't do stupid things like piercing, burning, short-curcuiting and dropping the iPhone. All other factors like how often you charge it will have very limited impact on the battery lifetime. Even Bosch power tools manuals don't ever mention anything about how good or bad is charging the batteries often.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/893", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "34"}}
{"text": "Q: How can I contact the owner of a lost iPhone who has a password lock?

Love it!\nObviously only works if the owner has set their phone to utilise Siri when locked. But I think most people do.\n\nA: If there is a lost and found at the location you found the phone put it there, or turn it over to the police. That is where the person who lost it should be looking for it.\nAttempting to break the PIN is just not a good idea, even if you have good intentions. They chose to keep some information confidential (for whatever reason), at the expense of making the phone harder to return if it is lost.\n\nA: *\n\n*Keep it plugged in / charged in case the user is trying to \"find my phone\" and locate it or send you a contact message. \n\n*The carrier and apple might take your contact information if you don't want to drop it off with them. Apple might be better than the carrier if there is any doubt as to the proper carrier. \n\n*Local police should be alerted - they can provide you with your responsibilities as well as how best to get it returned. \n\n\nI hope you make the owner very happy. \n\nA: Starting with iOS 6, owners will be able to help you out by sending a number to the phone using the new \"Lost\" mode:\n\nIOS 6 and iCloud now offer Lost mode, making it even easier to use\n  Find My iPhone to locate and protect a missing device.6 Immediately\n  lock your missing iPhone with a four-digit passcode and send it a\n  message displaying a contact number.

If this is the case, pop the SIM card out. Put it in another phone. Find the number. Now, use the web to do a reverse lookup, find them, find their email or alternate phone, and call them.\n2) Find someone who knows the owner\nWhen you set the password, by default the \"Voice Dial\" is still active. Try holding down the home button for 4 seconds. Even when locked, you might be able to say \"Call so-and-so\". Try some random names. If someone picks up, explain the situation. They will probably have an alternate means of contacting the owner.\n3) Turn the phone on and see if there are recent callers - then use any of these names to try voice calling as in 2 above.\n\nA: By strange coincidence, this exact thing happened to me, so I have the answer:\nWait until the owner's mother calls.  Answer the phone, explain the situation, upon which she will send her husband to collect the phone from your office.*  Shake the father's hand, hand over the phone, and make a funny apple joke (he asked me if I had kids, to-whit I responded, no, but I have an iPhone, so I understand! -- fan boys rejoice).\n*As it turns out, the owner was a 15 year old boy.\n\nA: You can try a number of things. To build on mankoff's answer:\n1)Try taking out the SIM card and checking if there are any contacts on it. If the iPhone was not the first phone used with that SIM, it may have stored contacts on it.\n2)Try \"Call home\".\nAlso, I remember seeing this article a while back, I wonder if it still works with iPhone 4: Read iPhone Data with Ubuntu \nEdit (Direct Quote):\n\nDo you have a PIN code on your iPhone?\n  Well, while that might protect you\n  from someone making a call or fiddling\n  with your apps, it doesn\u2019t prevent\n  access to your data \u2026 as long as the\n  person doing the snooping around is\n  using Ubuntu \u201cLucid Lynx\u201d 10.04.\nSecurity experts Bernd Marienfeldt and\n  Jim Herbeck discovered something\n  really interesting when they hooked up\n  a non-jailbroken, fully up-to-date\n  iPhone 3GS to a PC running Lucid Lynx\n  \u2026\nI uncovered a data protection\n  vulnerability [9], which  I could\n  reproduce on 3 other non jail broken\n  3GS iPhones (MC 131B, MC132B) with\n  different iPhone OS versions installed\n  (3.1.3-7E18 modem firmware 05.12.01\n  and version 3.1.2 -7D11, modem\n  05.11.07) , all PIN code protected which means the vulnerability bypasses\n  authentication for various data where\n  people most likely rely on data\n  protection through encryption and do\n  not expect that authentication is not\n  in place.\nThis is what you get via an auto mount\n  without any PIN request:\n\nThis data protection flaw exposes\n  music, photos, videos, podcasts, voice\n  recordings, Google safe browsing\n  database, game contents\u2026 by in my\n  opinion the quickest compromising\n  read/write access discovered so far,\n  without leaving any track record by\n  the attacker. It\u2019s about to imagine\n  how many enterprises (e.g. Fortune\n  100) actually do rely on the\n  expectation that their iPhone 3GS\u2019s\n  whole content is protected by\n  encryption with an PIN code based\n  authentication in place to unlock it.\nThis, quite honestly, is a staggering\n  flaw. It basically allows anyone\n  capable of driving a Linux PC to copy\n  data off of an iPhone without the\n  owner of the phone having any idea\n  whatsoever that this has happened.\nWhat\u2019s more worrying is that\n  Marienfeldt and Herbeck think that\n  write access to the iPhone is only a\n  buffer overflow away, which means\n  serious access.\n\nLastly, an Apple store would have the serial number linked to an iPhone, as Philip Reagan suggested.\n\nA: Take it to the Apple store and see if they can sort it out. I would imagine that they have DB of serial numbers and customers even if they didn't sign up with Applecare or MobileMe.\n\nA: You can use Siri to call some of the contacts.  \nYou probably know no names in his/her contacts list so you should ask Siri:\n\n\n*\n\n*to call Home\n\n*to call my Mother/father\n\n*to give me the directions to home\n\n*what is my name\n\n*who is my sister/brother.\n\n\nWhen you ask Siri about contacts, it would bring up ALL the contacts information that is entered in the iphone/icloud. \nSo if the iphone is connected to wifi/3g/4g and siri is enabled, you have access to the owner's identity(home, relative names, other phone numbers, addresses).\nIf the wifi and 3g is turned off, you would have some hard time dealing with it.\n\nA: I'm trying a different tactic. I wrote a note telling them to call the phone or call my number and I took a picture of it with their phone. Hopefully it will upload to Photo Stream. It looks like 3G is on but I'm not sure if it will only upload over wifi. Oh, well. It's worth a shot...\n\nA: Just wait for the owner to call once they realize they lost it. Just found an iPhone on the way home and as I was searching for 'How to find an owner of a locked iPhone', it rang. The owners wife, Viola'! Set up a meeting and hope someone will do the same for me someday. \n\nA: plug the phone into iTunes to get data like the name or other identifiers!!\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/901", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "24"}}

Tested on Mac OS X 10.8.2, seems to work.\nhttp://community.skype.com/t5/Mac/How-to-create-two-instances-of-Skype-on-the-Desktop/m-p/1626/highlight/true#M38\nhttp://horizonsplit.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/running-2-and-more-skype-instances-on-mac-os-x-simultaneously/ (just a copy for the sake of redundancy)\n\nA: If you only want to run a second instance of Skype, you can do this on the same OS X account with a little bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\nrm ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Skype/Skype.pid\nsleep 1\nopen -n \"/Applications/Skype.app\"\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/Strayer/4dd565cc4b5db72b9363\n\nA: Is it possible to copy  Skype.app to PersonalSkype.app and then running both ?\nI have tried this with VLC (one version was 32bit and other was 64bit+older version), and they worked fine.\n\nA: Although duplicating your copy of skype will certainly run two copies (or more), both will use the same properties and will share a lot of things, therefore creating possible chaos. \nIf it helps, you can create groups in skype and drag contacts to the groups. I have separated people I know, business and strangers from games or people I don\u2019t know. \nSkype\u2019s service is really good, but their application is far from good and intuitive. \n\nA: If you don't want to mess around with \"su\" and the command line, try Peek-o-Matic, designed for this type of generic situation, but it appears from the developer comments that it is heavily used by Skype users wanting multiple instances just as you do.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/903", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

{"text": "Q: Time Machine backup .sparsebundle file inaccessible on new computer I've been at this for a solid 6 hours now, hoping like heck someone here can help me.\nI've had a Time Capsule for nearly 2 years, consistently backing up two different laptops in my home using Time Machine. A MacBook and a MacBook Pro.\nLast night, my MacBook Pro up and died. I was working on it when everything froze up and shut down, and it won't boot now. All indicators are that the logic board went. Whatever, **** happens. Sucks, but not entirely a loss because of my incremental backups, right?\nWrong.\nBrought my work laptop (another Macbook Pro) home this evening to open up my Time Machine backups and retrieve any files that I needed or wanted to keep going forward. Or so I thought.\nWhen I connect to the drive, I can see two .sparsebundle files, one from the Macbook, and one from the Macbook Pro. In the past, I've been able to mount these as disks and manually sort through them without having to resort to the slow Star Wars interface of Time Machine.\nThe .sparsebundle for the MacBook works exactly as advertised. The .sparsebundle for the Macbook Pro? Not at all. Double-clicking it gives the error \"No mountable file systems.\" Disk Utility (pictured below) has it greyed out and refuses to run any Verify or Repair procedures on it. I've tried the Googles, gone through countless discussion threads in Apple's support site as well as other popular Mac tech sites, resorted to Terminal hdiutil mount -readwrite style hacking, all to no avail. As far as I can tell from the research I've done, what may have happened is that my MacBook Pro was in the middle of a Time Machine backup at the very second it went kaput, which seems to have locked the .sparsebundle into some kind of hyper-militant read-only state from whence not even light can escape.\nThe message in the window pictured below comes up immediately after I click \"Repair disk\", though the candybar progress stripe keeps spinning and spinning indefinitely.\nI've got no ideas left.

However, I only want to grant AFP access to users on ONE of the networks, but not the other.

You can configure from the command line, the exact rule set you need depends on your other requirements, but the specific rule in question would be something like:\n# allow AFP (port 548) traffic from 10net\n/sbin/ipfw add allow tcp from 10.0.0/24 to any 548\n\n# deny all other AFP traffic \nipfw add deny tcp from any to any 548\n\nObviously you will need to adjust that for your specific network. Also, these rules are not persistent, which means you will need to add a script to run them commands every reboot. On the other hand, that means that if you wedge your networking while trying to come up with appropriate rules you can always just reboot to reset the stack. There are plenty of ipfw tutorials on the web (most of them are aimed at FreeBSD users, but it is the same interface).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/960", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

It solved everything magically (both Picasa and all other softwares)\n\nA: It's hard to tell which of two things is the real issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Phone has some corrupt pictures.\n\n*The databases on your Mac used to track which pictures are imported are corrupt / iPhoto is corrupt.\n\n\nYou can rule out #2 by taking the phone to another mac (or at least make another user on the same mac to try an import from a clean slate).\nAs has been mentioned before - if the pictures are corrupt on the iOS device, you will have to spring for PhoneView and perhaps a tool like Data Rescue to see if the photos are salvageable. Often JPEG headers and such are bad and the image data is fine or patchable with little or no visual evidence of the corruption.\nAlso - it could be a combination of both #1 and #2 which is why some work under PhoneView and others don't. Lastly - you could try restoring that backup onto another iOS device and importing the photos from there. It would rule out a problem with the phone which is highly less likely than the other two items listed above.\n\nA: One item not yet mentioned is that your hard drive could be full. I was getting this error until I made some space.\n\nA: +1 for Phoneview for being a great app, but I understand not wanting to buy an app. \nAs an alternative, you should look at this fee app, it seems like it will do what you need. \nhttp://www.macroplant.com/iphoneexplorer/\nYour best bet is probably going to be to get all the photos off of the iPhone you want/need by dragging them to your desktop/folder. Then import them into iPhoto. \nThen do a backup of your phone in iTunes. I'd wipe the iPhone and re-install iOS via iTunes. Then once the operating system has been installed, iTunes will ask if you want to restore your backup. \nIf there is an issue with your photos/data then this may not help. However, if there is an issue with the underlying iOS then this may fix things for you. \n\nA: I have read in Apple's Support Forums that the Image Capture app (which is included on OSX, in the Utilities folder) will import these \"corrupted\" photos okay while iPhoto will not.\nLike others, I'm still waiting a permanent solution (even an acknowledgement) from Apple.\n\nA: *\n\n*Close iPhoto make sure their isn't a white light appearing under the icon. \n\n*Go to your pictures folder and drag the iPhoto library icon onto your desktop. \n\n*Open up iPhoto and click on create new library. \n\n*Once it opens, move it so you can see the iPhoto library icon on your desktop. \n\n*Right-click on the iPhoto icon and click on 'Show Package Contents.' \n\n*Drag the files Library.iPhoto and Library6.iPhoto onto iPhoto. \n\n\nIt should be working after that.\n\nA: I've found iPhoto can be picky when it comes to things like color formats. For example, iPhoto returned the same error when I tried importing an image that was in Grayscale. I had to convert it to RGB first before iPhoto would import it. I've read elsewhere that iPhoto can also be picky about layers.\n\nA: Update! update! update!\nMake sure both your iPhone and Mac are on the latest versions of OS X (10.6.8) and iOS (4.3.3). Also, (if it's possible) upgrade to iLife '11.\nIf that doesn't fix your problem, try backing up (through iTunes) and restoring your iPhone. Also, try using photo syncing (through iTunes) instead of manually copying over the photos.\n\nA: There's a problem importing photos from the iPhone (4S) to iPhoto; some photos are getting corrupted during the import process. It appears to be well-documented here.\n\nA: Hmmm... I tried some of the suggested solutions here and ultimately I decided to simply free up my hard drive a litte bit. So, I deleted some old photos and movies and voil\u00e0 --- no more error message. :)\n\nA: Do you really need IMG_0301.JPG ?\nIf not you could try clicking 'Delete' instead of 'Keep' to empty the library and hopefully get rid of IMG_0301.JPG and then sync the photos back to the phone if required. \n\nA: Try Disk Utility to check/repair permissions on the volume holding the iTunes library.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/971", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "24"}}

{"text": "Q: What parts can you scavenge from a nearly 3 year old MacBook Pro? I have an early 2008 model MacBook Pro (17\") that went the way of all the earth a couple of days ago. I haven't diagnosed it fully yet, but it appears that it's the logic board that's gone, and if that truly is the case it's not worth it to spend the money to repair a nearly 3 year old machine (and no, I didn't have AppleCare because, apparently, I'm an idiot).\nThe question is this: besides the easily-removable RAM chips, what other parts could conceivably be scavenged from it and be realistically useful elsewhere? I haven't disassembled one of these before, I'm wondering how easily the hard drive could be removed and placed in an enclosure, for example (a zapped logic board should, theoretically, leave the HD data intact).\nAny other bits you'd keep before sending it to the great recycling depot in the sky?\n\nA: The memory and the hard drive are probably the easiest to remove and reuse. But there are plenty of parts that could be re-used including the keyboard, the display, optical drive and airport.\nThe site ifixit has a great guide to disassembling MacBook Pro machines.\nIf you do not have a need for the parts yourself, you may be able to sell them on eBay or elsewhere. I am not sure what the market is like for individual parts, but another option is to sell the machine as a whole on eBay stating that it is non-functioning and for parts. It would save you the trouble of disassembling it yourself.\n\nA: Depending on your level of confidence disassembling machines, you may want to look into buying up a similar model with a cracked screen on eBay or Craigslist. You can often get a 'junk' machine of that sort that works perfectly but has a broken display for 100 bucks or even less. Replace the display with the screen from your MacBook, and you can flip it for 3-8 times that, depending on the specific specs and condition of the machine.\nBeyond that, the Hard Drive should be easily removable and reusable in a variety of other environments. Most other parts will not be broadly useful outside of other MBP's.\n\nA: I wouldn't be so pessimistic if i were you:\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/661-4964-MacBook-Pro-17-08-Model-2-6-GHz-Logic-Board-/160562715302?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2562489aa6#ht_1145wt_1047\nJust find a qualified technician to do the repair. In any case it might be something more complex than the logic board, and my experience with apple service providers is that they usually shoot for the logic board without doing any real diagnostic.

Is there ANY way to Power Up a Mac Mini remotely?\nJust to be clear, I don\u00b4t mean wake up from sleep but boot up.\n\nA: Depending on how your Mac Mini is connected to the internet (wifi, ethernet, firewall, age of the machine, NAT, \u2026) it should be possible to do it using Wake On LAN.\nYou could, for example, use a GUI software like WakeOnLan.\n\nA: Not sure what you're trying to accomplish, but it's also possible to use the Energy Saver preference pane to schedule the machine to startup at a set time.\n\nA: As you describe it, no.\nYou could, however, get another computer or network-controlled device with the ability to cut off/restore power to a device, and remotely operate that (I'll try to find such a controller and link it here in a minute).  Then just set your mac-mini to auto-boot after a power failure.\nEdit: example- http://www.42u.com/dataprobe_iboot_remote_reboot.htm\n\nA: As a workaround you can set, in the energy settings a scheduled time for the remote computer to start. At least if others have powered down the computer you know it will power up everyday on its own i.e. 6:00AM\nI am setting up a remote MAC in the Philippines and others may power down instead of log off so I know if for example I set it to start everyday at 9:00PM philippine time it will be acccessable to me in the US everyday at 6:00AM.\nAnother idea if your in the US is to use iDevice, a switch that you plug into the power outlet then plug the MAC into. These are great devices that use apple home kit and I use them to power cycle my remote cameras that freez once in awhile and the company who makes the camera said to power cycle to restore the cameras. These devices use their own internet access and work great unfortunately they only make the 110 vac version.

{"text": "Q: What does the dynamic global hostname option in sharing settings do? Can anyone explain what this option does?\n\nA: The short story is this: when you see \"global dynamic hostname\", you are seeing the control for configuring a mechanism that Apple provides for making it easier to access your computer through a stable dedicated domain name on the Internet. But this mechanism has never worked well, since virtually no DNS hosts use it.\nThe long story is more involved.\nThere is another technology usually called \"Dynamic DNS\", which allows you to configure your computer so that it can be reached from the Internet, even though your computer is behind a home router. Being behind a home router usually obscures your computer's address from being visible to other machines on Internet. The way this technology works, is that you need to install a DynDNS client on your computer (or it is built in to your home router). That DynDNS client is always running. Every time your computer's address changes, the client tells a server what the new address is. Then other machines on the Internet can go to the server to find your computer's address, and can then reach your computer directly.\nThe upshot of all this is that the DynDNS client allows other machines to directly contact your computer via a stable domain name like \"JohnComputer.john.something.com\", even though your computer's actual address is hidden behind a router and is frequently changing. The benefit of this is it would make direct person-to-person communication services, like chat or screen sharing, easier to make and to use.\nThe keyword is \"would\". The problem is, even though dynamic DNS is relatively widely supported in routers, it is not widely supported enough that any popular communications service can count on it. Services like Skype and go2meeting that would benefit from it must instead build their own elaborate analogous server system in order to work. That's what they do.\nWhat does this have to do with global dynamic hostnames?\nWell, you remember how the technology called dynamic DNS is not widely used, even though it is relatively well supported in routers, and how it might also require installing a client on your computer?\nApple has for years implemented a competing, analogous technology called DNS Update. The client for it is built into every Mac, so you don't need to install anything! I believe Apple's Airport routers also have built in support for it (instead of the dynamic DNS system everyone else uses). And the great thing about DNS Update is that you don't need to rely on the oddball proprietary dynamic DNS servers for it to work. Instead, it's integrated with the normal DNS system, so you only need for your normal DNS host to support IETF proposals, RFC 2136 and RFC 3007. In many ways this is a much more logical system, as it integrates into the DNS infrastructure we are already using.\nThe downside is, I think there are only two consumer DNS hosts in the world that actually supports this system (Dyn/Oracle and ironDNS). So unless you're going to run your own DNS host, it is useless.\n\nA: For hostname read domain name such as apple.stackexchange.com, john-pc.local or localhost\nlocalhost is a static local hostname in that it is only accessible to a limited area (in this case a single device) and, by tradition, assigned to the same ip address: 127.0.0.1.\njohn-pc.local is (potentially) a dynamic local hostname in that while it will always refer to the same pc, the device's ip address will vary*.\n(* Well at least it will in most household wi-fi networks where the router assigns devices local ip addresses in a manner which means that the ip address might change from time to time by using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP for short. The same system is frequently used by Internet Service Providers to assign ip address to their subscribers.)\napple.stackexchange.com is a static global hostname in that it is accessible to the while world and semi-permanently* assigned to the same ip address: 198.252.206.16.\n(* The ip address can of course be changed but not as part of an automatic software process. )\njohndoe.acme-dns-provider.xyz is (potentially) a dynamic global hostname. It is accessible to the while world always points toward the same device but the ip address changes with the device's. Whenever the device's ip address changes special software on the device would log on the the dns providers server and update the ip address record.\n\nA: All computers running Mac OS X contain a feature called Bonjour. It works by sending multicast DNS packets out onto your current network to advertise your computer\u2019s available services. This is how iTunes Sharing works; your computer tells other computers that it has a shared iTunes library available, and gives the computers instructions on where to connect to it. Over the past few weeks, I have been experimenting with an extension of the service called Wide Area Bonjour. Instead of sending out multicast DNS packets to your local network, it sends out similar packets to an actual DNS server, which with the correct authentication, updates actual zones in the DNS server. This essentially allows you to use the magic of Bonjour across many networks, or even the Internet. All that\u2019s required is that each computer that is interested in your Bonjour domain has the domain listed in its \u201cSearch Domains\u201d (or \u201cDNS Suffix\u201d).\nThe service I have been testing out is Global Hostname, which will host a Wide Area Bonjour-enabled zone for you, either on your own domain, or a subdomain of globalhostname.org. Apple\u2019s AirPort product range feature Wide Area Bonjour to enable you to control your AirPort from wherever you are. \nAdded:\nIts purpose is to provide features similar to those offered by \"Back to My Mac\" without using the .Mac/MobileMe service. It requires that you have your own DNS server. If your service provider supports secure dynamic DNS update (RFC 3007), you can provide your Mac with a global DNS hostname so that other computers outside your local network can refer to it by name. Even if your computer\u2019s IP address changes at regular intervals, your computer will automatically update its global DNS hostname to point to its current IP address. Your service provider or domain administrator will provide you with the necessary user name and password so your Mac can update its hostname every time its address changes. If your service provider supports Wide-Area Bonjour registrations, you can also select the \u201cAdvertise services in this domain using Bonjour\u201d checkbox to advertise this computer\u2019s active Sharing services in this domain. If the domain\u2019s administrator enabled Bonjour browsing for this domain, other computers will see the services listed automatically in the respective application, based on the Search Domains entered in their Network preferences or based on information returned by DHCP. :)\n\nA: As far as GlobalNames are concerned it is a replacement for the WINS service that many Windows networks rely upon. \nOn a DNS server it is required to create SRV records and don't think this isn't a security risk. You still need to open ports through your routers firewall to enable the service to work.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1025", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "26"}}
{"text": "Q: Is it normal for it to take hours to delete a Time Capsule \"sparsebundle\" I'm trying to make room on my time capsule to make backups (it currently tells me it's full).  \nI got help in this question with how to delete individual backups, but it didn't solve the problem.   Even after I'd deleted all the backups Time Machine sees, I still have a ~700GB sparsebundle on the time capsule.\nSo, I'm trying to manually delete it, but it doesn't appear to be making progress.  I had this for about an hour:\n\nand then it switched to this:\n\nI realize that might seem like progress, but note the lack of blue filling up the progress bar.  It's been like that for hours now.\nIs this normal?  Is there a better way?\nNote that I really don't want to reformat the TC because I have other files that I've manually saved there, plus my wife's TC backups.\nEDIT: Nothing was happening.  It was apparently too much for Wifi.  Once I connected via ethernet, I was able to delete, but it took the better part of a day.\n\nA: It is theoretically possible if the drive is near full that a delete operation may take a lot of time. You can try to delete the file via the command line, which bypasses the Finder and does it the Unix way. \nIn any case there must be hard drive activity during the process. If the drive is not making any noise or light, then it\u2019s not doing anything and that\u2019s not good. But be patient. \n\nA: It is absolutely normal.  If you were to examine the .sparsebundle disk image that Time Machine stores data in, it consists of tens of thousands of files inside a sort of camouflaged folder.  Deleting an individual file takes a relatively short period of time, but that time adds up quickly especially when you're accessing those files over a comparatively slow interface like WiFi.\n\nA: Similarly to others, Time Machine made an excessively large .sparsebundle file (650GB) on my Seagate GoFlex drive, labeled .purgeable. Then Time Machine stopped backing up. Out of room. Purgeable file was never purged. Now I know to have at least twice the size of my original data available on the backup drive.\nI wanted to delete the .sparsebundle. Manual file deletion didn't work; the \"Deleting .sparsebundle\" process went on for 6 days, ending with the extremely unhelpful [ The operation can\u2019t be completed because the item \u201cbands\u201d is in use. ] Other forums suggested using Disk Utility or AirPort Utility to re-format; but neither app could see the wifi drive. \nOnly by going to the online GoFlex drive setup app was re-formatting finally a success. \nPART 1\nhttps://www.seagateshare.com/ - log in as admin\n\nPreferences > Administration > Storage Devices\n  Select the Hard drive, choose option Format and wait until it finishes. Even with a red error message, check the drive space result - mine worked anyway.\n  Presto - clean hard drive, all information erased as if unboxing for the first time.\n\nPART 2\n'OSStatus error' may appear when you try to assign the drive in Time Machine. Unbelievably, setting up a secondary account via the GoFlex Home app fixes it.\nGoFlex Home Agent > File > Open GoFlex Home > Preferences > Administration > New User\nJust don't use any previous user account credentials and don't really ever use this to log on to the drive.\nVoila. Drive ready to be re-assigned for Time Machine backup. \nCredit where credit is due:\nhttp://forums.seagate.com/t5/GoFlex-Net-GoFlex-Home/GoFlex-Home-filling-up-how-to-erase/m-p/78964\nSorry to those who don't want to re-format your drive. This solution is only good for returning the drive to zero. If you don't have a Seagate, but have a similar .sparsebundle Time Machine problem, perhaps your drive also has an online app re-format option at the manufacturer's site. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1028", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: Why is /tmp a symlink to /private/tmp? Why is /tmp a symlink to /private/tmp on Mac OS X? In other words, why isn't /tmp just a regular directory, like on Linux or BSD? I understand how it works and I don't mind it, I'm just interested in the (historical?) reasoning behind it.\n\nA: I have always wondered the same thing. I can't find any documentation to support it, but typically this pattern is used to make it easier to store files on another volume (e.g. hard drive). This allows the drive to be mounted (e.g. attached) into the file system in one place. For example when the drive is mounted at /private and then the folders /etc, /tmp, and /var are then all located on that other drive. \nWhat I can't say is why this would be beneficial. It is worth noting, however, that these three folders contain \"data\" files such as configuration, temporary, log, transient and database files rather than executable code contained in the /bin, /sbin and /usr folders.\n\nA: As I understand it, it's a holdover from NextStep (which OS X is based on), and NextStep did it to support NetBooting.  The idea was that you could boot from a network-hosted volume (probably read-only, and certainly shared with other computers), and early in the boot process mount a local (writable) volume on /private; as g mentioned, this allowed runtime-modification of /var and /tmp, as well as per-computer settings in /etc.\nThis isn't needed anymore, as Apple's current NetBoot system uses a shadow disk image to store changes anywhere on the boot volume.  But some programs/docs/etc now assume the files live under /private, so it'd be too much trouble to switch them back...\nUpdate: since I wrote this, Apple has stopped supporting NetBoot, so the original purpose of /private is even more obsolete. However, in macOS Catalina (version 10.15), they've added a new volume split. In this case it's for security rather than to support NetBoot, but it works in a fairly similar way.\nCatalina's system volume is mounted read-only, with a read-write volume mounted at /System/Library/Data (analogous to the old system that mounted a RW volume at /private), and \"firmlinks\" making parts of the RW volume appear at their usual locations in the filesystem (again, analogous to the symbolic links that make parts of /private appear at their usual locations). For example, /Users is now a firmlink to /System/Library/Data/Users. The Eclectic Light Company has a good summary.\nCatalina also still has the symbolic links to /private; thus, when you access /etc on Catalina, it follows the symlink to /private/etc, and then the firmlink to /System/Library/Data/private/etc\n\nA: Not sure about the historical reason, but OS X always \u201creorganized\u201d the typical Unix structure. /tmp is not the only thing that goes to /private, it also has /etc and /var. \nMaybe someone with more OS X background can come up with something more reasonable.\n\nA: /tmp is a symbolic lynk to /private/etc so as to maintain clearly separated 2 filesystems:\n\n\n*\n\n*/    which can be mounted as read-only, to protect it against\nany accidental or unwanted modification, and to protect it of being filled with always increasing files (logs and temporary files),\n\n*/private    which can be mounted as read-write, and which hold any directory containing modifiable files.\nIf you look at / you will notice 3 directories which are similar\nsymbolic links for this same reason:\ncd /\nls -al | grep '> private'\n\nThis separation of access between read-write and read-only filesystems\nisn't used actually (in MacOS X), but everything is in place to achieve\nthis security separation.\nSome admins are enforcing this security separation by defining a specific /private\nfilesystem with the appropriate size and appropriate mounting options\n(most notably nosuid).\n\nA: Frequently in Unix, identical ways of the same thing are because of historical differences between System V Unix and BSD Unix. Modern Unixes have to support both to be compatible.\nFor instance, lpr and lp for printing: lpr is from BSD and lp is from System V.\nWhether this is the case here, I don't know. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1043", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "45"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I sync my iTunes music library between two Macs for free? I have a desktop system that I use as a server. I also have a MacBook Pro that is my main computer. I've done a lot of organization and cleanup of my music library and have it all on my MacBook Pro.\nI'd like to be able to keep the music library on my MacBook Pro in sync with the desktop machine so that my wife can access everything from her own MacBook Pro.\nI thought about setting up folder actions that would copy the files into the \"Automatically add to iTunes\" folder.  However, since I like to use the \"keep my iTunes library organized\" option, the files get moved into the iTunes music directory and I can't write a script that will compare my MacBook Pro's iTunes music library with the \"Automatic\" directory on the server.\nAlso, a simple file copy will not sync metadata like ratings and plays. Is there a free, automated solution for syncing iTunes libraries between 2 Macs?  \nBelow is how I finally did it based on the rsync suggestion:\nI used the link provided by James in this answer (but I took out the --size-only option after the first sync): \niTunes Utility - Merging Libraries\nI also took out the --force option (because it's redundant when also using --delete). so my rsync command looks like this: \nrsync -av --delete ~/Music/iTunes/ /Volumes/robert/Music/iTunes > ~/Automation/automator/logs/itunes_rsync.log\n\nI then integrated this into an Automator workflow. Looks like this: Get Specified Servers \u25ba Connect to Servers \u25ba Run Shell Script \u25ba Eject Disk. \nCreating it as an iCal Workflow is screwy for me because I use MobileMe and the iCal event gets synced with my other machines where I don't want this workflow to run.  So instead, I created an agent using Lingon that runs the workflow every 8 hours.\n\nA: It's possible to keep libraries in sync using rsync. Google for iTunes and rsync and you'll find some solutions.\n\nA: How large is your library? Dropbox has helped many people in this situation, and it will work from anywhere.\n\nUPDATE\nDo you use only one computer at a time? Are you the only user of iTunes in each computer? Is your desktop a Mac with the same version of iTunes?\nIf so, observe this scenario:\nYou backup your desktop's ~/Music/iTunes folder and then delete it. You then copy the entire ~/Music/iTunes folder from the Macbook Pro to the desktop.\nYou have your laptop out of the house. You rip a new CD or download some tracks from iTunes or Amazon.com, etc. (but put a copy of the new song files aside in another folder temporarily), then listen, rate songs, etc. all day. Then when you get home, you copy the new files to the Automatically Add to iTunes folder on the desktop and iTunes does its magic of organizing the music files (just like on your Macbook Pro!) Then you replace everything inside the ~/Music/iTunes folder on your desktop with what's on your Macbook Pro EXCEPT the ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media folder (where the actual songs reside).\nVoil\u00e0!\n\nA: I have not tried this, but would like to some time: Mashduo. I found this via the excellent One Thing Well website: \"A utility for OS X that lets you compare two iTunes libraries, generating a report of songs that don\u2019t appear in both libraries and (optionally) making a zip archive of the missing tracks.\"\nSounds like some manual work, but may be another approach to achieve what you need. \n\nA: Soon iCloud will do this for you w/o all of that trouble.  Just connect up the libraries and presto (in theory).\n\nA: I haven't tried this yet (although I am going to soon) but I believe the newest version of Dropbox has a lan sync.  So that you can tell it NOT to backup your music over the internet (if it's larger than your plan allows) but keep them synced over the lan.\n\nA: You go to the little tab at the top that says \"iTunes.\"\nClick it, go to preferences. Then go to Sharing. Then click \"Share my library with my local library.\" Then click it to share my entire playlist on other home computers.\nand change whatever you want, then you should be able to access your entire library on all the computers that are registered in your home system.\n\nA: I use skydrive, its free and has 7Gb of space.\n1 - Create a hotmail or live account if you dont have it.\n2- Then go to skydrive.com log in and install the app. (also need to log in the app the first time).\n3 - On the PC or Mac, where you have the main music collection (i suggest to gather all your music to the same computer at first), then you create a folder for your music inside Skydrive's folder and past all your music there.\n4 - Then on itunes (reset itunes is HIGHLY recommended) go to \"Preferences\" > \"Advanced Preferences\" and choose as \"itunes media folder\" the music folder inside Skydrive. Also check both options \"Keep Itunes Folder organized\", this one is a must for to this to work so both Itunes (or more) can read your musics with no conflicts and the second options \"Copy files to Itunes Media folder when adding to library\" this one isn't a must but extremely useful because helps you to add new music to your collection, with this option ON you can simply drag a music from your desktop to your itunes with the option OFF you MUST put the music on the skydrive music folder.\n5 - For the other computers you want to sync the library, repeat step 2 and 4 (dont need to repeat step 3).\nThis works for windows and mac.\nThis works OUT SIDE of a home network\nYour computer will start syncing the second you turn on the computer just make skydrive to startup with the OS. So when you turn on itunes you will have your music there.\ncheers, berna\nEDIT: btw i dont recommend to use Home sharing feature, i try it out and duplicated all my music (In My Place 2.mp3) inside the skydrive folder...\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1045", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "20"}}

Using the volume buttons will adjust the headphones volume when headphones are plugged in.\nThe reason why these are separate is because sometimes you want to mute your ringer, but still want to listen to media (or vice versa), and because the headphone and internal speaker volumes are different and need to be adjusted separately.\n\nA: If you are trying to adjust the volume, but are only getting the option to adjust the ringer, push the home button while you are adjusting the volume buttons and it will switch to volume...\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1058", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}
{"text": "Q: Spotlight indexing appears stuck, what can I do? My Spotlight index got corrupted, preventing me from searching messages in Mail.app. I added my HD to Spotlight's privacy list to delete the index.

It's been \"Estimating indexing time\" for about 6 hours now.\nWhat can/should I do?\n\nA: You can try to temporarily disable Spotlight, removing its files and then reenabling it. \nThe process to do this involves executing Terminal commands, so please pay attention and triple check each step.\nOpen a Terminal.app (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and type: \ncd /Volumes\nls -l\n\nExamine the output of that, one should be your \u201cbroken\u201d Volume. Once you have it identified, proceed with these steps, all in the Terminal. The first time you execute a command, your password may be required, this is normal.\nThe output may look like: \nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root    admin     1 Sep  2 12:23 MacintoshHD -> /\n\nSo the name you\u2019re after is \u201cMacintoshHD\u201d.  \nStep Number One: Disable Spotlight for your Drive.\nsudo mdutil -i off \"/Volumes/the_name_you_have_identified_before\"\n\nStep Number Two: Remove the indexes from the Drive.\nsudo mdutil -E \"/Volumes/the_name_you_have_identified_before\"\n\nStep Number Three: Eliminate all Spotlight Files from the Drive. (two commands)\ncd \"/Volumes/the_name_you_have_identified_before\"\nsudo rm -fr .Spotlight-V100\n\nBe careful with the last command, make sure you type it exactly as it appears.\nStep Number Four: Re-enable spotlight in the Drive.\nsudo mdutil -i on \"/Volumes/the_name_you_have_identified_before\"\n\nNow this should trigger a Spotlight complete re-indexing. You have to be extremely patient with it. Spotlight sometimes appears to be frozen but it\u2019s really indexing.

{"text": "Q: How to install plug-in in Gimp on OS X? I've got the Gimp for Mac OS X installed and working in my installation of Mac OS X 10.6.4. A very important tool I need is the David's Batch Processor plugin ( http://members.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbp.html ) for batch auto-adjusting contrast/brightness/colour for my images.\nThere are no Mac specific instructions provided on the software's website saying how to install the python-based plugin. Can anyone please teach me how to install plugins for Gimp in Mac OS X?\n\nA: There are OS X instructions in the GIMP documentation and they suggest installing GIMP from fink or macports. Do this and you can follow the Linux/Unix instructions for plugin installation. Otherwise, the documentation states \"good luck\" if you install it some other way.\nHowever, searching http://gimper.net suggests that, for a Python plugin, you should put it in: [your home]/Library/Applications Support/Gimp/plug-ins (create directory if necessary).\n\nA: You'll find the appropriate folders at /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Gimp/. There go in the scripts folder\nand the presets go in the gimpressionist folder\nI found these locations by looking at the GIMP preferences, and clicking on Scripts. The locations cited above were listed there.\n\nA: I've managed to get DBP installed on my Mac (version 10.6.8). I've made the compiled plugin available on my blog, since compiling Gimp from MacPorts took an overnight compilation session, and is way too much hassle for folks who just want to plug-n-play.\nSo... anyone is welcome to grab my binary as they wish.

{"text": "Q: Slow transfer between iMac and Macbook Pro I've recently purchased a new Macbook Pro, and am attempting to copy files over my LAN from an iMac (both running Snow Leopard). I have about 100GB of data to transfer, and am finding I'm getting incredibly slow transfer speeds. For example, an 86MB file is taking about 7 minutes. \nIf I transfer this file from either the iMac or the Macbook Pro to a HP laptop running Windows 7, it takes about 60 seconds. Also, if I initiate the transfer of the file between the iMac and Macbook Pro on the HP (using Windows Explorer to transfer from iMac to Macbook), it also takes approximately 60 seconds. \nCan anyone offer any suggestions as to why the file transfers, when initiated from the Macbook or iMac using Finder, would be so slow? I'm not very experienced with OSX yet, so please be gentle with me :-)\n\nA: To transfer via FireWire, turn off one of the Macs, then when powering it on hold down the 'T' key. This will put the computer in Target Disk Mode and make that computer's disk available to the other computer. You can then just drag and drop between the two drives on the other computer.\nIf you connect the cable when both computers are powered on, your Macs will treat it like a network, assign themselves IP addresses, and use Bonjour to broadcast their sharing services. You will be able to connect via AFP/SMB/etc, but this configuration defeats the purpose of the firewire cable - you could just get a cat5e or cat6 ethernet cable and make the same connection, and it would be faster than Firewire in this case (assuming both Macs have gigabit ethernet ports)\n\nA: when you are telling LAN you mean wire or wireless?\nWhen you try to transfer files from iMac to macbook pro, what time transferring?\nalso\nit's not possible to copy data faster than the maximum read or write speed of the hard drives. Most hard drives are going to have a maximum sustained transfer rate of maybe 45-50 MB/sec (some may advertise around 80 MB/sec this assumes completely contiguous data. Throw some randomized head-seek time in there and that will quickly degrade to about half of the max theoretical speed.\nOver 100 BaseT (100 Mbps ethernet) then the network would become the new bottleneck and it would not be possible to get a transfer faster than 10 MB/sec (and more likely 9).\n If you're doing wireless. If it's wireless G then the max theoretical speed is 54Mbps (5.4 MB/sec) BUT... it's half-duplex. You'd be lucky to get 4 MB/sec.\nAlso what king of router do you have?\nPossibly sustained traffic can crashing the cheap router....\nSo as resume:\nUse Fireware800 or fireware400 cable to make this transfer as painless as possible\n\nA: I purchased a new router today (as it has been giving me problems), and this test file is now taking approximately 5 seconds to copy. So it was, as I suspected, a problem with the router after all. Thanks to all for the suggestions, and information regarding FireWire file transfer (which unfortunately I couldn't do, as the salesperson gave me the incorrect information regarding the type of cable to purchase).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1077", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

The foot under the lower left of the keyboard was attached with adhesive to the outside of the bottom case and further secured with an additional plastic ring running along the inside of the bottom case (this ring broke apart from the foot in addition to the adhesive failing on my machine).\nI went to the local Genius bar and the cost of the bottom case ended up being covered by apple care.  Even if apple care had not covered the bottom case, the bottom case was only $38.89.\n\nA: You can find a set of 4 replacement feet (along with other Mac replacement parts) at PowerBook Medic\n\nA: They sell the set of 4 here. You can also get a single foot.\nhttp://www.pbparts.com/shop.php//0761398.html\n\nA: You might be able to get some from Apple, I would try there first. Otherwise I do not believe there is an vendor for them.\nYou could consider molding some foam feet, or custom making your own. Otherwise just deal with it. I've seen several people who either made their own substitute or gone without.\n\nA: It has been a few years since I had to replace any of the feet on my laptops (the current ones are pretty well attached), but they used to provide them for free at Apple retail stores if you asked at the Genius Bar.

{"text": "Q: No video from Mac Mini, ONLY once OS X has loaded I have an old G4 Mac Mini, running 10.5. It's hooked up to a VGA CRT monitor using Apples DVI-to-VGA adapter that was included once upon a time. Last night, while using it, the screen flickered, and the monitor went to sleep, which is it;s default behavior when there's no display connected to it. Attempting to force the monitor on displayed a \"No Signal\" error. Restarting the machine does nothing.\nThis has happened once before. The last time this happened, I attempted to fix it by resetting the PRAM. After doing this, the Mac output the standard grey screen with an Apple logo on startup, but when the system reached the OS X login screen, the monitor flickers and goes black. Attempting to boot in Safe Mode provides similar results. The Monitor is old enough that it does not offer an \"Out of Range\" error for unsupported refresh rates, but I took a chance and attempted the Single User Mode directions found in this Knowledge Base article, to delete windowserver.plist files. The last time this happened (about 6 months ago), that worked perfectly.\nLast night, the same problem occurred, with the same symptoms. Does not display video in Safe Mode. Does display video in Single User Mode. However, after deleting the two windowserver.plist files, the machine is still unable to display video past the grey startup screen.\nIs there anything else I can try to fix this? Is the DVI-to-VGA adapter a possible culprit for a cheap fix? Or is my Mini in need of enough repair as to be better off replaced?\nEdit: It's definitely not the DVI to VGA adapter, sadly.\n\nA: The 1st thing you have to do is try to determine if it\u2019s merely a software issue with your OS install or if the problem relies on the hardware (whether it\u2019s the screen or the computer itself). \nIn order to facilitate that task, you must check the obvious. \n1) The DVI adapter (already tested).\n2) The Screen. Can you hook the monitor to another computer?\n3) Can you hook another monitor to the same computer?\nExtras: Have you tried another VGA cable? \nThe above should result in any of the following:\na) The screen is defective, change screen.\nb) The Mac mini has a hardware issue where no other screen works. Time for repairs (probably not worth).\nc) The Cable is defective, change cable.\nd) The screen works fine on another computer, the Mac mini works fine with another display. what\u2026?\nIn case of D, there could be a problem with the software instead, either the driver that the Mac mini is using when it detects the display is broken or the video driver or something. That\u2019s a whole new world and -as already suggested- you might want to try booting from the install CD/DVD and trying to see if video works there. Back up your drive and a full reinstall might also help you have everything fresh.\nHope it helps. I know it\u2019s a lot of obvious steps, but this is how the tech guys do it :) Find the problem first.\nUPDATE:\nAfter reading that the Mac mini doesn\u2019t work with a different screen and that this issue happens before login screen (i.e. it\u2019s not \u2018user\u2019 related), there are two possible ideas you can try before a complete OS reinstall.\nYou mention that it works in Single User but not safe mode; given that Single User goes straight to the command line, have you tried running fsck on the partition? Maybe there\u2019s some data corruption in the OS X volume. \nSafe Mode doesn\u2019t load external drivers and items in the StartupFolders, so that should work and I find it weird that it doesn\u2019t. Of course make sure you unplug all external devices (sans keyboard/mouse/display) before diagnosing a problem like this. \nIn any case, I\u2019d try to install a fresh copy of OS X on an external drive (if you don\u2019t want to wipe your internal copy) and see what happens from there. If the external copy works, then the OS X copy has a big problem. I know this is obvious (and it\u2019s already in your list of things to do) but sadly debugging a problem like this without access to the OS/hardware is really hard. You can always later clone the freshly installed OS X to your internal drive to avoid the reinstall in the internal drive.\nGood Luck!\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1117", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: Is it possible to reduce the disk space required to install Mac OS X 10.6? I was hoping to install Mac OS X on a flash-based drive I have, but it's only 4GB. The installer tells me there's not enough free space, but it doesn't specify how much I need free.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone know the exact minimum?\n\n*Is it possible to create a custom install with only the bare basics and install within 4GB?\n\n\nA: The minimum install that comes off the DVD is ~6 gigabytes. If you want to make a smaller install, the easiest thing to do is install it on another partition, trim down the installation, then copy it over to the target drive using ditto or Carbon Copy Cloner.\nThough I do not recommend doing any of these, there are a couple of thing installed in the default system that can be trimmed out to save space:\n\n\n*\n\n*All app binaries are installed 2 way fat (32 bit Intel, 64 bit Intel), and you can conceivably remove 32 bit Intel. The only Intel Macs shipped that do not support 64 bit userspace are the original MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and MacBook 2006. You can use a program like Xslimmer to do this.\n\n*All frameworks are installed 3 way fat (32 bit and 64 bit Intel, and 32 bit PPC). The PPC bits are there for Rosetta even if you do not have the emulator installled. You can remove PPC if you are not going to use any appc apps. Again, Xslimmer does this.\n\n*All Mac OS X installs include the complete set of drivers necessary for all Macs supported by that OS at the time it shipped. A number of drives may not be necessary for your particular Machine, and could be trimmed out, but doing so is moderately complicated.\n\n*If you have multiple localization installed you can remove them. Xslimmer can do this, as can Monolingual.\n\n*If yo are really gutsy you can build an mkext and delete OS X's drivers directory entirely. An mkext is a bundle of kexts generally used as part of netbooting, but the bootloader can use it to boot off a normal disk as well. It will omit any driver not needed to boot a system, and be trimmed down to a single architecture. On my system that would save ~300MB. If the full drivers aren't there, then some devices might not work, but anything needed to boot should be.\n\n*You can start deleting programs in /Applications, but the system assumes those are there, some stuff may not work properly.\n\n*Disk Utility by default leaves extra space for certain things on drives larger than a certain size. It is documented here. On a 4GB drive there there is ~328 MBs lost that way.\n200MB of it is for the ESP partition. The ESP is scratch space used under rare circumstances for the boot process. Removing it might cause difficulties installing firmware updates, but it probably won't, and you probably won't notice it.\nThere is also 128MB of unformatted space after the HFS+ partition. That is that there to aid in LVM operations (resizing partitions), and may be necessary in certain edge cases when running the installer (if the installer needs a chunk of contiguous space for something that is not a normal file during an OS upgrade, and it can't find the space within the FS it can extend it). You can probably get rid of it, but it might make it difficult to run the installer directly against the drive. Of course, given what you have to do to get 10.6 onto the drive, the odds that you could just run a 10.7 updater against when that comes out seem very low anyway.\nIn order to layout the drive this way you will need to hand build the partition map with the commandline gpt tool.\nHaving said that, the above will probably not trim down OS X enough to fit into a 4GB flash drive. Even if it did, OS X needs some temporary space (a couple hundred megs) to work, and by default that is on the boot drive. While it is conceivable you could write a boot script to find a drive inside the system and use it for temp space (point /private/tmp there, and setting the up the default pager), that is moderately complicated. I am guessing this is a recovery drive for a lab or something, in which case you don't want this install to perturb drives in the system it boots. If you need to boot on a range of machines it also means trimming out drivers is substantially more complicated and limited.\nUltimately, you are much better off just buying a 8GB flash drive. That is large enough to clone a normal installation, and will save you days of work.\n\nA: I don't know what the absolute minimum is. Isn't it written on the DVD box?\nHowever, there are obviously stuff that you can remove from the install to regain several hundred megabytes. I'm not sure you can fit Snow Leopard in 4 GB, though. 8 GB should be feasible.\n\n\n*\n\n*Additional languages and application architectures are not necessary and are pretty huge (string them using Monolingual or something like that);\n\n*The iLife apps (GarageBand, iPhoto, iMovie & iMovie HD, iDVD) and iTunes score more than 1 GB together;\n\n\nThere are probably many more you can strip off. My call would be to make another partition on your primary drive (maybe 15-20 GB), install Mac OS there and try to remove stuff until it gets under 4 GB. Then, copy it to your drive with Carbon Copy Cloner and it should be bootable.\n\nA: Another factor no one thinks about is how much RAM you have in your computer, because if you have 2GB RAM, a bootable USB drive with Mac OS X is going to create a 2GB virtual memory swap file on the drive. It will be stored in\n/private/var/vm/sleepimage\n\nYou can delete this file but the next time your reboot, it will be re-created. \nIf you run the same USB drive on a computer with 8GB of RAM, its' going to try to create an 8GB swap file. So your 4GB installation could balloon to 12GB of disk space the first time you use it.\nThere is a method out there somewhere to permanently disable the sleepimage file. This means that whenever you boot from the USB drive, it will only use RAM and will not cache the contents of ram to the sleepimage file. This might have an adverse effect on system performance, but you will be able to run your system on a smaller USB drive.\n\nA: I just scanned /Library and /System and /usr with GrandPerspective to find big files. Here is my findings:\n662 Mb /Library/Printers\n 52 Mb /Library/Fonts/STHeiti Medium.ttc\n 58 Mb /Library/Dictionaries/Shogakukan Progressive English-Japanese...\n382 Mb /System/Library/Speech/Voices/Alex.SpeechVoice\n 52 Mb /System/Library/Fonts/STHeiti Light.ttc\n 34 Mb /System/Library/Fonts/Aqua Kana.ttc\n\nIn total 1.2 Gb. I guess these files can be safely deleted if it's for an USB stick.\n\nA: When installing Mac OS 10.6 \"Snow Leopard\" you can click \"Customize\" and remove Printer Support, Additional Fonts, Language Translations, Rosetta, X11 and Quicktime. That eliminates 3+ GB and leaves 'Essential System Software' which requires 8.01 GB. \nIf you want to get it on a smaller drive you won't be able to use the Install CD. You'll have to delete even more and then make an exact copy. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1160", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

{"text": "Q: Adding MP3s to iTunes 10 doesn't work for some files I have recently upgraded to iTunes 10. I had some MP3 files which I would like to add to the library. In the past I have dragged the folder into the iTunes \"Library\" section which has added all the songs, but this time it only added the last two songs of a ~20 song album. Adding the files individually does not work either, and \"File > Add to Library\" does the same thing (only adds two of the songs).\nIs this a known issue, and is there a workaround?\n\nA: In many cases, improper tagging causes the files to go weird places. I suggest you create a smart playlist that shows you \u201cnew added\u201d stuff:\n\nI usually have the same problem with mp3 with dubious tagging.\n\nA: Upgrading for me made iTunes forget where the music library was (I use an external HD)... putting back the directory fixed it for me.... goto advanced settings, iTunes Media folder location, change... select media folder \"iTunes Library\". If you don't know where your songs are exactly then right-click on a song and \"show in finder\", that will give you an idea.\nI was able to add mp3's etc to itunes after that... :)\n\nA: It seems like the issue was related to improperly encoded files. I'm not sure if it was the container layout that was malformed or if the audio was incorrectly encoded, or even if it was just in a format that iTunes could not understand, but re-encoding the files as MP3 allowed them to be read by iTunes.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1167", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}
{"text": "Q: How do I install an application from a .dmg disk image? I've downloaded Firefox and it's now sitting on my desktop as Firefox.dmg. When I double click on Firefox.dmg it opens up a window with Firefox in it so I can use it - does this mean the application has been installed?\n\nCommunity Wiki'd the question because I think it's a worthwhile question to have on the site for pointing people to, it's not exactly intuitive to do and not a question I think I deserve any rep from.\n\nA: Usually applications that are distributed on .dmg files can be installed in different ways depending on how they are packed. After you double click on a disk image, I've observed these two common scenarios. It opens a window and:\n\n\n*\n\n*You see the application itself and a shortcut to Applications folder. You just need to drag the application and drop it in Applications shortcut icon. It gets copied to Applications folder and first time you run it, it warns you that it's the first time you are running the app and it's been downloaded from Internet. After you click on OK, it won't ask you that question again.\n\n*You see the application's icon (and sometimes some readme files that explains how to install or update the app). After you double click on the application icon, it starts an installer that walks you through installing the app.\n\n\nIn either case after you are finished with installing the app, you can right click on the disk image on the desktop and select Eject. The disk image will disappear but the .dmg file remains wherever you downloaded it. It's safe to remove the .dmg file then.\n\nA: DMG is short for disk image, a format which is commonly used in OS X to install a software.\nAnother possibility is to use packges (.pkg) which are installed using the OS X Installer.\nDMG Images are like customizable folders that cannot only contain the application itself but also other files. Most often, a custom background is used and you're presented with an option to drag/copy - and thus install - the application in OSX. That's it. You copy by dragging to...\n\n*\n\n*... /Applications to install for all users\n\n*... ~/Applications to install for yourself only (~ is the home directory)\n\n\nUninstallation\nAs you may guess, the uninstallation is done simply by dragging the application from it's current location in (~)/Applications to the Trash. There will still remain some related files (settings, cache,...) of that application on your computer, but they generally do not take up much space. You can use third-party software to help you automatically find and remove such data.\n\nA: Applications that are distributed on disk images (.dmg files) are designed to be installed using drag and drop. You can safely drag and drop the application from the virtual drive into your Applications folder and use it from your Applications folder. After copying it to your Applications folder it's safe to eject the virtual drive and delete the disk image file.\nNearly all applications will work just fine running off that virtual hard drive as they store their content in your user folder (eg. browsers, mail applications, etc.). It will however stop you from running application updates as the disk image is read only.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1171", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "18"}}
{"text": "Q: How do you find the UDID for an iOS device? How do you find the UDID for an iOS device on Mac and Windows?\n\nA: An alternative for those who don't actually run iTunes (yes there are alternatives) is to open the System Profiler, access the USB section, find the iPhone on the list of connected devices under the USB device tree.\nOn the iPhone listing there will be an entry that says serial number. This is not to be confused with the serial number listed in the General -> About section of the iPhone settings. The serial in the System Profiler is equivalent to the UDID.\n\nNote that on Lion, System Profiler has been renamed System Information and you can get the the USB information from the hardware portion of the System Report.\n\nA: This approach requires only a macOS device, the iOS device and the device's power cord.\nIf you have the iOS paired to the macOS device through wi-fi, you don't need a power cord and can skip steps 1 and 2.\nThis approach was based on macOS Catalina v10.15.5 and may not apply for other versions of the OS.\nSteps\n\n*\n\n*Connect the iOS device to an USB port of your macOS device.\n\n*If the iOS device asks for permission to trust the macOS device, grant it (assuming it's a device you trust).\n\n*Open the Finder app.\n\n*Go to the iOS device in the Locations section of the sidebar. It should open the device's page.\n\n*Click on the info section bellow the iOS device name on the top of the page until it displays the UDID.\n\n\nYou can copy the UDID by right clicking on it.\nSource\n\nA: You can follow the official how-to from Apple KB.\nThe same way works for iPhone, iPod and iPad.\nThe easiest way is to plug your iDevice, open iTunes, click on your device on the left panel of iTunes then click on the serial number. Your UDID will appear :\n\n\nA: While all the methods described so far require the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad to be connected to a computer, there are a large number of free applications available in the App Store to find the UDID without needing to do this (and, thus, effectively working on Mac, Windows, and indeed anything else).\nThe one I use and generally recommend to remote clients is Erica Sadun's Ad Hoc Helper (screenshot, etc., at below link):\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ad-hoc-helper/id285691333?mt=8\nWhich extracts the UDID and places it in an e-mail ready to be sent to whoever needs it, but a quick search of the iTunes store for \"UDID\" reveals half a dozen or so apps all intended to do this and any of which would do the job.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1174", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}
{"text": "Q: Why can't I resolve machine names on my LAN to their IP address? I purchased a new ADSL modem/router last week (Belkin Share), and can no longer resolve machine names on my LAN to their respective IP addresses under OS X. My Windows machines and VMs are able to do this successfully. If I ping the IP address directly, it succeeds, but if I attempt to ping the machine name I get 'cannot resolve . Unknown host'. My previous modem/router (DLink DSL-G604T) did not have this problem. \nIf I look at the DHCP leases on the router, the list includes the machine name, and this coupled with the fact that the Windows machines can resolve IP addresses makes me think this may be an OS X config issue (although I'm not experienced enough with it yet to know exactly what). I tried removing and re-adding the Ethernet connection under Network settings, but that made no difference. \n\nA: It appears the router doesn't support Bonjour at all (and Belkin support were totally clueless when approached about it), so I've returned it for a refund and am on the hunt for one that plays nicely with Macs.\n\nA: My Airport Extreme does this too. Try adding .local to the ends of the names of the machines you're trying to reach. This uses Bonjour to look up the names instead of your router's DNS, which should work if the computer you're trying to reach is a Mac. If it's a Windows PC (and using .local doesn't work) try installing Bonjour and seeing if that works.\n\nA: Just go to System Preference -> Network -> Ethernet/WIFI -> Advanced -> DNS.\nAdd in search domains \".local\" Apply and done.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1183", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: iPhone sync hangs on 1st generation iPhone I have a 1st generation iPhone which is suddenly failing to be able to sync with iTunes. It starts the sync process, but then part way through iTunes just hangs and becomes non-responsive. I have to kill the iTunes process to recover - even cancelling the sync on the phone leaves iTunes in a non-responsive state. The last status message in iTunes isn't consistent - sometimes it's copying an audio file from the phone, sometimes it's copying a video file to the phone. \nAny tips for getting past or diagnosing the problem?\n\nA: You seem to have tried all you can really do before proceeding to: \n1) Put the phone in Recovery mode and go from there:\n\nDisconnect your iPhone and turn it off by holding the \u201cSleep/Wake\u201d button for about five seconds and then sliding the red slider. If your iPhone is already off, there\u2019s no need to turn it on and then off again. Once it\u2019s off, press and hold the \u201cHome\u201d button and plug your iPhone into a Mac or PC with iTunes installed. Keep holding the \u201cHome\u201d button until you see a dock cable pointing to the iTunes icon. iPhones running older software will display a yellow triangle and text which says \u201cPlease Connect to iTunes\u201d. Once you see this image, you can release the Home button. \nOpen iTunes (if it\u2019s not already open)\n  and you will be told that \u201ciTunes has\n  detected an iPhone in recovery mode.\u201d\n  Click \u201cOK\u201d and you will be taken to\n  the iPhone pane. Click \u201cRestore\u201d and\n  you\u2019re done, it\u2019s that easy! Depending\n  on the extent of your iPhone\u2019s ills,\n  it may take some time to do a full\n  restore. Once you\u2019re done, you should\n  again have a perfectly working iPhone.\n\n2) If recovery mode doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s time to go to DFU (Direct Firmware Upgrade) mode: \n\nTo enter this mode, plug in your iPhone and turn it off. Hold down the \u201cHome\u201d and \u201cSleep/Wake\u201d buttons for about twelve seconds. You\u2019ll briefly see the silver Apple logo and then your phone will appear to turn back off. Release the \u201cSleep/Wake\u201d button but continue to hold the \u201cHome\u201d button until you see a message in iTunes stating that it has detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Choose \u201cRestore\u201d \n\nIt would be good if you tell iTunes to not auto sync:\n\nAnother idea is perhaps start with a fresh Library. Start iTunes by pressing alt and create an empty library in another folder in your hard drive. Try to sync from there. please note that this may wipe your phone if you\u2019re not carefully.\nIf after all this it continues to fail, you may need to go to a Genius bar, but if it\u2019s a 1st gen iPhone, you may be out of luck. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1187", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}
{"text": "Q: What apps/programs/daemons on OS X use my ~/.ssh/id_rsa* keys? I recently started using Git with GitHub and thus discovered that I already have a generated pair of SSH keys, public and private. This leads me to ask: what applications/programs/daemons on my Mac might have caused this keypair to be created? I've never used SSH to log in to another machine.\n\nA: Amusingly, your own question includes the answer. GitHub for Mac uses Git via SSH, and will automatically generate unprotected SSH key pairs (e.g. no passphrase) in order to push/pull contents between the remote repo and your local ones.\n\nA: The program to create SSH key pairs is ssh-keygen. \nEnabling the SSH daemon in the Sharing preference pane does not create a key pair for a user in ~/.ssh/ The SSH daemon only creates a SSH host key pair in /etc/ssh_host*_key*\nIf you haven't used ssh-keygen to create the keys, maybe some other program did it for you. I don't know which one does that but I haven't used git.\nAs for using the keys, every program that uses SSH can use the keys. Some, like ssh, use the keys automatically, in some, like Cyberduck (SFTP), you have to select the key file manually.\n\nA: To be honest the question is a little bit huge. Your ssh keys could have been generated if you activated the sshd (Remote Login) from the sharing preference pane; as to what could have used (or uses them), it\u2019s any program (like Git, Subversion, SFTP, etc) that requires ssh access. Not sure exactly which one could have generated for you, but you can always remove them and see what fails (save a backup!).\n\nA: Break out \nfs_usage(1)\n\nor\nopensnoop(1m)\n\nBoth of these commands have options to watch a directory, or a path.  Open a terminal and , well, watch ~/.ssh . See who actually accesses that path.  If you find a program that is accessing that path illicitly, then tell us all.

{"text": "Q: Some process is slowly taking over disk space...how do I find out what this is and how do I deal with it? I have a Mac Book Pro, first generation.  It is running 10.6.4.  I usually keep it running.  I put it into hibernation mode (i.e. it writes the state to disk and powers down) when I need to put it to sleep.\nI have a ~100GB hard drive.  Now I only have about 3.5 GB free.  I've noticed that recently i get the low disk warning quite a bit and when I check sometimes it dwindles down to a few MB.  I figured that it might have been my browsers (Chrome, Safari) caching stuff. I clear the cache and it frees up some space.  But I never get back to 3.5GB.\nSo, I decide to shutdown and restart.  Every time I do that I see that indeed I get back to about 3.5GB free.\nMy question is how do I figure out what is slowly eating up my disk space?  Have people out there experienced these symptoms?  What was the cause and how did you deal with it?\n\nA: It\u2019s a combination of the page file (virtual memory) and the hibernation file that gets written when you put your computer to sleep. Of course, other processes may also leave temp files that get deleted when you restart. There isn\u2019t really much you can do to improve that without affecting your computer\u2019s performance. \nYou can get a utility like WhatSize, Daisy Disk or similar to visually inspect the contents of your hard drive and see where is the \u201cabnormal\u201d file or directory. \nYou can also use Monolingual to reduce the size of your executables and remove unwanted languages and files.\nUpdate: \nThe virtual memory file is located in \n/private/var/vm\n\nand the hibernation/sleeping file in \n/var/vm/sleepimage\n\nPlease not that you can\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) delete the vm file while OS X is running.\n\nA: That is an accumulation of virtual memory and caches. The system will gradually consume a decent amount of disk space to perform optimally. This is akin to the scratch disk in Photoshop.\nThe only way to reclaim it is to shut down and restart. I would not go deleting page files or cache files in use by the system.\nYou shouldn't be running with 3 GB free. Move some stuff around, compress things you use rarely, and delete stuff that is just taking up space. Try to run with at least 10 % free if possible.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1209", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

I use FW800 out of the MacBook Pro into one unit, and then the pass-thru connector from that unit to the next one (each unit has a pass-thru connector; these boxes really were a steal at the price).\nI use one unit as my main 'projects and laptop backups' drive, and the second unit is my backup copy of the first one. I've been managing the backup copies using SuperDuper!, manually initiating a 'smartcopy' of the main drive to the backup drive at least once a week.\nThe disks I had in one of the units recently failed, and now I've bought 4 identical new 1TB Seagate disks. Before I set things up much as they were before (2TB in each unit), I was wondering if I could make a software RAID 1 unit out of them? I thought that this would be an easier system for me to manage than manually backing-up.\nHas anyone run a software RAID 1 drive on external drives like this? Is it worth the trouble, or should I stick to my current regime? I'm not looking to increase performance at all, I'm looking to minimise the human-involvement in my backup process. :-)\nThis would be on the current patch of Snow Leopard.\n\nA: A RAID setup is not a backup. A RAID is a way of mitigating hardware failure, its value is that despite a piece of hardware failing you can keep working with no down time. In your case, the issue you had a (a failed drive) would have been handled just fine by a RAID, but the following would not:\n\n\n*\n\n*Accidentally deleting a file (the RAID will happily delete it on both of the mirrored drives.\n\n*Data corruption due to bugs in any programs you are using (again, the RAID will dutifully store the bad data the apps send to it).\n\n\nThe above are software and user failures. If you are confident you (or an app) will never make a mistake where you need to rollback to an older version then you simply don't need a backup, and going to a RAID to mitigate potential HW failure is fine. If you are like the rest of us an make mistakes then you probably want actual backups, and to add a RAID in addition to that if down time is very costly for you.\n\nA: I haven't tried FW800 specifically but we use a lot of OSX-RAID1 on internal drives and i used it once on FW400.\nYou just have to create a mirrored disk set from the external disks in DiskUtility. You should use the whole disks and let DiskUtility do the partitioning. That makes it easier to rebuild and boot off the set.\nYou can also start out with data already on one disk, then create a degraded set on a second disk, copy everything over and integrate the first disk into the set but this requires some non-supported use of command-line diskutil. The same goes for creating partitions on the RAID set or creating a RAID out of partitions. (All of which is perfectly normal and handy on e.g. Linux)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1224", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

I'm looking for a combination of an app like RunKeeper that tracks my running speed, with an app (+hardware?) to track my heart rate.\nI'm currently running with RunKeeper (to track my speed) and also wearing an chestband+wristwatch (to track my heart rate). It would be nice to get rid of the wristwatch, if there's some app (and chestband receiver hardware?) to combine the data.\nI've seen some apps that only do heart rate monitoring, but I don't want to switch between 2 apps while running.\n\nA: There is Digifit which is software that works with any ANT+ enabled devices by brand names such as Adidas, Garmin, StarTrac and Timex.\n\nA: Runtastic has a solution for heart-rate sensor bands communicating with the Runtastic apps (which are similar to RunKeeper) via a sensor key which is attached to the iPhone: http://runtastic.com/en/sensors\nThe dongle is as expensive as for the Digifit, but the app is a lot more affordable.\n\nA: Wahoo Fitness\nYou might like to check out Wahoo Fitness - it's also an Ant+ dongle like Digifit, but unlike Digifit it works with a whole different ecosystem of apps (not just the default Digifit one) - defintely the widest range of all the apps you've listed here, and including Runkeeper as well so you don't need to change which running app you use.\n\n\nGood luck, and happy running. \n\nA: My friend, there is no need stop using Runkeeper!\nRunkeeper is fully compatible with great chest heart rate monitor - Beets BLU HRM! \nI use it with Runkeeper every day and I'm really satisfied.\nThere are also detailed setup insructions for Runkeeper on their  website: http://beetsblu.com/apps/app-store/runkeeper/\n\nA: I use Nike+ (iPod Nano and iPhone 3Gs+) to run and measure all my distances, they even have a website that you can control your running, join runners, do running contests, etc ...\nI'm very pleased with the entire solution.\nAnd they have a Polar Heart Rate accessory now that will also monitored your heart beat.\nthough Nike+ App needs a little update, I love it!\nP.S.

{"text": "Q: Is there a way to remotely restart Finder (or wake-up the desktop) from SSH? Over the last few months I've found my MacBook Pro is getting increasingly unwilling to wake-up if it's gone to sleep of it's own accord - not when I put it to sleep deliberately, but when the machine is left for a while and it eventually goes to sleep itself.\nI usually run it with the lid down, with a mini-DVI-connected 'main' monitor and then a USB-connected 'second' monitor. Sometimes no amount of keypressing, gently tapping the power button, disconnecting the external displays and lifting the laptop lid, plugging in USB devices, inserting and ejecting CDs - no amount of any tricks I've tried will 'wake up' the display even though the machine is running (shares available over the network) and I can SSH in. \nI can sudo shutdown -r now on the machine, though obviously that's a bit drastic!.

If not the finder, does anyone know of any other terminal means of forcing the machine to completely wake-up and return to it's previous state?\n\nA: This quits the Finder by sending it the \"quit\" AppleEvent, which is the same signal the system sends when logging out or restarting via the GUI:\nosascript -e 'quit application \"Finder\"'\n\nI (also) don't think quitting the Finder will fix the wake-from-sleep issue, though.\n\nA: You can restart the Finder from SSH using the command:\nkillall -HUP Finder\n\nI don't think this will help the wake from sleep issue however.\n\nA: this answer just cover your last question to wake your system compelety up.\nyou need do it with Wake-on-LAN protocot, it has sme GUI also. \nand also see this example:\nWaking up:\nThere are several utilities for waking up computers over the LAN.

A Spotlight search can look into your email messages from Mail (or other clients if they support Spotlight) while also looking into the contents of a PDF you downloaded and the file names in your Documents folder at the same time.

I'm new to Safari ... and would like to know if there is a way to cause Safari to inhibit the auto refresh function that a lot of pages seem to use these days.\nFwiw, my rationale is to stop large websites - being refreshed regularly - and hence consuming my download quotas. This is common with a number of news sites in Australia - eg. www.news.com.au\nI know there are ways to do this in Firefox, but I'd like to use Safari.\n\nA: Sadly (it happens to me too), most of these pages use either a Meta\n<meta http-equiv=\u201drefresh\u201d>\n\nor some form of Javascript to accomplish the reload every XX seconds. \nFor the former case, Firefox (not Safari) had an option to disable it (Tools >> Options >> Advanced >> General >> Accessibility ->  Warn me when web sites try to redirect or reload the page). \nHowever that option not always works, specially with newer sites; also that is a Firefox option only, which apparently you already knew about. \nIn the latter case (Javascript) there isn\u2019t much we can do.

Unfortunately pressing and holding g on the iPhone/iPad doesn't provide an option for the copyright symbol.\nAs an alternative, you can use glyphboard, or copy and paste the symbols from a note, email that you create on your computer.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> International Keyboards.\n\n*Activate the Japanese keyboard (whether you speak Japanese or not).\n\n*Open a text box in Messages, Mail, or Safari (or whatever).\n\n*Hit the globe button until it switches to Japanese (Kana not Qwerty) keyboard.\n\n*On the left hand side hit the second button from the bottom that says \"ABC\" until it switches to \"*123\".\n\n*Your keyboard should now have symbols on it.\n\n\nA: For a Pi symbol on iOS go to Settings \u2192 Keyboard \u2192 Keyboards \u2192 Add, then add a Greek keyboard.\n\nA: there's also another hardware keyboard that you can use. you have to do the same at the above and go to international keyboads.\nonce you get the international keyboards list, look for the one called Emoji.\nthen, whenever you need any miscellaneous symbols, tap the the globe until you get this keyboad with smilies.\nyou can swipe it to chose from the icons available, and if you need the \u00a9 or \u00ae (registered symbol), go to the one that shows \"!?#\", and it's all the way in the back.\nthe other icons in the bottom are for other icons for example the flower shows things of nature, while the bell shows other miscellaneous stuff you can find anywhere.\nAnd there you have it! \n\nA: I have copied the text here and entered it into my keyboard shortcut as phrase and made the text to equal uhh -  \u018f \u0259 \u00e6 \n\nA: install < pictokeyboard > from Cydia\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1345", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}
{"text": "Q: Can I use an iPad charger with my iPhone 4? Is there any harm in using the iPad charger for iPhone 4?\n\nA: The iPhone simply won't draw as much through the charger as the iPad would. Certainly shouldn't cause a problem at all (and my money's where my mouth is because we just have the iPad charger plugged in these days, using it for our iPad as well as our 2 iPhone 4s - we've been doing this for about 5-6 weeks now without any obvious ill-effects).\n\nA: No harm; you can use it. Straight from Apple (although last updated Oct 2011, so maybe not there when the question was originally asked and answered):\n\nThe iPad USB Power Adapter is a 10W charger. While designed for use with the iPad, you can use the iPad 10W USB Power Adapter to charge all iPhone and iPod models by connecting them using a Dock Connector to USB cable.\n\n\nA: When purchasing a mobile car charger for my iPhone4, I was told that iPhone4's and iPad's can share newer chargers with no problems. \n\nA: The rule of thumb on interchanging charging units is that the rated wattage for a given charger is considered the maximum that the charger can safely deliver, and not what it will deliver all the time.\nYou can have a thousand watt charger and so long as your phone needs less that that it all that it will supply it happily.\nWhere you can get unstuck is doing it the other way around.  If you charge your iPad over an iPhone charger, it will max out the circuitry as the iPad will want to draw more than the charger can safely do.  The charger should remain safe, but it will be operating at or close to maximum capacity, and this may shorten it's life, although so long as you are using an proper Apple one and not an eBay special the protection circuitry against overheating/overvoltage etc should stop it from burning your house down.  \n\nA: I prefer the 10 watt charger that comes with the iPad for my iPhone (4 and 4S) because it charges them faster than the small iPhone charger. I've been charging my iPhones with the iPad charger since getting my first iPad (1) a year and a half ago and not only is no harm done to the phone, it charges many times faster. I bought an extra 10 watt Apple charger that travels with me and bought one for my wife to use on her iPhone in her office at school. All work perfectly and quickly on both iPhone and iPad.\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/MC359LL/A?fnode=MTc0MjU4NjA\n\nA: yo can charge an iphone using an ipad charger but it will charge quicker and ultimately reduce the battery life\nBest advice is use the supplied charger that was with your device\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1352", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "9"}}

I understand that the battery life (even with WiFi) is fairly decent on the iPad. \n\nA: Killing apps manually will not affect battery life without effecting user experience.\nApps that stay active in the background typically do so for a limited time because they have a specific task that needs completing (like completing a download, or sending a mail message.)\niOS manages background processing aggressively in order to ensure that no extra battery is used unnecessarily.\n\nA: If you don't need to connect to a network turn off WiFi.

{"text": "Q: Anyone have experience with the Netgear DGN3500 or Linksys WAG320N? I need to replace my aging ADSL modem/router, and am considering the Netgear DGN3500 or Linksys WAG320N, as they both appear to have all the features I require (802.11n, ADSL2, Gigabit ethanet). I recently purchased a Belkin Share which also had all these features, but I had to return it as it didn't support Bonjour, meaning my iMac and Macbook Pro were not playing nicely on my LAN.\nDoes anyone here have experience with the above modem/routers, and can tell me whether they will work well in a LAN consisting of OSX and Windows based machines? I also have a variety of wireless devices (iPod Touch 2nd Gen, iPhone 4, PS3, PSP) that will need to integrate into the network.\n\nA: I had a Linksys very similar to that one and many other modem/routers (in fact a few days ago I had to get a new one and found a DLink) and never had any problem with Bonjour \u201cnot working\u201d or being unsupported. What do you mean by \u201cdidn\u2019t support Bonjour\u201d? Bonjour is a local protocol and unless you have different subnets within the same place and have a bridge/router in-between them, Bonjour is just like any other protocol inside your internal network.\nI\u2019m sure that either the Netgear or the Linksys are going to do the job fine. We have Window XP, Windows 7, OS X and Linux in our network. \nIf you expand your question to indicate what is your Bonjour\u2019s problem maybe we can help. \n\nA: I purchased the Netgear DGN3500, and so far so good. While its setup software only runs on Windows, its browser based interface has a setup wizard that does simplify configuration somewhat. \nOn the LAN side of things, everything appears to be working as expected, with no special config required. I am able to successfully resolve IP addresses via machine name, and AFP appears to be working. Other Bonjour driven features such as printer sharing and shared iTunes libraries also work. These are all things the Belkin Share wouldn't do (which is ironic, considering it DID come bundled with Mac software).\nNetwork performance is excellent, and is a definite improvement over the 10/100 LAN connection of my old modem/router.\nIn summary, this appears to be the Mac friendly modem/router I was looking for.\n\nA: I can confirm that the Belkin Share, Surf and Play routers do not support the Bonjour service, I have an email from Belkin support to that effect. The impression I got was that there was a hidden firewall that was suppressing the Bonjour multicasts between computers.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1368", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Using Spotlight to play iTunes songs causes another song to play after resuming from pause Spotlight allows you to play songs from iTunes. Unfortunately, when I pause the song and resume, iTunes goes back to playing what it was playing before I used Spotlight.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to fix this behaviour?\n\n*Are there any alternative methods of playing an iTunes song which I already know the name of?\n\n\niTunes Version: 10\nOS X Version: Snow Leopard\n\nA: Unfortunately there\u2019s no \u2018fix\u2019 for the described behavior that I\u2019m aware of.\nHowever, there are a lot of free/paid utilities that will not only do what you need, but also improve the experience overall. \nI could list you a dozen utilities but instead I will let you do your homework and decide what\u2019s best for you. This list contains an important amount of utilities for iTunes controlling.\nI can tell you which ones I use and my experience with them. \n1) Coversutra: It\u2019s a very well designed paid application. You can check their website for a more comprehensive summary (and a trial). The developer (Sophia) reads the suggestions and bug reports. \nPros: It\u2019s very good for searching, very good. Think of a spotlight music dedicated. You can easily switch between playlists, songs, artists, etc. All from the menubar. (I activate it with shift + cmd + space. It also has a controller where you can define your keys for showing album art, define song rating, next, prev, pause, etc. The typical controller stuff. You will rarely need the keyboard. \nCons: Although it has been optimized several times and results come extremely fast, scrolling the results is not as fast as one would expect. Sometimes certain actions might need a \u201cclick\u201d.\nAll in all, it\u2019s a product that works fantastically for me.\n2) Launchbar: I use Launchbar for everything, and sometimes for music too. Since it has iTunes support, you can easily type the name of a song/artist/list and will happily play it. What it does is create a playlist called Launchbar and whenever you make a selection, it adds the relevant songs to that list, therefore when you pause/play, things work normally. You can also do the same things (pause, play, next) from launchbar. \nPros: It\u2019s also very fast and it does a lot of things (can\u2019t live without it!)\nCons: Might be overkill for a song launcher/iTunes controller only.\n\nA: The solution is quite simple. Quit iTunes before you start using Spotlight to control it. Then it won't have anything else it was playing before to go back to.\n\nA: Why not just use the search that's built into iTunes to find the song by name? It's much faster than Spotlight, and doesn't have the problem you describe:\n\nIf you have your heart set of continuing to use Spotlight, then my best guess is that when you 'pause' the song, you're actually stopping it. Next time you play a song through Spotlight, open up the iTunes window and see if the button is to pause the playing media, or to stop it.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1378", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

Sometimes these are resolved by rebooting the router, sometimes not. Sometimes rebooting the phone fixes it, sometimes not. \nDo people have similar problems with Apple products?

No additional battery should be used until the iPod is powered up again.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1390", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: Are my permissions for /usr/local/ correct? I\u2019m using HomeBrew for my port needs (seems a bit \u201ccleaner\u201d than MacPorts).\nI can install without sudoing (which is great), but the man linking step seems to require it (/usr/local/share/man/man3 is owned by root).\nA guide I found suggests I recursively chown /usr/local by doing\nsudo chown -R `whoami` /usr/local\n\nIs this safe\u2026or is it a Bad Idea\u2122?\nAlso: are my permissions correct?\n$ pwd\n/usr/local/share/man\n$ ls -lah\ntotal 32\ndrwxrwxr-x    8 root  staff   272B  4 Set 11:02 .\ndrwxrwxr-x    9 root  staff   306B 10 Set 11:27 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x    3 root  wheel   102B  4 Ago  2009 de\ndrwxrwxr-x  163 root  staff   5,4K 10 Set 11:27 man1\ndrwxr-xr-x   11 root  wheel   374B 10 Set 11:27 man3\ndrwxr-xr-x    7 ago   staff   238B 10 Set 11:39 man5\ndrwxr-xr-x   11 ago   staff   374B 10 Set 11:39 man7\n-rw-r--r--    1 root  staff    13K  4 Set 11:02 whatis\n\n\nA: For what it's worth, /usr/local is not considered a \"system\" folder by OS X, and on a brand new Snow Leopard install that folder is empty.\nAny root-owned stuff in that folder is a result of sudo make install on other software, or giving your password after double-clicking on a .pkg that wants to dump stuff into /usr/local.\nOwning /usr/local has \"worked for me\" on 2 machines for over a year.\nOne gotcha is that if you've installed MySQL (not using Homebrew) and chown its files, then it probably won't be able to see its databases anymore (so you'd have to chown them back to whatever user MySQL is running as.)\n\nA: As in Homebrew 1.0.0:\n\nHomebrew no longer needs to have ownership of /usr/local. If you wish\n  you can return /usr/local to its default ownership with:   sudo chown\n  root:wheel /usr/local\n\n\nA: I use Homebrew too and can confirm it's totally safe. Quoting the Installation page on the official Homebrew FAQ:\n\nDo yourself a favour and pick /usr/local\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*It\u2019s easier\n/usr/local/bin is already in your PATH.\n  \n*It\u2019s easier\n  Tons of build scripts break if their dependencies aren\u2019t in either /usr or /usr/local. We fix this for Homebrew formulas (although we don\u2019t always test for it), but you\u2019ll find that many RubyGems and Python setup scripts break which is something outside our control.\n  \n*It\u2019s safe\nApple has conformed to POSIX and left this directory for us. Which means there is no /usr/local directory by default, so there is no need to worry about messing up existing tools.\nIf you plan to install gems that depend on brews then save yourself a bunch of hassle and install to /usr/local!\nIt is not trivial to tell gem to look in non-standard directories for headers and dylibs. If you choose /usr/local, everything \u201cjust works!\u201d\n\nI'll just add that doing things as root is a very bad idea, so chowning /usr/local not only seems reasonable to me (it's not a system dir on OSX), but sane.\nYour permissions are not correct (yet). Just run the command you listed and you're gonna be fine.\nIf you have other problems remember, the brew doctor can help you!\n\nA: It is usually better to keep permissions as strict as possible. Keeping /usr/local owned by root means that only processes that run as root/sudo (or ask for admin user via the Apple authorization dialog box) can write to this area. Thus, a process download has to ask you for a password before corrupting files there.\nBut as you say, it makes adding new programs harder.\nI am OK with running sudo, as you install things less often than running them but you have to trust that the build process does not change anything it should.\nIf you want to avoid sudo I would install Homebrew into ~/usr/local and alter your path, manpath etc to include the directories under there. \nA better way is to create another user\u2014say, homebrew and create a directory owned by that user. Then, install there using sudo -U homebrew. Other users will have the benefit of not being able to overwrite any other files, because they are not running as root  and other programs cannot affect homebrew. (I note that the Homebrew FAQ does suggest this new user if you are in a \"multi user environment\". I would say that any Unix machine including macOS is a multi user environment)\nHowever as the Homebrew wiki says the recipes don't find all cases of /usr/local and replace them with the chosen directory I suspect we are stuck with /usr/local. \n\nA: As of macOS High Sierra or later, /usr/local can no longer be chown'd.\nThe Homebrew team now recommends: sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/* to fix Homebrew permissions.\nSee @Carmine Paolino's answer for more info on why Homebrew recommends taking ownership of the Homebrew directories.\n\nA: If you're using Homebrew, you should give the write permission to specific group (either admin or staff), so the files can be shared between users who are in that group.\nFor example:\nsudo chgrp -R admin /usr/local /Library/Caches/Homebrew\nsudo chmod -R g+w /usr/local /Library/Caches/Homebrew\n\nThen assign the users who should have access to brew command to that group (check your groups via: id -Gn).\nThen when working with brew, do not run it with sudo.\nWhen still having some permission issue, run brew doctor to troubleshoot the problem.\n\nA: I think it's OK for users to have write permissions to /usr/local -- after all, that means you're not using sudo on every build script. I don't like the idea of an ordinary user owning /usr/local. I'd prefer to have root (or similar) own /usr/local, but change the permissions so that users (or at least some privileged group) can write to it. That seems like the conceptually correct approach.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1393", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "99"}}
{"text": "Q: What cool things can you do if you hack EFI I think I'm right in thinking Intel Macs use EFI.\nI heard rumours that you can create low-level password protection and even install a shell. Info is sparse and limited.\nHave any power users hacked their Mac EFI? If so, what did you do and how?\n\nA: Yes, you can install a shell. You can also setup a firmware password, though you generally use utilities that run under Mac OS X to set it up (Apple include's Firmware Password Utility on the install DVD, but does not actually lay it down on the system partition).\nEFI is probably less interesting from an hobbyist perspective than OpenFirmware was. Even if you install an EFI shell, you only have access to a limited scripting environment (basically akin to bash), unlike OpenFirmware where you could actually write substantial things directly in Forth (up to and including writing boot drivers directly at the console without a separate OS and toolchain).\nIn order to do anything serious with EFI you need to build a cross compile toolchain to compile to native code or EBC, and once you do that you might as well just compile a standalone binary and make it look like a boot vector and just have the firmware boot your code like an OS.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1399", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

Biggest downside is the titles of the pdf's are not shown so if the first page isn't the title you have no idea what you are looking at in iBooks.

{"text": "Q: Why are Firefox and Safari having problems with certain PDF files on the web? I'm having fits with a certain web PDF document using both Firefox and Safari.  Basically the document in question doesn't consist of one big pdf file; rather it consists of a bunch (20 or so) smaller files, one for each chapter or section, and the main page has file links to each of them.  In Firefox on a PC, clicking on the link for section 22 simply opens that PDF in the existing in-browser window.  In Safari or Firefox on Mac... it doesn't do anything - I can't navigate to or view section 22.  Similarly, downloading the individual files and saving them doesn't seem to work very well either, though I am thinking of downloading them and trying to re-create locally the directory/file structure the links seem to expect - still kind of a PITA.\nLink to PDF document\nDoes anyone know of any browser add-on or other tool that could be used to view something like this on a Mac?\n\nA: Adobe's Safari plugin for their PDF Reader doesn't work in 64 bit mode (and they don't supply a Firefox/Mac plugin at all!).\nTry this Adobe kb article to see if setting 32-bit mode for Safari will work for you.  I had similar isses a while back, and I had to reinstall Reader (after upgrading to Snow Leopard) after doing this tip.\n\nA: There are some PDFs that the built-in PDF viewer can not handle - mostly using newer features available in Adobe Acrobat or linking to remote content. (This does not appear to be the case)\nOne option is to download and install Adobe Reader for Mac OS X which can handle these PDFs correctly. It will also install an Internet Plug-in to hand off handling of PDFs to the Adobe Reader program but you will notice a significant delay in the loading of PDFs.\nThe other workaround is download the other PDFs directly from the following URL:\nhttp://www.nrahq.org/compete/RuleBooks/HPR/hpr-w##.pdf (replace the ## with 01 through 22 for each section and the ## with \"Illustra\" for the Illustration page and the w## with \"apdx\" for the appendix).\n\nA: I think the issue is the way the Mac PDF viewers display links to files vs. links to URLs.\nI opened your PDF in Acrobat Pro X and can see the links have an action of opening a file instead of a URL.\nModify the link properties to specify an action of \"Open a web link\" instead of \"Open a file\" and the links should work in the browser.\nI modified your hpr-index.pdf and changed one of the links to open the URL: http://www.nrahq.org/compete/RuleBooks/HPR/hpr-w03.pdf\nViewing the file in Safari using the native PDF viewer opened the correct file when clicking the link in the PDF.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1434", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: Why is my MacBook Pro quitting and/or failing to start up? This is an issue that started today. \nLast night I shut down the machine. This morning I switched it on and got the initial sound but not the chime. The sleep indicator light would blink in groups of 3 blinks. I checked the battery. And also tried some tips on the Apple site for troubleshooting a MBP that won't turn on. Anyway, after looking at a couple of forums, I wound up removing and re-seating the memory. Ok, then it works for about 45 minutes, but then the screen went black and again the 3-blinks of the sleep light. \nWhat should I try next in troubleshooting this machine? \nI have had no problems in terms of performance or other issues til today. The MBP is from early 2008. There was an iTunes update yesterday and otherwise no new software or updates. Also no external devices plugged in. \nHowever it did have the power supply connected. I did notice this morning that the power supply had come loose from the power strip -- possibly caused by a cat. This is the only thing that seemed to be a variance from usual.\nThanks.\nAnyone?

{"text": "Q: Is it possible to merge two iTunes Store accounts so we can share apps and other purchases? My wife and I each have iTunes on our PCs.  Originally, I set these up with separate iTunes Store accounts.  I was led to believe that we ought to do this because an email address is used for the Apple ID, and we each have one.  I'm thinking now that was a mistake?\nHere's the problem:\nEach of us now has an iPad, and we're each buying apps on our own accounts and syncing to our own PCs.  Because of these separate accounts and iTunes PCs, I understand we're unable to share our purchases \u2013 which, AFAIK, Apple expressly permits on up to 5 associated family devices.  (Please correct me if I'm wrong.)\nIs it possible to merge or consolidate two different Apple iTunes Store accounts so we can share the apps and other purchases we've made?  (We are married, so legally it is community property anyway! :-)\nAlternatively, is there a way we could maintain our separate accounts but still sync each others' devices in a way to get both sets of apps on each iPad?  We've already made some redundant purchases (and thus wasted some $) and I'd like to avoid that in the future, if possible!\n\nA: Another suggestion -- you can authorize itunes on your computer to play content from your wife's account (\"iTunes -> Store -> Authorize Account\") as well as your own.\nAnd you can do the same for itunes on your wife's computer.  \nThis will allow you to play both you and your wife's content on both of your computers.  However, this way you will have to duplicate the content on both computers.\n\nA: The way me and the wife have got around this is to use two accounts but have the same password so we don't have to remember a different password. This way, when you come to update your apps, it doesn't matter which account pops up, it will be the same password. \nWe also have a third account. Mine, hers and shared. \nThis is because I have had mine for years and so has she. Then when we got married we decided to create joint account so we don't have to worry about potentially buying an app twice and it will also automatically sync between our 2 iPhones and our two iPads. Again, using only one password for 3 accounts. Ultimately, in a few years any older apps wont be required and we'll mainly use the joint account. Also, all three accounts are on the same debit card.\n\nA: Home sharing should allow you to see each other's libraries over your home network, and drag apps from your wife's onto yours and vice versa.  You can definitely do this despite having two accounts - my wife and I have a similar problem.  You may have to enter both passwords from time to time to authorize purchases, though.\n\nI found some help setting this up from \"Activating Home Sharing in iTunes\".\nI believe you can also sort hers by \"items I don't have\" so you can see what she might have bought of interest to you, although I'm not sure you can automatically sync them.\nThis SuperUser question seems to suggest that merging two accounts is not an option:\nCan I merge 2 iTunes Store accounts?\n\nA: Even as of 2017 it is still not possible to actually merge two accounts, however, since 2014, with the release of iOS 8 and OS X 10.10 Yosemite it is possible to set up Family Sharing. \nFamily Sharing enables shared usage/download of all members of the family's purchased Music Books & Apps & will also set up a dedicated shared calendar which can optionally be used to notify members of upcoming events etc.\nPersonal data is not shared, only the 'right' to use apps/music/books previously purchased by any member & henceforth purchased under the family membership.\nOne account will be designated Family Organiser - and all purchases in future will be charged to the organiser's account - others can be designated as Adult or Child, with parental controls over what data can be used with or without explicit permission from an Adult.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1460", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "25"}}
{"text": "Q: What is the chance that jailbreaking my iPhone will brick the phone? How does it actually work? Does it change just the firmware on the main filesystem? Does it touch the bootloader?\nI'm trying to figure out what's probability of\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone jailbreak bricking the phone\n\n*Apple's update bricking the jailbroken iPhone (In the line with those questions, does Apple's update simply overwrites the flash partition with the new one and then applies the backed up data?)\n\n\n\nEdit: should probably mention it's a 3GS with 4.1 firmware.\n\nA: Jailbreaking utilizes an exploit in the OS (or in the latest cast, the boot ROM), and injects the payload onto the phone, which is usually a loader to install Cydia, or Cydia itself.  Cydia is the source for applications not in the App Store, and once this is loaded, other software can be installed which could modify system files.  One such case is Winterboard, which allows you to customize aspects of the UI.\nWith regards to question 1:\nIt depends on what happens during the jailbreak.  If, for example, you're running the exploit to jailbreak the phone and the battery dies (or the software malfunctions), there's a chance you'll brick it.  It's hard to pin a percentage on it.\nWith regards to question 2:\nSince Apple is expecting their software to be running on the phone, it may do some things that could brick the phone.  Again, it definitely varies on what has been changed, how the jailbreak was performed, etc.  Personally if Apple comes out with an iOS update, I'm not going to just allow it to run.  If I want it, first thing I'd do is restore the original firmware via iTunes.\n\nA: Jailbreak means replacing the content of the boot.\nSo, everything is changed. It's like a new harddrive with a new boot image on it, changing everything in that hard drive since how it start's, to host the actual Operating System that in Jailbreak devices is an altered OS so all methods, functions and properties are available without any restrictions.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1462", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I move virtual memory swap files to a different drive or partition? note: This is a question that I asked on SuperUser a while ago. I'm re-posting it here because I think it belongs here.\nBy default, Mac OS X stores its swap files in /private/var/vm/. I would like to place the swap files in a different location. How can it be done?\n\nA: I have been unable to establish a permanent system boot solution, since 10.10 no longer uses /etc/.rc at boot, and the com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist method has failed.... however...\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/Swap/s\nsudo chmod 755 /Volumes/Swap/s\nsudo sysctl vm.swapfileprefix=/Volumes/Swap/s\n\ndoes change the stored prefix as reported by \nsysctl vm\n\nfor the duration of the session, and it survives reboot. \nthis could be wrapped as a unix command into a text file:\n$/bin/sh\nsysctl vm.swapfileprefix=/Volumes/Swap/s\n\nand run at login.\n\nA: note: copied from SuperUser:\nFor older versions of OSX, see this thread on forums.macosxhints.com.\nCredit goes to dblu for explaining the use of plutil, ZILjr for introducing the wait4path command, and ekl for simplifying the whole thing by eliminating the need for an intermediate shell script.\nComplete solution:\n1.  Open Terminal and make a backup copy of Apple's default dynamic_pager.plist:\n$ cd /System/Library/LaunchDaemons\n$ sudo cp com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist{,_bak}\n\n2.  Convert the plist from binary to plain XML:\n$ sudo plutil -convert xml1 com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\n3.  Open the converted plist with your text editor of choice. (I use pico, see dblu's answer for an example using vim):\n$ sudo pico -w com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\nIt should look as follows:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs$\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>EnableTransactions</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>HopefullyExitsLast</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.apple.dynamic_pager</string>\n    <key>OnDemand</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/sbin/dynamic_pager</string>\n        <string>-F</string>\n        <string>/private/var/vm/swapfile</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n4.  Modify the ProgramArguments array (lines 13 through 18) to use the wait4path shell command prior to launching dynamic_pager. See note #1 for details on why this is necessary. In the following example, my partition is called Swap, and I chose to put the swapfiles in a hidden directory on that partition, called .vm be sure that the directory you specify actually exists. The XML should look as follows:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/bin/bash</string>\n    <string>-c</string>\n    <string>/bin/wait4path /Volumes/Swap/ &amp;&amp;\n/sbin/dynamic_pager -F /Volumes/Swap/.vm/swapfile</string>\n</array>\n\n5.  Save the plist, and return to the terminal prompt. Using pico, the commands would be:\n<ctrl+o> to save the file\n<enter>  to accept the same filename (com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist)\n<ctrl+x> to exit\n\n6.  Convert the modified plist back to binary:\n$ sudo plutil -convert binary1 com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\n7. Restart your Mac. If you run into trouble, switch to verbose startup mode by holding down Command-v immediately after the startup chime. This will let you see all of the startup messages that appear during startup. If you run into even worse trouble (i.e. you never see the login screen), hold down Command-s instead. This will boot the computer in single-user mode (no graphical UI, just a command prompt) and allow you to restore the backup copy of com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist that you made in step 1.\n8. Once the computer boots, fire up Terminal and verify that the swap files have actually been moved:\n$ cd /Volumes/Swap/.vm\n$ ls -l\n\nYou should see something like this:\n-rw-------  1 someUser  staff  67108864 18 Sep 12:02 swapfile0\n\n9. Delete the old swapfiles:\n$ cd /private/var/vm\n$ sudo rm swapfile*\n\n10. Profit!\nNote 1\nModifying the arguments to dynamic_pager in the plist without using wait4path does not always work, and when it fails, it does so in a spectacularly silent way. The problem stems from the fact that dynamic_pager is launched very early in the startup process. If your swap partition has not yet been mounted when dynamic_pager is first loaded (in my experience, this happens 99% of the time), then the system will fake its way through. It will create a symbolic link in your /Volumes directory which has the same name as your swap partition, but points back to the default swapfile location (/private/var/vm). Then, when your actual swap partition mounts, it will be given the name Swap 1 (or YourDriveName 1). You can see the problem by opening up Terminal and listing the contents of your /Volumes directory:\n$ cd /Volumes\n$ ls -l\n\nYou will see something like this:\ndrwxrwxrwx  11 yourUser  staff   442 16 Sep 12:13 Swap -> private/var/vm\ndrwxrwxrwx  14 yourUser  staff     5 16 Sep 12:13 Swap 1 \nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root      admin     1 17 Sep 12:01 System -> /\n\nNote that this failure can be very hard to spot. If you were to check for the swapfiles as I show in step 12, you would still see them! The symbolic link would make it seem as though your swapfiles had been moved, even though they were actually being stored in the default location.\nNote 2\nI was originally unable to get this to work in Snow Leopard because com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist was stored in binary format. I made a copy of the original file and opened it with Apple's Property List Editor (available with Xcode) in order to make changes, but this process added some extended attributes to the plist file which caused the system to ignore it and just use the defaults. As dblu pointed out, using plutil to convert the file to plain XML works like a charm.\nNote 3\nYou can check the Console application to see any messages that dynamic_pager_init echos to the screen. If you see the following lines repeated over and over again, there is a problem with the setup. I ran into these messages because I forgot to create the '.vm' directory that I specified in dynamic_pager_init.\ncom.apple.launchd[1]  (com.apple.dynamic_pager[176]) Exited with exit code: 1\ncom.apple.launchd[1]  (com.apple.dynamic_pager) Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 seconds\n\nWhen everything is working properly, you may see the above message a couple of times only, and then no more of the \"Throttling respawn\" messages. This means that the system did have to wait for the partition to load, but in the end it was successful.\nExclude the path from Time Machine\nIn OS X 10.7 and later you can do this with tmutil. Example:\nsudo tmutil addexclusion -p /Volumes/Swap/.vm\nFor that example, to review the result:\ntmutil isexcluded /Volumes/Swap && tmutil isexcluded /Volumes/Swap/.vm\nIf the volume used for swap need not be indexed\nUse mdutil. Example, to switch off then erase the store:\nsudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/Swap && sudo mdutil -E /Volumes/Swap\n\n\nA: Simple solution:\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/10771/swap-relocator\nSwapRelocator 1.1.2 works great on Maverick!\nUse (for example) Tinker Tool System to let volumes mount before log-in, that solves the only problem I encountered.\n(Thanks Filippo, I can finally move the swap from the mirrored boot volume to a striped cache volume (all SSD))\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1465", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "37"}}

This is started to be really annoying to me\nIf you have an original folder with 2 files and you copy something into it's parent folder where the folder name is the same, and, let's imagine you are copying 3 files and at the end you want to end up with 5 files, let's make an example, like:\nOriginal:\n~/User/abc/Documents/locale/fileA\n~/User/abc/Documents/locale/fileB\n\nStuff you want to copy:\nlocale/fileC\nlocale/fileD\nlocale/fileE\n\nWhen you copy it into ~/User/abc/Documents/ you get this:\n\nThere is no option to COPY / MERGE ! if you press REPLACE you will end up with:\n~/User/abc/Documents/locale/fileC\n~/User/abc/Documents/locale/fileD\n~/User/abc/Documents/locale/fileE\n\ninstead of \n~/User/abc/Documents/locale/fileA\n~/User/abc/Documents/locale/fileB\n~/User/abc/Documents/locale/fileC\n~/User/abc/Documents/locale/fileD\n~/User/abc/Documents/locale/fileE\n\nWhat is going on here? How can I simple merge the stuff I want with the existing one. Like Transmit asks\n\n\nA: I believe it's because of Mac OS X way of handling certain packages.\nFor instance, an application. To the user, it's just an .app file, you double click it and it opens the app.\nBut really, it's a folder with .app extension, with a hierarchy like this:\n\nYou can see that for yourselves by righ-clicking the app and choosing \"Show Package Content\".\nThe only reason I see for Apple not to allow merge on folder is that they didn't want to confuse the user. Like asking to merge when all you want is updating an application.\nAnd since it's a standard way to represent packages on a Mac OS X system, they didn't bother trying to differentiate between packages and simple folders.\n\nA: Most probably too late for all your replaced files, but copy the folder (Option \u2325 + C) and then paste the items (Option \u2325 + V), it will then ask to merge\n\nA: Whip out your trusty terminal and and do:\nprompt>cp -R locale ~/User/abc/Documents/\n\n\nA: We (the OS X users) have been asking ourselves that question since the age of dawn.\nVery well phrased question to a sad response: OS X doesn\u2019t do that and can\u2019t do it without 3rd party tools.\nOf the 3rd party alternatives there are a lot, I\u2019ll just go ahead and recommend what I think it\u2019s the best alternative to Finder, but\u2026 your mileage may vary. \nPath Finder by CocoaTech is not a free alternative (far from it) but it definitively addresses most of Finder shortcomings and adds a lot of nice things for the same price. \nIf you feel more adventurous, you can go ahead and see different alternatives and their prices right here.\nUpdate: Back in September 2010 TotalFinder didn't exist, but it's a very nice add-on that brings Tabs, Cut, Folder Reorder, etc. to the Finder. Not free, but way smaller than Path Finder if that's what you're looking for.\nLet\u2019s hope that 10.7 brings a new paradigm where questions like these are not relevant anymore :)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1470", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "20"}}

To do that add following line to ~/.yabairc:\nyabai -m config layout float\n\nskhd\nskhd is a simple hotkey daemon for macOS.\nskhd on github: https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd\nInstall skhd and add this line to ~/.skhdrc:\nctrl + cmd + alt - right : yabai -m window --space next\n\nThen you can move a window to another space with the shortcut ctrl + cmd + alt + right arrow\nYou can further extend that. Following you see how I configured it in ~/.skhdrc to move windows between spaces:\n# move window to next space and focus next space if next space is not last space of display\nctrl + shift + alt - right : [[ $(yabai -m query --spaces --space | jq '.index') != $(yabai -m query --displays --display | jq '.spaces | max') ]] \\\n                             && yabai -m window --space next \\\n                             && yabai -m window --space next\n\n\nA: BetterTouchTool: free and does the job plus a lot of extra ;) I use it in combination with ShiftIt for window resizing.\n\nA: While dragging a window, press key combo to move window to numbered space:\n\n\n*\n\n*Control + 1\n\n*Control + 2\n\n*Control + 3\n\n*etc ...\n\n\nEDIT: For Lion, I had to go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Mission Control and enable these hotkeys.\n\nA: SizeUp\nYou could have a look at SizeUp, which has been recommended on apple.se at least once before - it has some nice keyboard tools for throwing windows around multiple monitors (as I use it) and also for throwing them around multiple 'spaces'.\nIt's not free, but it's very useful and certainly worth the small registration fee.\n\nA: Amethyst\nWith Amethyst, you can send windows to specific spaces using configurable keyboard shortcuts.

If you do not want automatic tiling or the extra layout features that Amethyst provides, then add \"floating\" to Layouts under Preferences and remove all other layouts. Also, disable any keyboard shortcuts you do not need under the \"Shortcuts\" tab.\n\nA: There is one built in way to do this without using the mouse.

{"text": "Q: Alternative way to move windows around screen In X (Xfree86 on Linux or UNIX) I could move a window around the screen by holding down a modifier key (the CTRL key if memory serves me correctly) and move a window around the screen by dragging it from anywhere in the window (not limited to the title bar.) Is there a similar functionality available in OS X?\n\nA: MercuryMover\nAlthough it's a paid-for utility (which comes with it's own PrefPane etc), this is a great tool for chucking around your windows. You can also set it up to force windows to certain sizes on a shortcut, which is handy if you want to check out your web pages in a browser at 800x600, etc.\nBy default, you jut press CtrlCommandup-arrow and you get a little black pop-up window that helps you to move/resize the window that had focus when you pressed the shortcut. (the screen grab includes the PrefPane too).\n\n\nA: No, there isn't. The only thing that's possible is to drag a window that doesn't have focus using the Command key. In this way you can move windows in the background without changing focus.\n\nA: Have you looked at BetterTouchTool?\nIt boasts lots of other features, most notably complex trackpad gestures that can be used to call all sorts of built-in functionality, but does provide the ability to press and hold Ctrl to move a window with the mouse, without even holding left-click down.\nThe site says its only for Snow Leopard, but a Lion version is in the works (alpha is available, I think as of 0.73). Your particular feature, if that's all you enable, works fine in Lion.\n\nA: It's not exactly what you are looking for but in Lion you can now hold your mouse over the edge of a window and your cursor will turn into either a vertical or horizontal resize cursor (a new feature so you don't always have to use the bottom corner to resize).  However, if you click and drag your mouse in the opposite direction of the resize cursor, the entire window will move with no need to use the top title bar.\n\nA: Also Check these answers for other interesting OS X WM alternatives.\n\nA: I got annoyed that the only options for this aren't free and come bundled with a bunch of other features that are useless to me, so I wrote my own.\nmetamove\nA utility for emulating XFree86-style Meta+click and drag window movement.

{"text": "Q: Verify that entries in iTunes are actually on disk I have a ton and a half of songs in my iTunes (Windows 7). I recently consolidated my library from 3 different Hard Drives.\nI also deleted some of the unwanted music folders on my C Drive (but I forgot to make a list so I could delete from iTunes).\nI want to verify that all the songs in the library actually exist on disk.\nIt is physically impossible for me to just play each song one at a time to find out if it exists or not.\nI know that I have to disconnect my HDDs (just keep C drive) to do this.\nI know that I can export the library and purely check for the existence of file://D/ and file://E/, but that won't cover the music files blown away from the C drive.\nHow do I verify that all entries in iTunes have a physically valid file on my C drive?\n\nA: User \"sentinel\"'s approach is simple and elegant, but I cannot make it work. Steps 1 & 2 produce a playlist with ALL items, including those in the Library that do not have files on the disk.  The Select All in Step 1 selects all items, whether present on disk or not, and thus the playlist created from selection includes the bogus entries as well.  Therefore, Step 3 yields nothing. (Am I missing something?)\nMeanwhile I found a post elsewhere from someone calling him/herself dlegros in 2005, and though it is a workaround, it does work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Caveat: for this to work you need to use a field in the Get Info form that you do not use or do not care about, because you are going to ultimately erase any information that currently exists in that field for every song in the library. In this example we are going to use BPM (Beats Per Minute) as this seems rarely used and is not important to most people.  If BPM is important to you, don't do this, or find another field you don't care about.  You must use a field that is editable in the Get Info form.\n\n*Display your Music Library.\n\n*Add the BPM column to your view (in Windows right click the column headers and select Beats Per Minute).\n\n*Edit >> Select All\n\n*Open the Get Info form (File >> Get Info, OR Ctrl-I, OR right click one of the selected items and choose Get Info).  Make sure all of your songs are still selected and that the title on the top of the Get Info form says \"Mulitple Item Information\".\n\n*Change the BPM field to 999, make sure the check box next to that field is the only one checked in the form so that no other data will change, then click OK and wait for the library to process the change.  This will only change items when iTunes can find the file on disk.\n\n*Click the BPM column header to sort by BPM.  Everything that has blank BPM, or BPM not equal to 999 is a missing file.  Because you sorted, you see all the missing items together.  Select the block of missing items and delete them.\n\n*Though not completely necessary, Select All once again, Get Info, and change the BPM field to blank, select the checkbox next to BPM, and OK to reset them all to blank.\n\n*Select the column headers and remove Beats Per Minute from the view.\nIf there is a more straightforward approach, please let me know :)\n\nA: *\n\n*Choose Edit > Select all.\n\n*Now choose File > New playlist from selection. Call the playlist \"Exist\". Only the listings that exist on disk will be added to this playlist.\n\n*Now create a smart playlist called \"Do Not Exist\" with the conditions: Playlist is not \"Exist\", and Media Kind is Music.\nThe smart playlist called \"Do Not Exist\" now contains all the audio listings that do not exist on disk. To remove these listings, select all of them and hold down Shift as you press Delete.\n\nA: sentinel's answer is now 7 years old but still works... almost.  It won't work currently as stated.\nModifying it slightly, here's the new procedure as of 4/4/2017:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new playlist called \"Exists\".  Do not select any music first, just create it blank.  If you select all and \"New Playlist from Selection\", iTunes will NOT verify the songs, so don't do that.  Just create the blank playlist.\n\n*Select-All on your music and drag all the songs to that playlist.  This will take a couple minutes to process, as it's verifying that each song can be found.\n\n*Optional - Select All on your songs again and try to create a \"New Playlist from Selection\", to an \"Exists - Old Method\" playlist.  Then compare the song count of that playlist to the song count of the new method's \"Exists\" playlist.  The new method will have fewer songs if any weren't found.\n\n*Same as the old method, create a Smart Playlist named \"Not Exists\" or whatever, with rules \"Playlist is not 'Exists'\" and \"Media Kind is Music\".  Right click and update if it doesn't update on creation.\nThat playlist will contain all the songs that weren't found.  If you know they were just duplicates or whatever, you can simply select all, right click, and \"Delete From Library\" to clear them out and leave the non-duplicates.\nThat cleaned up my own library after I'd moved some directories around and re-added them.\nAnd until I did that, Sync'ing to my iPhone was erroring out on some of those duplicate songs and thus not syncing the songs at all, even the duplicates that DID exist.\nThanks for pointing the way, sentinel!\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1500", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "12"}}

{"text": "Q: Good way to keep iPad clean? I don't have a case or screen protector just yet for my iPad. What is a cost effective way to keep the screen clean and remove fingerprints?\n\nA: Use a micro fiber cloth, like the ones used for cleaning glasses. Works for my touch screen devices all the time and needs no extra liquids or any other fancy gear.\n\nA: I LOVE the iKlear products.  I spilled hot tea all over my MacBook Pro about 3 weeks after I bought it.  There were streaks of tea all over the screen and external case.  Luckily I was using a moshi keyboard cover which kept the liquid out of the keyboard area and probably saved my machine.  \nAfter I completely tore it down to make sure there was no internal damage, I tried cleaning the screen with a microfiber cloth and a small amount of water.  It worked alright but I could still see the streaks and even fingerprints and keyboard marks when I held the screen up to a light.  So I spent some time researching the best external cleaning solution and iKlear seemed to be held in high regard. \nI got this kit from Amazon and it's truly amazing how well the solution and cloths work to clean the glass screen.  The tea streaks and every other little smudge and bit of goo came off like magic.  Literally takes about 15 seconds to clean the screen to a mirror finish.  It works very well on the aluminum case and keyboard as well.\nI also use it on my iPod Touch and Motorola Droid.  Since the iPad is made out of the same stuff as the MBP and the iPod, I highly recommend this stuff.  You spent all that money on your iPad, i think it's worth an additional 20 bucks or so to get a good cleaning solution.\n\nA: Use the Fingerspoo iPad wallpaper and you won't notice fingerprints anymore.\n\n\nA: Options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Almost every Apple product except the iPad seems to come with a microfibre cloth, which I would recommend you use.\n\n*If you have a case for your iPad, I have seen some people buy a regular microfibre cloth and keep it in the case. Maybe even cut it to about 1/4 the size for portability.\n\n*The Apple store actually sells little microfibre cloths. They are pretty expensive though and are VERY small.\n\n*Use your shirt.\n\n\nA: I just use wet wipes. Gets chocolate off too\n\nA: I have quite a few microfiber cloths around the house that I use for detailing cars, and I usually keep one of those out (that hasn't been used on the car) to wipe my iPhone and iPad. \n\nA: Yesterday I was using mine in a meeting, and a guy next to me said, \"What do you use to wipe the screen down?\"\nI said, \"My shirt.\" And I demonstrated my super-fancy wipe-the-screen-on-my-shirt maneuver I've worked out.\nIt's cheap, and it works. It's not exactly high class, but whatever.\n\nA: In Belgium, we don\u2019t have \u201creal\u201d Apple Stores yet, but we do have Switch, which is the official Apple reseller in our country.\nAnyway, they sell this iClean product which can be used to clean your Mac. Guess what? It also works fine for iOS devices. It comes with a microfiber cloth included and it works really well for me.\n\nA: Wash your hands!\nOf course you would have to do it every 10 minutes or so...

Why is my MacBook Pro quitting and/or failing to start up?\nI need to replace one of my 2G DIMMs and in shopping around at Crucial and OWC I notice that they also carry matched sets. \nSo, is there any reason that I should spend the extra $ and replace both DIMMs as opposed to just the bad one?\n\nA: From my experience with PC's (not mac's), it's not absolutely necessary that you match your RAM.  However, it's also a bit of a crapshoot because different RAM modules have different timings and voltage requirements, so:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you use modules with different timings, you'll have to run both modules at the lowest speed or risk instability in the module with the lower speed timings.\n\n*if the modules have different power requirements, you run into the same issue as above.  If you run at the lower of the voltages, the higher voltage module may be unstable.  If you run at the higher voltage, the lower voltage module may be unstable or even fail.\nHopefully someone else can comment on how this applies in an Apple computer since there is no way that I know of to modify voltage and RAM timings.  Note however, that even in a PC, two completely different RAM modules usually work without incident if you match voltages and use the lower of the two modules timings.  Even different voltages will usually work.\nI would look for a module that carries the same specifications as your original RAM, at least as far as timing (latency) and voltage are concerned.  If you can find one then I wouldn't be very concerned about using it with your existing RAM stick.  The chances of it being incompatible or causing instability would be very low in my opinion.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1512", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

Jitouch allows me to make gestures correspond to actions in different applications, but it doesn't allow me to select Unix programs (like the Synergy server) as a target.\n\nA: The reason for this is that the Synergy server doesn't have an OS X frontend. I have the same issue with my Logitech mouse configuration -- I want to have a different scroll speed for Synergy because when I have acceleration enabled, the remote computer doesn't scroll properly. So I'd like to disable acceleration only when using synergy.\nThe solution would be to package synergys as an OS X app which, when you move your mouse to the remote computer, brings itself to the front (so that the menu bar contains only the Apple menu and a \"Synergy\" menu). I have planned for a long time to create such a wrapper which would accomplish this but just haven't had the time. \nI didn't realize others would be interested in the same idea...

I then have to know which was the last downloaded iPhone photo and download only the newer ones.\nPicasa Import also loads/displays ALL photos on the iPhone (which is very cumbersome with so many images to load off the device...)\nI guess I'd like to know if anyone has a similar workflow/requirements and how they do it.\nMy current plan is to set up a workflow that removes photos from the Camera Roll as I download them, but then have iTunes sync them back on as albums based on folders - I may even automatically resize them so I have smaller versions on the iPhone and the original full size versions on my Mac (so conserve previous iPhone storage space) [UPDATE: iTunes automatically does this, which is too bad because it means I no longer have FULL SIZE backups on my phone, only on my computer...]\n\nA: What you\u2019re asking is a hell of automation and it can\u2019t be done \u201cjust\u201d like that. \nI suggest you try to make a combination of Automator and Smart Albums on iPhoto. Things you want to know about iTunes: EXIF is not preserved when Synced to iPhone through iTunes which is part of your requirements. \nYou could use a Smart Album in iPhoto and Flag the pictures you want to transfer then create another Smart Album with those flagged pictures and only transfer those (or vice versa). Use Keywords to your advantage. Consider a nice app like Keyword Manager for iPhoto to help you with that. \nI have no idea why iPhoto makes you nervous, but you should be pointing at iTunes for that\u2026 \niPhoto is perfectly suitable for picture maintenance and sorting. You can later use automator to resize them and do fancy things (even tagging!). The same can be said about Aperture. \nYour workflow should be, download to iPhoto automatically. Classify, Tag, Delete Bad ones, Adjust, Edit, and transfer to your devices for later viewing (and backup). If you just want to have a backup up of what you do, let Time Machine do it\u2019s work with your iPhoto Library or add another step, use Image Import (or Cameras) to organize, then add to iPhoto for treatment and later transfer to your device(s). The original imported folder will be untouched and, eventually backed up by Time Machine too. \n\nA: why don't you use Automator to do the workflow you pretend?\nAutomator is very powerfull and you can find much more Actions on Apple website that you can complete your workflow.\nThe Automator Comunnity is also amazing and posting your questions there you will get an answer quickly!\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1537", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: Is anyone else having signal strength problems on an iPhone 3GS since the iOS 4.1 upgrade? Since upgrading my iPhone 3GS to iOS 4.1, I've periodically seen 1 bar or \"Searching...\" at home and work where I used to have 4 or 5 bars.  And I've sent text messages with 4 bars, only to have it immediately drop to 1 and the text message error out.\nI'm trying to learn if I'm alone with this issue (and should therefore bring my phone to my local Apple Store\u2014after trying a restore just so I can say I did when they inevitably suggest that), or if this is a common problem (and we should then file bugs at bugreport.apple.com).\nUpdate (to answer Louis Gerbarg's question): I've installed every new update, so I believe I upgraded from 4.0.2 to 4.1.  I think I noticed Apple's bar display calibration changes after the 4.0.1 upgrade, though the difference was subtle.  I did not have dropped call problems and errors sending text messages until the 4.1 upgrade.\nUpdate #2: I restored my iPhone to factory defaults (but still with 4.1 installed), and still had the problems.  So I took it to my local Apple Genius Bar and explained this, and they exchanged the phone for a new one.  The new iPhone 3GS had 4.0.2.  But I still don't have the problems after installing 4.1.  This must have been a hardware issue.\n\nA: Did you move from 4.0 to 4.1, or from 4.0.1/2 to 4.1? Between 4.0 and 4.0.1 Apple changed the calibration of the bar display, such that at a given signal strength it shows a fewer bars. They did that in response to the iPhone 4 antenna publicity, but the changes were done for all devices that support 4.x.\nSo, if you went straight from 4.0 to 4.1 getting fewer bars is expected, though if you are dropping calls where you previously didn't that is a real issue, or if you updated from 4.0.2.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1547", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

I don't have Quicktime Pro, but I'll get it if that's the best way to do this.\nEdit: Just to clariify this is Mac OSX 10.6 I'm on.\n\nA: Virtual concatenation script demuxer\nYou only need ffmpeg\n\n*\n\n*At the end, write the video files that you want to combine into a text file. Here is an example, it is best to drag the video files into the text file. The name of the text file is in my example files.txt\nfile 'Video 1.mp4'\nfile 'Video 2.mp4'\nfile 'Video 3.mp4'\nfile 'Video 4.mp4'\n\nNow open the terminal and enter. Finish.\nffmpeg -safe 0 -f concat -i files.txt -c copy output.mp4\n\n\nA: You don\u2019t specify your OS but if you have OS/X, then you probably have iLife, then you have iMovie. Merging all that with iMovie is extremely trivial. Just import the videos to iMovie and compose the final movie using all the parts you want to use. \nEffects, Transitions and Captions are a bonus ;)\n\nA: Quicktime Pro is a must-have in such situation. iMovie is great if you need a simple tool, but you may loose quality in the process.\n\nA: Yes, Quicktime can connect 2 Mpeg4s but if you want to upload to a video platform like Youtube or Vimeo they will still appear as 2 videos and will not upload properly. They must be \"stitched\" together by a program designed to do this. There are 3 ways to do this that I know of.\n\n*\n\n*Importing each MP4 into an editing program, editing them together and exporting the sequence to Mpeg4 (if your Editor has this capability. If not you must export at whatever formats your editor allows and then encode the sequence in another program). This is time-consuming and there will be a small loss in quality depending on your Editor as you have encoded them twice (on Import and then again on export).\n\n*There are apps designed to stitch multiple Mp4s together like the free \"MP4 Joiner\". They will do it quickly and work well if each Mp4 compression parameters match. For example if one has a resolution of 1920 X 1080 and the other is 1280 X 720 or if one was compressed at 4000 Kbps (Kilobytes per second) and the other at 5000 Kbps or if different codecs were used the app cannot connect them.\n\n*You could use a professional compression/encoder program like Sorenson Squeeze, Telestream Episode, Apple Compressor, or Adobe Media Encoder and re-encode your Mp4s to Mp4 using the same settings. These are expensive programs but will do the job without quality loss.  There are others programs that can do the job for far less money or even free like Handbrake, just Google Mp4 Encoders. If you use a decent program there will be little or no loss in quality.\n\n\nA: Well, I'm late to the game but the best way IMHO would be to just use mp4joiner and be done with it.\nIt just does one thing, merging mp4 files, and does it really well and simple.

It's hard to read all that tiny text from 7 feet away from my TV set, so I'm always zooming in.\nSo: is there some extension or hidden hack way to force Safari to zoom in automatically?\n\nA: There is a wonderful safari extension, SafariMagnifier, which can set default zoom-in scale for every page. \nhttp://www.wannseii.com/safarimagnifier/\n\nA: As Am1rr3zA mentioned, you can select a custom style sheet from the preferences:\n\nI have added these rules to my safari.css file:\nhtml {\n    zoom: 125%;\n}\nimg {\n    zoom: 75%;\n}\n@media print {\n    html {\n        zoom: 100%;\n    }\n}\n\nIt has a lot of annoying side-effects though. But ZoomBySite and AllPagesZoom have the same side-effects, and there is also a noticeable delay before AllPagesZoom changes the zoom level.\n\nA: If you go to \"preferences\" in the Safari tab and then to \"advanced\" you can click the \"Never use font sizes smaller than\" button and then pick the font size you want.

It can now memorize the zoom level per site. Also, we can custom this by the menu item \"Safari\" --> \"Settings for This Website...\", and the exact option \"Page Zoom\" can be found there. More detailed information can be found here and here.\n\nA: According to this post from Apple's Safari Support discussion forum:\n\n1) Create a file named defaultzoom.css (or any name you like, just make sure it has a css extension.)\n2) Copy and paste in the following:  \n    body {  \n      zoom: 130%;  \n    }\n\nchange 130 to whatever number suits you. >100 means zoom in, <100 means zoom out.

{"text": "Q: iTunes Store: \"Your payment method was declined.\" Last night I attempted to purchase an app from the App Store on my iPhone 4. The previous day I had purchased an app with no issues, and this time was told that my payment method was invalid. When I clicked 'Continue' to fix my information, everything was correct so I re-inputted my credit card security code and tapped done. No, fail, declined.\nI called my bank as I am currently vacationing in Ireland, and if my debit card (the card my iTunes account uses) starts getting declined I will have issues. No, no problems, they had a note in my account that I was traveling, and there are no holds or flags on my spending. She also noted that the iTunes store had requested a verification of $0.99 but had not charged the card for the amount.\nI returned to the iTunes store on my iPhone and attempted again to input my credit card information. Still declined. I entered a second credit card. Declined. I opened up iTunes on my laptop (OS X 10.6, iTunes 10) and checked my account information there. No prompt about it being incorrect when I log in, unlike on the iPhone which tells me \u2013 even for free apps \u2013 that my payment method was declined as soon as I input my password.\nI attempted to purchase the app from the store on my computer and sync it to the iPhone. As soon as I click on purchase, I am asked to authenticate. As soon as I authenticate, I am asked to fix my credit card information. As soon as I fix my credit card information, I am returned to the screen I was at previously where I elected to purchase this app (in this case, that screen is the home page of the App Store).\nTwo different cards, no issues with the bank, no way to get it working in iTunes proper on the desktop or through various attempts in the App Store in the iPhone. Any ideas? Any suggestions?\n\nA: I actually had this issue before too. I am not sure what caused it, but after waiting a couple of days, it worked again. Here are people discussing it on the Apple Support Forums, but there doesn't appear to be a resolution. I think mine may have been a transient service issue or something. It never happened again after this. \n\nA: The \"official\" way to fix, per Apple, it is to email Apple's iTunes support (iTunesStoreSupport@apple.com), inform them of the problem, and then wait for them to fix it for you on their end. The good news about this solution is that my email was answered very quickly, the support person knew what the issue was and how to fix it, and within a couple days of telling them about the problem they had fixed it and I am up and working again.\nAfter they told me it was fixed, it did take almost exactly 24 hours to take effect, and in the email they told me \"wait about 24 hours and try purchasing an app again.\"\nAt the time I was having this problem (while traveling abroad) I was in no mood to \"wait it out\" as other answers have suggested, but since it was handled so capably and promptly by iTunes Support, I wouldn't suggest that as a course of action. It is a known issue for them.\n\nA: THIS WORKED FOR ME\nI spoke with my credit card company, they mentioned the name had to match EXACTLY as on your card, INCLUDING BEING IN CAPS.  Because there is no place for middle name, add it after first name in the app store credit card info, for example First Name: JOHN C Last Name: SMITH.  Once I did this, it worked.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: I keep getting this problem with Itunes and this is the way I solved it without contacting Apple. \n1. Make sure you have funds on your dedicated card\n2. Check details with the bank and inform them of any details that cannot be entered correctly into itunes ie Title Itunes lists Ms, Mrs and Mr but not Miss. \n3. Take off all payment information on Itunes sign out of your account and close Itunes and leave it for about an hour and then re-enter the details.\nThis works for me but I cannot guarnetee if it will work for anyone else.\n\nA: i solved it by logging out of Store in my iPad. Then re-login. At that point, it prompted me to check the payment details. I did the necessary and its gone.\nFire up iTunes in your computer logout, then login again. It should be resolved.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1623", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}
{"text": "Q: OS X Terminal equivalent of Ctrl+Left / Ctrl+Right In Windows and Linux I could always hit ctrl+\u2190 or ctrl+\u2192 to skip a word to the left or right in the terminal.  In text editors it seems that \u2325+\u2190/\u2192 works, but no dice in the terminal.  I've searched Google and found nothing except a Wikipedia page that claims \u2325+B/F does the job, but all it does is print \u222b and \u0192 characters to my terminal (or \u0131 and \u00cf if I hold \u21e7). Any ideas? \n\nA: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal maps \u2325-\u2190/\u2192 to esc+B/F by default, so this is now built-in for bash and other programs that use these emacs-compatible keybindings.\n\nA: if you know how to use vi you can also turn on vi line editing mode using set -o vi in your .bash_profile or at any time on the command line.  Then you can switch between vi command and insert modes.  So you could hit escape, then use the vi commands for navigating the line:\n0 = move to beginning of line\n$ = move to end of line\nw = move forward one word\nb = move backward one word\n\nOnce you get to the correct position, you can use the other vi commands to enter insert or append modes, or remove characters one by one, etc.\n\nA: Open terminal, go to preferences, keyboard. On the list you'll find \u201cctrl cursor right\u201d and \u201cctrl cursor left\u201d.\nChange their assigned actions to \u201c\\033f\u201d and \u201c\\033b\u201d respectively, and you'll be able to use ctrl+\u2192 and ctrl+\u2190 to move, without losing your alt key.\n\nA: This was driving me crazy too, however I didn't want a Terminal-specific fix as I don't use Terminal, and being able to SSH into my OSX box had to use the correct keybindings too.\nAlso, personally, I didn't care about the \u2325 key as discussed earlier; I wanted to maintain the ctrl+&leftarrow;/&rightarrow; combination that I'm used to on Linux.\nTo solve this problem, I added the following to my ~/.profile:\nbind '\"\\e[5C\": forward-word'\nbind '\"\\e[5D\": backward-word'\nbind '\"\\e[1;5C\": forward-word'\nbind '\"\\e[1;5D\": backward-word'\n\nNote the first two apply to bash in Terminal; the last two apply to bash in iTerm2 and incoming ssh connections. Don't ask me why the keyboard emulation is different ;)\nFor the record, I was able to find what the keycodes actually were thanks to a hint from this stackoverflow answer: You can run cat > /dev/null to monitor the exact keycodes sent during a key combination.\n(Note that for me, when I run cat > /dev/null and press ctrl+&leftarrow; it produces ^[[1;5D. Your exact keycode may differ, but the first ^[ is represented as \\e, as shown in my example code.)\nBTW, if you want to see all active bash keybindings, run bind -p.\n\nA: It seems that esc+B and esc+F are mapped by default to go to the beginning and end of words. Although, for my system you can't hold down esc but have to re-press it for each word.\n\nA: You can use the \u2325 key, but you have to select the option to use it as the \"meta\" key:\n\nOnce you do that, \u2325+F and \u2325+B will work as you expect.\n\nA: Latest version of OS maps this to Spaces.

{"text": "Q: Do location-aware apps work on the iPod touch? A lot of iPhone apps use GPS positioning to provide services. However, the iPod touch does not have GPS capabilities, although it does have WiFi-based location services, if I'm not mistaken. Do location-aware apps work on the iPod touch? If so, how well? I'm not interested in the iPhone right now, but since I live in a city, it would be cool to have a device that would allow me to call up maps and such when I'm walking around.\n\nA: Yes. The \"location services\" work the same way on all iOS devices, while the specifics of how that data is obtained are hidden from the application.\nThis Apple support article might be helpful to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone and iPod touch: Understanding Location Services\n\nA: Yes, most definitely.  I was actually quite astonished by the accuracy too.  I have a fourth generation iPod Touch (and this story was back with the iOS 4 operating system).  It actually made me sort of paranoid at first, until I looked into the technology behind it.\nI was walking through a parking lot and staring at the Maps app on my iPod when I realized that every couple of seconds the pointer would move.  The device was literally tracking my position as I walked through the parking lot, literally with the precision of a parking space. WOW.\nHere is the real kicker, though.  The device does not have GPS nor was there an internet WiFi connection!  How does that work, right?!?!  My WiFi was turned on, but it was not connected to anything. I had heard of GPS and I had heard of looking up the IP-address (that the Internet Service Providers assign), but I had not heard of anything that would explain this.\nApparently, the device actually triangulates (like cell tower triangulation on cell phones), but with WiFi hotspots.  You dont have to be connected to the internet nor to the networks in question to use WiFi triangulation.  Your device has a database of local WiFi hotspots that it looked up the last time it connected to the internet.\nNow, I dont know where this database comes from. If it looked up ALL local WiFi spots based on your location. Or if it looked up only WiFi connections that it has detected in the past (but didnt know locations for at the time). Or what. But somehow the device builds a database of WiFi connections that it recognizes later and recalls location information for. The device is capable of detecting and recognizing many, many more WiFi signals than it displays in your WiFi connections window, the latter being only the ones that are strong and coherent enough to make useable connections to.\nLater, your device can use the signal strength, direction, distance, so forth, relative to one or more WiFi hotspots, to compute your location.  And guess what? It even works with password protected WiFi that you cant access.\nIf you connect to the internet via a public WiFi, it will update the database tables with more, newer information based on your new location and other networks it has detected on your way there.  Each WiFi connection has a special numeric code associated with it (Im not sure if this is the IP address, or MAC address, or what) that the device looks up online and pulls geographic coordinates for.\nI can walk through neighborhoods in my area that I have never been to before, and without connecting to any internet there, the device will still pinpoint my location. But only if both WiFi is turned on and Location Services is turned on. I would only turn the former off to preserve battery life and the latter to protect anonymity.\nThis method of triangulation is more accurate than, and your device prefers it over, the more commonly recognized IP-address lookup.  Once you establish an internet connection, your device can use your IP address to determine your location within a certain radius.  The precision is no better than the radius of the WiFi signal, coupled with the precision of determining the location of the hardwired network hardware.\nThe only location service your device prefers over WiFi triangulation is the GPS chip, which is only available on certain models of certain devices.\nWhat your device prefers less than IP-address lookup is cell tower based location services: Cell Tower Triangulation, which the device doesnt have to have a cellular connection to. In fact, you dont even necessarily have to have a subscription to cellular service. The device uses the distance, direction, signal strength, etc, to one or more cell towers that it detects, to determine your location relative to them. Again, this method only works with models and devices that have cellular capabilities.\nThe more technologies at play, and if you have a direct internet connection with which to look up data, the more accurate your location can become.  Nothing is more accurate than GPS, but there is still something called Assisted GPS (A-GPS) which uses the internet to help determine time (and location) to help get better fixes on GPS satellites. This not only improves accuracy, but it makes the whole process faster.\nUnfortunately, there doesnt seem to be a way to prevent websites and apps on the iOS from collecting your location information without forfeiting the usefulness of location services. I would prefer passive location services which determine my location without sending it over the internet when it can.  Apple promises anonymity, but also warns you that they have no liability for third-party apps violating your privacy.\nIf you live in a city, I highly recommend getting a smart touch device like the iPod or iPad. Ive heard that the new iPad 5 will have GPS.  I have had an iPod Touch for a couple of years now and its wonderful. Its a small computer/calculator in my pocket that provides me with maps, bus schedules, and internet.  In the city, there are WiFi signals open to the public EVERYWHERE.  I would rather spend $400 on a Touch (and $90/year on Skype's internet-based telephone service [useable on the iPod with a free Skype app]) than get a free iPhone with a two-year $100/month contract. Ridiculous. The only difference is the GPS, and you can get a separate GPS device at amazon.com for $40 if you really need two-inch precision that badly.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1628", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

I still use my original 3G cable (the one where you had to press buttons on the side to release it) to plug my iPhone 4 into my iMac, and nothing has gone wrong so far :)\n\nA: I'm using the same cables across all my Apple devices (I have so many around, and can't really tell them apart any more).  One bit of caution regarding the wall plug, though: there was one model that shipped with either the original iPhone or the 3G which was recalled because it was prone to overheating.\nIf you haven't run into a problem with yours by now, it's probably not an issue.  Just wanted to offer the heads-up.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1629", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: What do I need to do to sell my iPhone 3GS? I've upgraded my iPhone 3GS to iPhone 4 (and my wife's as well). The new phones came with their own US/AT&T microSIM cards and have been activated. So we still have our old phones with the old SIM cards in them. I've deleted the data off of the old phones, and I would like to sell them.\nWhat do I need to do to sell the old phones? Do I remove the SIM from the phone and expect the buyer to put their own SIM in there? How do they go about getting a legit SIM from AT&T to put in the phone? Or do they use the SIM that is in there? How can I be assured the old phones cannot be linked to my current account in any way?\n\nA: One easy option, if you can use the store credit, is to sell them to Radio Shack for $200 [1].\nIf you prefer cold hard cash, or think you can do better than $200, there's a market for them on eBay, and it's easy to search for the going rate.  The phones will be easier to sell for more if you can jailbreak and/or unlock them in advance.  (How to do that is best left for another question.)\nAs for how a conscientious buyer activates your old phone through the proper channels, it's my understanding that once you've upgraded your line, your old phone can simply be brought into any AT&T store and associated with a new account.  I.e., you can & should sell the phone without a SIM.\nOnce it's been wiped and no longer has your SIM, the phone is no longer linked to you.\n[1] http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-20008186-233.html\n\nA: Gazelle.com specializes in buying and reselling or recycling old gadgets. They pledge to completely remove any user data.\n\nA: Technically, once you get a new SIM, the old one is deactivated and no longer associated with your account, so you don't have to bother taking it out. I still would, just to be safe though.\nI'm actually looking to buy a 3GS for development. I have a 3G and a 4, but would like that as well.

{"text": "Q: How can I disable multitasking in iOS4? I upgraded my iPhone 3GS to iOS4 and although I love most of the new feaures, multitasking keeps me checking for open apps.\nIs there a way to disable multitasking support in iOS4 or a \"kill all apps\" app/switch?\n\nA: One way to control multitasking on iOS4 is to jailbreak your device, install Backgrounder, and install Remove Recents.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Backgrounder you can prevent apps from multitasking until you allow them.\n\n*Using Remove Recents will clear out all the \"recently used\" apps so that only the apps that are actually multitasking are shown.\n\n\nCompletely disabling multitasking is also possible. Here's how to disable Multitasking, Homescreen Wallpaper, or both on a 3GS. A jailbroken device is required.\nEdit the file N88AP.plist in the directory /System/Library/CoreServices/SpringBoard.app on your iPhone. Look for the following key-value pairs and set them to false as shown. Reboot when complete.\n<key>homescreen-wallpaper</key>\n<false/>\n\n<key>multitasking</key>\n<false/>\n\nI figured this out by reading this article about enabling Homescreen Wallpaper on a 3G, although I did the opposite.\nhttp://pixelatedgeek.com/2010/06/ios4-jailbreak-and-multitasking-now-available-for-iphone-3g/\nNote:\nYou will need a way to edit plist files. Either use a special plist editor, or use a tool to convert to XML. To do the conversion on your phone, install Ericia Utilities (from Cydia) and issue the following commands to convert the file to XML and back.\nplutil -convert xml1 N88AP.plist\nplutil -convert binary1 N88AP.plist\n\n\nA: I believe it's an option when you jailbreak using redsn0w. It's an option. Here's a tutorial. \n\nA: You may be worrying more than you need to be.  Apps can only use multitasking for certain functions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Playing audio\n\n*Tracking your location\n\n*VOIP\n\n*Local notifications and alerts\n\n*Complete a lengthy operation\n\n\nIn all cases, rather than the app remaining running, the system keeps it suspended and awakens it at appropriate times, such as when it needs to fetch more audio.  If the app uses too much CPU while it's in the background, it gets terminated.  If the foreground app needs more memory, then the background apps will get terminated as necessary.\nThe apps in the multitasking menu aren't necessarily consuming any resources or battery life, it's more like a \"most recently used\" list.  Apps will still be listed there whether or not they are actually running.  You can help prove this to yourself by turning the phone off and on; the recent list will still be populated even though obviously all the apps are terminated.\n\nA: There is no close all option as far as I'm aware, but you can close them one by one:\n\"Double-tap the home button to bring up the multitasking bar, which pops up from the bottom of the home screen. Then, you simply scroll through the icons, find the one you wish to close, press and hold the icon, and then click the red circle with a dash--Apple's visual representation of a delete symbol.\" - Via PCWorld.com\n\nA: There is a close all button if you install sbsettings, it's called  Remove Background.

{"text": "Q: Can iPhone battery apps actually prolong battery life? I've seen a few apps that claim they do some kind of conditioning/deep charge/other jargon to extend the life of an iPhone battery. Is this just hokum or do I really need one of these apps to maximize the life of my battery?\n\nA: Of course a jail free app could prolong battery life, by tweaking into the system, just like Apple could (and like some android apps already do, since android has almost no management restrictions for developers). Couple things that could be done, for instance: killing apps that are known to consume batter life, or maybe turning off the screen when needed in an intelligent way.\nBut, as you may picture now, it's so much work that I doubt any good app will come along and I don't really know of any that do. Also, from a developer point of view, it'd be way too much time spent researching, testing and doing this for too little result, because this is already one of Apple's primary worries.\nHere are few better things to do for prolonging battery life, from Apple's own list:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off push notifications / Fetch new data less frequently / Turn off push mail \n\n*Turn off Wi-Fi / Turn off Bluetooth\n\n*Use Airplane Mode in low- or no-coverage areas\n\n*Adjust brightness\n\n*Turn off EQ\n\n*Use iPhone Regularly (go through at least one charge cycle per month)\n\n\nAs for Apple Store apps, no way in hell. The app itself won't improve battery at all. At least not \"automagically\". It could work only as an insturctive reminder, at most.\n\nA: Yes - if it's the thing that gets you to change your behavior. Whether you call it snake oil, a placebo or social engineering, changing your perception or spurring you to action is powerful and can shape your world.\nNo - without you doing something different, using more energy to \"monitor\" the battery obviously leaves less energy for the rest of the things you normally have running.\n\nA: From what I understand, iPhone apps don't have the power to regulate the power consumption of other apps and iOS system processes. These apps sound like snake oil to me.\n\nA: Apple themselves recommend a deep cycle every month:\n\nBe sure to go through at least one\n  charge cycle per month (charging the\n  battery to 100% and then completely\n  running it down).\n\nIf the app reminds you to do this every 30 days, then yes, it will improve your battery life. Unfortunately, I've seen some apps that tell you to go down to 20% and then open the app while it is charging. That isn't letting it \"completely run down\", and so, it would do nothing for your phone.\nBesides reminding you of doing a deep cycle every 30 days, I don't see how any app could improve your battery life. If anything, it would ruin your battery life by staying running in the background.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1685", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "17"}}

That is useful for saving power and for security.\nTurning the phone off can be accomplished by holding down the Lock button until the red arrow button displays saying \"slide to power off\". Turning off the phone in this manner will allow any running processes / services to shut down gracefully. This is akin to shutting down your Mac. Shutting down your iOS device every few days will free up leaked memory and may help it to work better or faster. I shut my phone off nearly every night, then plug it into the wall charger which turns it back on automatically.\nHolding down the power and home buttons until the device restarts itself is called a \"hard reset\" and is akin to pressing and holding the power button on a Mac. Restarting in this manner does not give running processes a chance to shut down gracefully and may in fact result in lost data. This technique should be a last resort, not a daily practice because of its potential ill effects.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1703", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}
{"text": "Q: Is it worth upgrading my jailbroken 3G to iOS4? I have a jailbroken (not unlocked) iPhone 3G running the 3.1.2 firmware. What are the pros and cons of upgrading this to iOS4?\nBeing jailbroken, I already have multitasking and home-screen wallpapers. What does the new iOS give me that I don't already have access to?\n\nA: I've done it and it's not worth the trouble.  I'm considering rolling back to 3.1.2.\nThe beneficial changes are minimal (and most can be provided by a jailbreak app), and the performance decrease is very noticeable.  I've found that crashes are much more frequent as well.\nMy advice: Don't do it.\n\nA: In my personal experience, iOS 4 was only marginally slower than iPhone OS 3, so it really comes down to features.\nFirst, iOS 4 does not allow you to put home screen wallpapers on an iPhone 3G. I don't have experience with multitasking on a jailbroken device, but again iOS does not provide this functionality on the iPhone 3G. However, given the memory and processor of the iPhone 3G, you really wouldn't want to multitask on the device.\nIn terms of features that iOS 4 does offer the iPhone 3G, here are some top ones:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail - unified inbox, multiple Exchange accounts, message threading\n\n*Folders - a very useful way to store similar apps to save space\n\n*iBooks - eBook and PDF reader (useful, though this app was somewhat slow on my 3G)\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that there are already apps that require iOS 4 and the number's only going to grow. Not having iOS 4 will reduce the number of apps that will run on your device.\nSince I never really got a lot of utility from jailbreaking, it made the decision to upgrade pretty easy for me. However, if having a wallpaper or running apps from Cydia is important to you, you're not really missing out on a whole lot, at least for now.\n\nA: Most of what I've heard is that it's not worth running on the 3G as it's very sluggish.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1706", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

What's the recommended way to sell it in the UK? It has one small crack on the back near the vibration switch so it probably doesn't count as near new (depending on your definition of near).\n\nA: The lowest hassle way is probably via one of these \"phone recycling\" sites.  eg:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mazuma Mobile (offering \u00a3172 or \u00a3189.20 in Argos\nvouchers currently)\n\n*Envirophone (offering \u00a3160 currently)\n\n*FoneBank (offering \u00a3161 currently)\n\n\nIt might not be the best deal on offer, but it's easy.  I sold an old (though much cheaper) handset via Mazuma recently with no problems.\n\nA: I sold mine on eBay and it was quite a hassle. Before I managed the final sale the iPhone was won twice by bogus bidders. \nAnd not only do you have to pay eBay fees (listing + 10% of final sale price)  but you'll probably have to pay paypal fees as well. After these fees I made about \u00a3190. Caveat venditor.\nIf you can get similar from one of the recyclers then I'd recommend. I've used both Mazuma and Envirofone before with no issues. \n\nA: AV Forums has a well established buying and selling forum. You'll get a far better price than a recycling site would offer.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1712", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: Any way to recover data from a semi-bricked iPhone? My iPhone turns on, shows the white apple logo, and then after a few minutes shuts off. It is not a battery issue, it happens even when it's plugged in.\nIs there any way I can get the data off the phone without resorting to a hard-drive recovery company?\nMaybe some kind of program that can access the hard drive through the USB port? Or maybe I can open up the phone and somehow get the data off the hard drive?\nI know that I can restore the phone through iTunes and have it working again. The problem is that I didn't back up the data so I have 400 or so notes saved only on the phone. If I restore it, they will be gone forever.\nJust in case you are wondering, I haven't jailbroken or even attempted to jailbreak the phone. This problem just happened randomly while I was using the phone. It was frozen one day, I tried a hard reset, and ever since then I can never get it to work. I read that some people got the same issue via a remote wipe, however, I'm not subscribed to mobile me, so there is no way that could have happened.\n\nA: If there is an Apple store in proximity, book an appointment with their tech.

{"text": "Q: Will initiating recovery mode on an iPhone permanently disable it until it is recovered? I'm trying to solve an issue I'm having, and I thought that placing the phone in recovery mode temporarily might resolve the problem. I'm afraid to try this though, since the phone contains valuable information, it would be dangerous for me to complete the process and actually recover the phone.\nSo I want to put it in recovery mode, but not go through with it all the way.\nWould a phone normally still be usable after initiating but not going through recovery mode? Or must you complete the recovery process in order to use the phone again?\n\nA: I had an extra iPhone (that didn't have important information) which I just tried it on. Simply initiating the recovery process (by pressing and hold home button while plugging it into the computer) will not cause anything irreversible to happen on the phone. You still have to click a few buttons on iTunes to start the process.\nTo go out of recovery mode, simply eject the iPhone through iTunes, disconnect the cable, and restart the phone.

I want to export these to a different program that can import text files.

If there's any way to preserve the creation date (if it's even stored), that's desired too.\nIs there any way to do this? I have both a Mac and PC.\n\nA: In OS X, they're automatically synced to Mail.app. There is a section on the left side of the screen that says \"Notes.\" If you like, I can post screenshots later (not at my MacBook right now).\nHere's a way to sync them with a Google account. This is pretty cool, and probably the best way to sync between multiple computers/ devices. Check it out. If you don't have a Google account, might be worth it now lol.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: iTunes can setup notes sync with MS Outlook or OS X Mail(OS X >10.5.8). This can be setup under the info tab for your device in iTunes, and sync will take place when the device is plugged into the computer by the USB cable.\nOnce in Outlook, you can save notes as text files. The notes have creation and modifcation date attached. Saving as text will strip some of that information.\n\nA: These days in macOS Catalina, you can use this AppleScript that I cobbled together from a couple of sources as a reliable way to save both a pretty good rich text export of the notes along with hard-coded timestamps of both the original note creation and the last time it was edited.\nThis will produce an RTF for each note in your home folder, as long as it's contained in a Notes folder called \"Batchgroup\".

Does anyone know of TRULY free (preferably open-source) WMA conversion software? Is that even legal? If it exists, someone please let me know where to find it. I've been searching, and only came up with AVS Audio Converter...which is \"free...\" They give you a free trial, but each encode has a voice logo over your file. I could just use Audacity to edit that out, but who wants to go through that?\nAnyway, please let me know if free WMA conversion software exists anywhere on this world wide internetz.\n\nA: If these are unprotected files (non-DRM), you should be able to drop them directly into iTunes on a Mac and convert them to MP3 or AAC. I've never owned or used a Windows PC so I don't know if the same thing will work on Windows iTunes, but you could give it a try.\nOn a Mac, you can also install Flip4Mac, which enables you to load WMA files in QuickTime and convert them to MP3 or AAC. If you have a bunch of files, you could set up an Autmomator action to automatically do this on a folder full of files.\n\nA: If you are running Windows the free version of Media Monkey will do this:\n\nRecord CDs and convert MP3s, M4A, OGG, FLAC and WMA files etc. into other formats.\n\nIt comes with a time limited mp3 encoder, but you can replace that yourself. However, this probably isn't an issue if you're converting for the iPhone.\n\nA: ffmpeg can do all that. As far as I can tell, it's a commandline-only program, but that has the plus side that you can run it in batch mode easily.\n\nA: If you are using iTunes for Windows, it is easy.\nLaunch iTunes, and then click File > Add File to Library to open WMA files that you want to import. Then a window will pop up as clearly shown in the picture below. Just click Convert to convert WMA to iTunes M4A format. Once the conversion is done, you can play WMA files in iTunes or import WMA to iPhone, iPad and iPod.\n\nBut if you are using iTunes for Mac, it is a little complicate. You'd better to convert WMA to iPhone supported formats. Maybe this step by step guide will help you.\nIf your WMA files are DRM-protected, you have to remove the DRM first.\n\nA: The Windows version of iTunes already does conversion of non-protected wma files, so you could just use iTunes to re-encode your eligible files.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1778", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}

On my care (Acura TL), the bluetooth profile lets me play iPod music through the stereo when the phone is paired. As a result of that, ALL of the phone's audio plays back through the stereo... including text alerts and any apps that play back voice sounds (navigation, etc).\nIt's probably too simple an answer, but it's worth checking to see if you can pair up using the audio profile for music -- in which case you'd get the phone's other audio as well.\n\nA: I think Navigon works over A2DP with music; its on sale at the moment too.

The app evens works via email\nand FTP. The only caveat is that the\nvideos cannot be over 200 MB in size.\n\nRegarding with how to use it, check out this post:\nhttp://islandinthenet.com/2010/07/06/pixelpipe-upload-720p-hd-video-from-iphone-4-to-youtube/\nI recommend that post, it gives some great information on the app and how it is used.\nFor example:\n\nA \u201cpipe\u201d is the\nconnector between the PixelPipe app\nand one or more destination sites\nwhere you want your content to be\nuploaded. For example, I set up pipes\nfor flickr, picasa, and Dropbox and\nmany others.\nI setup some of my pipes as default\nroutes. This means that any media I\nselect to upload will automatically go\nto these default pipes.\nFor each pipe\nI created, PixelPipe created a routing\ntag. The routing tag explicitly tells\nPixelPipe where to upload the content\noverriding any default routes. If you\nwant your content routed to different\nphoto sets you can create a routing\npipe and tag for each one.\n\nAlso, given this:\n\nsince other developers are sure to create a similar product now that they know it is possible to upload 720p videos.\n\nIf you don't like the PixelPipe app, it shouldn't be too long before another solution pops up :)\nAccording to this page, an app called SmugMug is also 720p uploading enabled, however I couldn't find much in reference to that on their site.\nhttp://www.tuaw.com/2010/07/01/want-to-upload-720p-from-iphone-4-try-pixelpipe/\n\nA: The Flickr app will allow you to do this.\n\nA: There are many apps that do this.

{"text": "Q: Transferring an old iPhone after I upgrade? I'm about to upgrade from the iPhone 3G to the iPhone 4, and I'm not sure what will happen to my old device once my phone number is transferred.\nSpecifically, I want to give the old device to my girlfriend, who is on a AT&T non-smartphone. What will I have to do to move her to the iPhone 3G? Will she need to sign up for an iPhone specific data plan if I put the sim card in there? WIll it work like any old phone if I just put the simcard in there?\nIn short, I'm not sure what will happen, and what I need to do.\n\nA: I just did this myself - I upgraded to an iPhone 4 and gave my sister my iPhone 3G. I put her AT&T SIM inside and she was instantly able to send & receive calls and texts. Since she doesn't want to pay for data (yet), she used the new iOS 4 network setting to turn off cellular data. I have heard that AT&T scans their network and automatically adds data plans to 'smartphones', but so far this hasn't been the case.\nIf she does want to use data, have her call up AT&T and let them know about the phone switch on the plan and they can sign her up for the iPhone data plan - it's $15/month for 200MB and $25/month for 2GB. You may be able to do this yourself online - I haven't tried - but contacting AT&T is quick and relatively painless and is guaranteed to work.\nOne other thing - if her SIM is ancient (pre-3G), then you may need to get a new one that supports 3G from an AT&T retailer or call AT&T and they can ship you a new one. They may charge a nominal fee (~$10) for this service.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1820", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}
{"text": "Q: How can I recalibrate the touchscreen on my iPhone? When I tap on the bottom of my iPhone's screen it actually acts as if I tapped in another section higher up. It may be a calibration problem. How can I recalibrate the touchscreen?\n\nA: The iPhone's capacitive touch screen doesn't have the concept of calibration.\nTo fix the problem you're experiencing, I suggest trying each of the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hard reset of the phone by holding the Home and Sleep buttons for 10 seconds.\n\n*\"Reset All Settings\" from Settings \u2192 General \u2192 Reset.\n\n*\"Erase All Content and Settings\" from Settings \u2192 General \u2192 Reset.\n\n*If your phone is still under warranty or covered by AppleCare, bring it to Apple and they will repair or replace it for you.\n\n*If not covered, then there are guides for replacing the front panel (first-gen iPhone), which contains the digitizer.\n\nA: If you have a protective case where the edge of the case is raised above the glass face of the phone, it may be ever-so-slightly pushing your touch points more towards the middle of the phone. This alters where the phone is expecting you to touch, and can cause the issues you are describing.\n\nA: I just recently had this problem. After some panic, and consideration of replacing my digitizer, I calmed down and looked at my phone carefully.\nKeep in mind that an iphone works on capacitance, with the glass plate being an insulating layer just on top of the sensing array. \nOn inspecting my phone, I discovered that the bottom right corner  of the glass face(to the right of the home button holding the phone in portrait orientation)had become flush with the top of the chrome strip which runs so elegantly around my 3g. It's not supposed to be flush. The glass top on a 3g/gs should be slightly higher. \nI powered down and removed my sim card, removed the screws at the bottom and re positioned the face properly. \nGood news? I returned to proper working order. Bad news? it doesn't last. Most likely I will have to replace the digitizer. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1822", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "9"}}

{"text": "Q: What file type/extension is used to store data for iPhone apps? I'm thinking about recovering the data on my bricked iPhone, but the hard drive recovery company would probably need to know what file types I want to recover. Most applications store their data in SQLite databases. When I sync to my computer, it saves this in a .mddata file. I'm guessing this file type is only used for the backup process.\nWhat file type/extension is used to store the data on the iPhone?\nI realize that apps can probably store it in whatever format they want. I want to know what's the default (or most likely) format for those that store their data in SQLite files.\n\nA: I'm not sure if you want to know about storage on the iPhone itself, or storage by iTunes in the backups, so I'll take a stab at both. :)\nSee here for a more in-depth analysis, but the basic gist is that the .mddata files are typically SQLite databases (occasionally encrypted), while the corresponding .mdinfo files are the metadata associated with them. (Older versions of iTunes used .mdbackup files.)\nHere's a more practical description of retrieving data from an existing iPhone/iPod backup, and another one which does so with the more recent format. Also, there's this presentation that dives into the format a bit. Here's a blog entry about deciphering the obfuscated filenames, and finally, here's a StackOverflow discussion about decrypting the encrypted .mddata files (which didn't end in a resolution of any kind).\nOn the iPhone itself, many applications store their data in a SQLite database directly because of the simplicity of doing so. Also, the Core Data ORM uses it under the hood, although that's really just an implementation detail.\nBut, as you've noted, there's no requirement to use SQLite; applications can store data in something as simple as a plain text file or XML document, or as complicated as a database of their own making.\n\nA: If an application uses Core Data with SQLite, the file extension will be .sqlite.\nAs @esm pointed out, some apps also use .sql and .sqlite3.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1831", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

The calendars end up in a set of subfolders, depending on how you end up configuring it. That said, I don't know how the same thing would look on the iPhone.\nWhat I do and recommend would be to continue using IMAP for GMail access--there's nothing wrong with it and you don't gain anything by moving to exchange. I do use Google Sync for contacts and calendars since it's the closest I can get to the functionality of MobileMe for free, and I'm very happy with it. For desktop access (aside from the webapp) I like BusyMac (post hyperlink limit reached; Google it) Software's products: one is an iCal superset clone and another is a sync utility that makes your Google Calendars show up in iCal just like MobileMe would.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1839", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

Suppose I'm in the range of a wifi network and I check my email on my iPhone.\nWill it try to use the wifi network first and only if that fails attempt to connect to 3G? Or will it always use 3G (with the charges that carries) regardless of other mediums?\nIs it automatic? Do I have to manually disable 3G connection if I want it to use wifi?\n\nA: The iPhone will always try to connect to the wifi if it is in range. If it already knows how to connect it will do so automatically. If it does not know it will notify you that there are wifi networks available.  \nBut to come back to the situation you described:\nIf it is already connected to the wifi it will use that for all data even if it is also connected to a 3G network.\n\nA: Wifi is always preferred over radio (3G/EDGE/GPRS) so if you want to force cellular data, you have to turn off wifi or un-join whatever networks are in range and/or disable auto-join. There is no failover, so if you get connected to a wifi that has no route to the Internet, the phone won't figure that out and use the cell data. You have to manually get off that wifi before the data will flow over the cellular network..\nI often turn off WiFi when I know 3G is faster than certain busy times at coffee shops or when my home ISP is overloaded.\nWhen traveling I've heard anecdotes that even with a wifi connection, some data was billable over cell connection as a roaming charge but can't say if that is still true or was a bug or was user error.

{"text": "Q: Can you solve these intermittent audio problems with Ford Sync and iPhone? Most of the time my iPhone 3GS works well with the Ford SYNC system (based on Microsoft Auto/Windows CE) in my Mercury Milan Hybrid.  I connect the iPhone to the car's USB input (inside the center console) and select \"USB\" on the \"Media\" screen.  It will start automatically playing whatever was most recently playing on the iPhone (which is usually a podcast for me).\nThe iPhone also plays well through Bluetooth (using the A2DP profile, I presume).  I prefer USB though because the steering wheel controls for next/previous track (and fast-forward & rewind) don't work over Bluetooth (probably because iOS doesn't support AVRCP), and the volume is significantly lower over Bluetooth than when using USB.\nIt feels like increasingly often I can't get audio to play over USB.  I will sometimes see a message saying something like \"Autoplay not supported\", and it won't play if I select a track (or podcast) on the Ford Sync screen.  Disconnecting and reconnecting the iPhone doesn't help, and I usually continue to have the problem even after turning off the car and opening the door to turn off Ford Sync.  (Though usually it works again the next time I drive the car.)\nWhen this happens Bluetooth still works, though the USB problem occurs sometimes when the Bluetooth connection drops.  I can manually reconnect the iPhone over Bluetooth, and then the USB doesn't work.\nI believe I noticed these intermittent problems before I upgraded my iPhone 3GS to iOS 4.0.  But they may be more frequent since then.\nHas anyone else run into these problems?  Have you learned anything I haven't?\nUpdate: The last time this happened I turned off audio (by pressing the volume dial).  USB worked when I turned it back on.  I'll keep my fingers crossed that this works whenever USB stops working.\nUpdate #2: Nope, turning off the audio and back off doesn't work.  If when I switch to USB I don't see the track name, then in a few seconds the audio will stop.  And I've never successfully got it to work again, without turning off the car and waiting several hours. (I don't know if it always displays \"Autoplay not supported when this happens.)\nI don't know whether this is related, but occasionally when playing audio over Bluetooth, the Bluetooth symbol will disappear from the screen and the audio will stop.  When I got to the phone settings, the phone I've paired with Sync isn't displayed.  If I wait a minute or two, the paired phone will be displayed and I can reconnect.\nI guess I should look and see if there's an update to Sync available.\nUpdate #3: I've noticed that sometimes when playing audio over USB the Bluetooth symbol will disappear from the my car's Sync screen (as described above).  The audio immediately stops, and won't start again until I reconnect to my iPhone over Bluetooth.  (This is somewhat annoying, since Bluetooth shouldn't have anything to do with USB.)\nI like the Ford Sync system, but it appears my worries about Microsoft's tendencies towards inferior quality and lack of attention to detail were not entirely unfounded.\nUpdate #4: I've discovered (accompanied with a face-palm) that I can crank the volume on my iPhone to max to come close to the same volume over the car speakers that I get over USB.  And I don't know if it was the iOS 4.2 upgrade (with AVRCP support\u2014which works well except for fast-forward and rewind), but the problem I describe in update #3 has been rare lately.  So I use Bluetooth most of the time and don't subject myself to the USB problems described above.  Bluetooth has the additional advantage of starting automatically from where I left off when I start my car.\n\nA: I don't have an answer, but I have the identical problem with an iPhone 3G.  The sync system will recognize USB for about a month and then start failing until it flat out won't recognize anything device that is inserted into the USB port.  I've had the guys at the dealership look at it 3 times and each time they get it to start working again by upgrading the sync software or it just happens to start working.\nHave you found a solution beyond using Bluetooth?  I can't even charge my phone anymore through the port.\n\nA: [Ford Sync Gen1, V3.1 (the latest for my 2010 Ford Contour).\niPhone 4, iOS 5.0]\nPlaying music via BlueTooth: \"volume\", \"next track\" and \"previous track\" steering wheel controls work, but does not show track info on the dashboard.\nPlaying music via USB: does show track info on the dashboard, and (new with iOS5) \"volume\", \"next track\" and \"previous track\" steering wheel controls work.\n*problem.  To get USB sound I start the music on the iPhone, then plug in the USB cable, then (by voice) switch to USB.  Switching directly from Bluetooth to USB seems to be working, but there is no sound.  If I unplug USB, plug USB, switch (by voice) to USB, then I do get sound.  At least I don't have to wait several hours like you!\n\nA: The problem is a faulty Apple design. They automatically route audio to the last connected destination. What you are describing is the Bluetooth connecting after the USB connection and even though in the vehicle you have USB selected the phone is routing audio to Bluetooth. If you disconnect the bluetooth or turn it off on the phone then the USB will always work.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1849", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

{"text": "Q: How do I create a custom ringtone for my iPhone? The iPhone has a very limited selection of default ringtones.\nHow do I create a new ringtone for my iPhone?\n\nA: Honestly, on windows iRinger  is one of the easiest ways. Choose an audio file select the segment you want, adjust, click \"Export\" and it's in iTunes\nSimple and easy\n\nA: This solution requires Mac OS X, but is otherwise free:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the audio file you want to make into a ringtone in QuickTime Player. If the file is a song in iTunes, control-click on the file and select \"Show in Finder\", then open QuickTime Player and drag the file from the Finder to the QuickTime Player icon in the dock.\n\n*If the audio file is longer than 40 seconds, you will need to trim it down:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the menu bar, select Edit -> Trim... and the scrubber will turn into a selector for the desired start and end.\n\n*Move the start and end so the selection is not more than 40 seconds. It's best to err on the side of caution and not go above 39.75 seconds.\n\n*Click \"Trim\"\n\n\n*From the menu bar, select File -> Export... and save as an \"Audio Only\" file on your desktop or other convenient location.\n\n*Download MakeiPhoneRingtone from Rogue Amoeba and launch the app.\n\n*Drag the file exported from QuickTime Player into the MakeiPhoneRingtone window. It will be automatically converted to the appropriate file format to be a ringtone and imported into iTunes.\nI have successfully created several ringtones for my iPhone using this method.\n\nA: *\n\n*If the song/sound you want to use isn't already in your iTunes library, add it to your iTunes library first.\n\n*If you want to use just a part of the song/sound, right click it, select \"Get Info\", then \"Options\" tab, and enter a start and stop time there. Remember, ringtones can't be over 40 seconds!\n\n*On the File menu, select \"Convert\" > \"Create AAC Version\". If you don't have this option, go to Edit, Preferences, General tab, and click the Import Settings button. Make sure the import setting is set to \"iTunes Plus\" (AAC).\n\n*This will create a new file in your iTunes library. Delete it from your iTunes library now, but be sure to check \"keep file\" in the delete dialog so the file itself isn't removed, just the library entry.\n\n*Navigate to where the file was created on disk, somewhere like music\\iTunes\\iTunes Music\\{artist}\\{album}\n\n*Rename the file from .m4a to .m4r\n\n*Drag and drop this .m4r file into the Ringtones folder of your iTunes (or, just double-click it and iTunes will handle it automatically).\n\n*Sync your iPhone. Make sure that \"Sync Ringtones\" is selected in the phone sync options (mine was off by default).\nAfter syncing, you can select your new ringtone in Settings, Sounds at the Custom section at the top.\n\nA: You can create or import a song in the IOS version of Garageband directly on your phone, and then export it as a ringtone which will appear in the ringtone list under Settings. \nOnce you have created your song by using any of the virtual instruments or importing an actual song:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to My Songs (the top left icon), and long-press on the song your created.\n\n*A Share menu will appear which contains among other options an item named Ringtone.\n\n*Enter the ringtone name and save it.\n\n*Go to Settings > Sounds and assign your new ringtone.\n\n\nNo need to pay anything, you don't need a Mac or iTunes, and you are only using free Apple software.\nThere is a more detailed tutorial here.\n\nA: iPhone ringtones are just AAC songs, no longer than 40 seconds, with an M4R extension, instead of the usual M4A that iTunes uses.\nYou can make the ringtones using iTunes itself. Just make a copy of the song and set the start and end position so that the song doesn't run longer than 40 seconds.\nThere are some apps that do that for you. I have use Ringer and Ringtones, on the Mac, and both worked pretty well.\n\nA: One other option that costs $1.99 in the App Store -- iRingtones\nI use it and like it. Although I wish I knew about the GarageBand method before. :-)\n\nA: The easiest solution is to get Fission.app and use it to crop the tracks (as ringtones can only be up to 40 seconds long) and export it in .m4r ringtone format.\nFission.app is not free, but there\u2019s a trial version.\n\nThat said, if you\u2019re looking for a solution that doesn\u2019t require third-party software, see your own answer.\n\nA: I haven't used it recently, but in the past I've had good results with this website: http://audiko.net/\nAssuming it still works with the iPhone 4, it's rather an easier process: you just upload your MP3, trim it to your liking using the flash interface, download the ringtone file, and drag it into iTunes.  Good luck!\n\nA: Alternatively, if you're using a Mac, you could just fire up Garageband. Here's a quick tutorial on Lifehacker:\nhttp://lifehacker.com/334073/create-custom-iphone-ringtones-the-free-and-apple-way\n\nA: For those of you with jailbroken iOS devices, there are at least three paid Cydia apps that can do both the ringtone conversion and adding (the adding part is not allowed for App store apps) directly on the device: AnyRing, Bridge and AudioExplorer+. (Disclosure: I am the developer of AudioExplorer+). You would of course still need to transfer the audio file to the device, but jailbroken devices also offer more ways to do this (like scp for example).\n\nA: I always use Ringer.org to make free ringtones for my iPhone. It's completely free and easy.\n\nA: We can make our own custom ringtones using garageband that you might already know. But it can only access the music that are non Apple music. When you create a ringtone .m4r on a computer and then sending into music app via the iTunes, the sound quality reduces. So the best solution is to use garageband. But the song should be in your music library before you can do that. And to add music into your library of your iPhone through iTunes you need to turn off iCloud music library that deletes all the Apple music in your device. So here is the solution \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to pc/macbook.\n\n*Open iTunes in it.\n\n*Open the iPhone and go to apps on the side menubar.\n\n*Now go to garageband app and add the song that you want.\n\n*After adding the song disconnect the iPhone.\n\n*Now the song is available in your garageband library.\n\n\nIt is the best way to make a custom ringtone. \n\nA: I like this way to do it because it is simple and once you have the script installed you can do it all in itunes without having to navigate anywhere else.\nI use Doug's apple scripts \" make ringable \" script. \nmake ringable script page \nYou download the script, put it in the script folder. he has instruction on how to do this and use his scripts on his web site.   Before you use the script, in itunes select the song you want to use and use command I to open up the metadata info box for it. adjust the start and stop point for the section you want to use ( 40 seconds or shorter ) and close the info box. \nTo make a ringtone out of the song you just manipulated you single click on the song so it highlighted then click on the script menu in the tool bar at the top of iTunes, click on the \"make ringable\" script in the drop down menu. Follow the instructions in the pop up box. It makes a ringtone of the song you selected and places it in the tones library. You can then go back and set the song time parameters back to where they were. When you sync your iphone choose to sync tones and voil\u00e0 you have your new ringtone(s) on your phone. \n\nIf you like it and use it, Donate to Doug on his web page for the time and effort he put into writing the script. I did.\n\n\nA: I've used this method before, and I find it very reliable. I didn't create it though, and I don't want to take credit for it (plus I don't have the required pictures to match) so here is a very useful link that you can use to learn how to make your very own ringtones, using iTunes!\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1884", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "42"}}

If you're using the new iOS 4 on a multitasking-compatible iPhone (3Gs and 4), there's IM+ Lite, which provides multitasking support so that you can stay connected even when you're not running the app.\n\nA: Trillian for iPhone is a multi-protocol IM client that supports Jabber among many others.  It's $5, but it's solid, good looking, and supports push notifications of IM messages.  The push notifications are nice because you'll still receive messages if you're in another app or the phone is in standby mode.\n\nA: I've used Meebo (iPhone only) and Beejive (seperate binaries for iPhone and iPad, link goes to iPhone). Both links go to iTunes. I own, use, and love Beejive, though I was quite miffed that I had to repurchase it for the iPad, and that they don't sync account data.\nBeejive backgrounds, but it does not contain the connection on your device. You can close Beejive and kill it, and your connections will continue to run. This is because Beejive's servers maintain the connection for a specified period of time. (Specified in Settings.app -> Beejive section.) You will be notified by push or e-mail (configurable!) when you have a new message, if Beejive is not running. If Beejive is running, you'll get a \"local notification\". A notification generated by the app itself with the message content.\nSome other clients run the connection FROM the device itself, and disconnect when the app is closed.\nThis is a security consideration you have to make when choosing an IM client for iOS.\n\nA: A couple of friends of mine use monal, they say it is decent for a free app...\n\nA: Since I can't put a comment yet, I will use \"answer\" posibility to comment given answers :) \nFirst of all, Gnoupi forgot to mention an important detail - we are searching for a jabber client for iPhone which we could use to connect with friends who are using other clients on pc.\nI tried Trillian, it does look nice, indeed, but seems it gives possibility to contact only people with Trillian accounts? \nTried Monal too, but it keeps hanging on \"logging in\", so can't even see if this is this what we search for :) \nIM+ Lite - I just read a description and indeed, this one seems to match our needs the best, I will give it a try! \n\nA: Monal IM\nWorks well with open Jabber servers. Even connecting using SSL.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1902", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "13"}}

{"text": "Q: Why is the top button on my iPhone 3Gs not working consistently? My iPhone 3Gs got slightly damp (not wet) from being in my pocket in a rain storm.  Since then, the top button (power on/off) is not working consistently.  By that, I mean that sometimes when I hold the button down, the screen goes black as expected.  Other times, nothing happens, and I have to press it multiple times to get the iPhone to respond.  My iPhone 3G had the same type of issue that began after being exposed to salt-spray air at the beach.\nI couldn't find any real information about the problem online using obvious search terms (iPhone 3Gs top button problems, iPhone top button problems, iPhone power button problems, etc).  \nAny ideas for easy solutions?  The phone's a year old (just out of warranty, not that water damage would be covered anyway), and I was hoping it'd last at least another few months.  I'm capable of basic repairs, but my skill with a soldering iron is limited, at best.  \n\nA: I'm afraid you've busted your iPhone. There's no easy solution.\nThat power button is known to be a weak spot, and submitting the phone to excess humidity (or direct moisture) is never a good idea, even if you weren't planning to be in that storm. \nFrom your description it sounds like the switch is slowly corroding. It will not get better, only worse over time. I'd suggest to have the phone serviced as long as it's otherwise still in good condition, or give up and replace it sooner than planned.\nYou could also try to repair it yourself by opening it up and cleaning that switch, but it might not even be possible, and worse: you risk breaking your phone. Have it serviced instead.\n\nA: If you feel brave, you can replace the part yourself. I recently followed this procedure to replace the headphone jack, which is actually part of the same circuitry as the power switch. It took a couple of hours and was a bit nerve-wracking, but all reasonably straight-forward.\nUnfortunately my headphone jack is still broken :-( but the rest of the phone is fine.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1924", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: How to unlock iPhone after completing the contract without jail breaking? My iPhone 3G contract was completed a while ago. I have the 3GS now. I would like to give it to someone else who is not on AT&T. I called AT&T and they wouldn't do anything about it. I heard it can be unlocked after jail breaking. Is there an alternative? What happens if I jail break, unlock and then restore? Would it still be unlocked?\n\nA: Official iPhone unlocking can be done and is handled by Apple. You need to call your mobile phone operator, ask for the unlock, and they contact Apple (or have a special application, I don't know) where they will send your phone's IMEI.\nAfter a few days, when you sync your iPhone, iTunes will show you a screen telling you your iPhone has been unlocked.\n\nA: Calling the carrier is the right thing to do. They are the ones that are responsible for unlocking the phone.\nAt least it is that way in Germany.\nPerhaps trying again to call AT&T does help. In my experience calling a hotline again if the first operator cannot handle your request to your liking does help. Sometimes one just gets a bad call center agent or the agent had a bad day.\n\nA: This is an old question, but I'm adding an (AT&T and possibly US specific) answer, as it seems AT&T's policies have changed since the question was first asked. And there are some new answers suggesting paid unlock services that are not necessary.\nAT&T's current (April, 2013) policy is that they will unlock iPhones if all the following are true:\n\nAT&T will unlock an iPhone under the following circumstances:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The person requesting the unlock is:\n  \n*\n  \n*A current AT&T customer, or \n  \n*A former AT&T customer who can provide\n  the phone number or account number for the account. \n  \n  \n*The iPhone was\n  designed for use on the AT&T network. \n  \n*All contract obligations,\n  including any term commitment, associated with the device to be\n  unlocked have been fully satisfied. \n  \n*The iPhone has not been reported\n  lost or stolen.\n  \n\nThis is covered on AT&T's web page. The current link is http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB414532\n\nA: Note: this requires a jailbreak.\nThere is a tool called ultrasn0w. If you are running a supported baseband (I believe if you are running iOS 6+ up) then it will unlock the phone.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1935", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}
{"text": "Q: How can I hide the onscreen keyboard in the iOS messaging app? When I enter the text message / SMS \"app\" and tap on the input field a keyboard pops up. When I'm done writing and have sent the message I would like to dismiss the keyboard again. I haven't found out how to so this.\nThe best work around I have found is to leave and enter the conversation.  But surely there must be a better way. How can you do this or is it even possible at all? I have tried almost everything. \n\nA: If you turn your phone sideways, the keyboard is slightly different and has a few different command keys on the sides. The one next to \"return\" will hide the keyboard. Then simply turn your phone back up and the keyboard stays hidden until you click for it to come back. I found scrolling up in the message will hide the keyboard. But this only works in the SMS screen, it does not work in apps like Google Docs, whereas turning it sideways does.\n\nA: Found new trick in ios 13 to hide the keyboard.\n\n\n*\n\n*From the page where you want to hide the keyboard, open notification area by sliding the screen from top.\n\n*Swipe right to go to Search panel from notification area.\n\n*Click on search input box.\n\n*Now just swipe up the screen from down to close search panel.\n\n*now keyboard will be disappear from the application. \n\n\nA: Double-tapping the message area with one finger minimizes the keyboard.\n\nA: This is not possible at all right now.\nLike you said, you can back out and go in again to dismiss keyboard.\nOther option is to tap the 'edit' button on top right. That will dismiss keyboard but it will go in edit mode. When you cancel out of edit mode keyboard will come back.\nApple should do something to easily bring up and dismiss keyboard...\nUpdate: With iOS 5, you can swipe messages down all the way pushing the keyboard downwards. Initially I thought, \"why not just swipe down the keyboard itself to dismiss?\" But now it makes sense because you start scrolling down to see previous messages and keyboard naturally goes away when you do that.\n\nA: 'backspace' then all sms's then back to conversation and the keyboard appears minimized. \n\nA: If you have an apple bluetooth keyboard you can hit the eject button on it to close/open it, other than that I don't think you can.\n\nA: I just play around with it trying to hide it and I found out how to hide the keyboard. Pull down the conversation in a fast motion. Like swiping down the page to earlier messages quickly. The keyboard will go away. I hope it helps! :)\n\nA: You can touch a spot right between the message text field and where the messages display and drag (not swipe) down to hide it. It's a little tricky to get the right spot, you'll have to find it through trial and error. Good luck!\n\nA: This gets on my nerves too but if you tap edit in the top right, the keyboard minimises until you press cancel . Although it doesn't let you load earlier conversations, it's useful if you want to read over a long text that you're replying to or something.\n\nA: all you have to do is toggle the keyboard downward to dismiss it and it will go away just gently motion the keyboard down with your index finger and it will go away \n\nA: When you want to dismiss the keybord you type \"Return\".\n\nA: Press and hold the keyboard icon and press \u201cdock\u201d to move the keyboard out of your way so that you can see what you are typing.\n\nA: Solution: Use the named touchesBegan like below  \noverride func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {\n        view.endEditing(true)\n}\n\n\nA: In ios 16.2, with phone in vertical position, in the text input box, touching and dragging down with one's finger hides the keyboard.\n\nA: Tap the area where the messages are with 2 fingers, this minimises the keyboard. \n\nA: My friend simply had to reset my settings...and the keyboard panel went away\n\nA: Rather than swiping downward, take your index finger and drag downward on the left side of the message area.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1938", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "26"}}
{"text": "Q: How does Facetime compare to normal video calling? So, Apple is billing Facetime as though it is a revolutionary technology. I'm not going to ask you whether you think it is, as that is clearly a subjective question. What I will ask instead is how does it compare to normal video calling. Is there anything new that hasn't been done before?\n\nA: Entirely new? No - not really, but the quality is quite acceptable (I'd say it's better than most Skype video calls I've had) and it's extremely painless to use. It's also at the present time far more limited in audience (only iPhone 4's, iPad 2's and Macs) than normal video calling.\nYou can think of it as video calling built right into the OS with software that doesn't require hoops (no log in required) to jump through to use it.\n\nA: As for your question, Is there anything new that hasn't been done before, then one could be generous and say that the no-account-required and it-just-works is quite nice, as is the elegant use of front or rear cameras and the ability to switch between them, and the automatic landscape/portrait modes. That's quite slick. But it's not a competition-killer.\nOn the whole, Facetime is the typical Apple feature -- very polished, but a limited feature-set, and only available to users on the exact same platform (in this case, only iPhone 4's, iPad 2's and Macs). That alone limits the usefulness of the app quite a bit.\nFor general-purpose video calling, there are general-purpose apps like Skype which do it better, and which even work over 3G (if you're lucky), and which aren't limited to specific Apple-only devices.\nI'd recommend Skype over Facetime any day.\n(Notice I didn't comment on the revolutionary issue either.)\n\nA: You're obviously well aware of the long history of video calling implementations to ask this question, so  \n\n\n*\n\n*Having an idea is trivially easy.\n\n*Implementing it well is hard.\n\n*Implementing it so you don't get\nsued is even harder.\n\n*Driving substantial user growth or taking over user share in adopting your implementation is the ultimate challenge.\n\n\nApple's hype and I would presume most non-hater's hope is that they are shooting for no less than #4 above. If you consider implementation and support costs of a video chat system as well as voice and picture quality, it's hard to say anyone is beating them at #2 either. One could easily see the desktop client catching up to Skype in short order but no-one is even close for mobile devices and two way video.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1940", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: iPhone 3G GPS is unreliable; seems to use assisted-gps only A few months ago the GPS in my 3G has become really unreliable.  The blue circle in google maps looks to be about 2 miles in diameter, and never shrinks to a pinpoint.  Apps like RunKeeper can never get a strong enough GPS signal.  This may have coincided with the iPhone not picking up wifi unless almost on top of the access point, but that could have been a coincidence.\nThings I've tried that haven't worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Trying to lock on to a satillite when outside with clear skys for >30 minutes\n\n*General Settings -> Network -> Cellular Data -> Reset Settings\n\n*Restoring the iPhone from a back-up\n\n*Giving the phone a prelonged stern look\n\n\nAny ideas greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The prelonged stern look didn't work??? Lol \nI see that you tried restoring from a backup. Try restoring to stock software instead of your saved backup and see how it works. I've noticed that sometimes erratic behavior is caused by corrupted files within the actual backup image.\nIf that doesn't work, try taking it in for service...I really don't think that's necessary though.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: It sounds like the receiver chip is malfunctioning. If your 3G is still under warranty, return it to the store for service!\nSomething similar happened to my 3G: it would no longer find any Bluetooth devices, and no wifi networks even when I entered the network settings manually. I tried hard for weeks to make this work again, even restoring/upgrading etc. but in the end it turned out that the radio chip had died... After a long and phoneless week, I received a brand new replacement 3G from the store.\n\nA: Bear in mind that A-GPS is by no means less precise than GPS. The A(ssisted) technology consists of the phone using the Radio (phone) network to query about the Satellites\u2019 information, the GPS receiver only has to care for the \u201ctime\u201d information from each satellite, instead of the full pack of information (which is usually lost in poor reception areas like cities anyway). So, A-GPS, by combining info coming from the Cell antenna about the Satellites, and squeezing what it can from the real GPSs messages, can pinpoint your more or less accurate location. In a perfect world, you\u2019d have 6 or more satellites telling you all the information\u2026\nIf you\u2019re not getting a good location, then I suggest you do what has been suggested, try a fresh \u201cinstall\u201d (you can later try to restore) or take the phone for service, the GPS Receiver may be failing. \nApart from the cell radio to obtain the info, the iPhone also uses wi-fi (if available).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1952", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I watch an AVI file on my iPhone? I understand that the bundled apps for iPhone does not support AVI files. However, I have lots of these files which I want to watch on my iPhone. \nCan you suggest a streamlined, automatic way of doing this? I have never watched videos on my iPhone or iTunes before and would appreciate step by step answers.\n\nA: Use HandBrake to easily convert the AVI files to an iPhone compatible format then sync those converted files with your iPhone\nOr, email/post them to Posterous, and they'll be auto-converted into a format watchable on your iPhone\n\nA: There are plenty of apps which will allow your iPhone to support .avi files...\nFor starters, there is the all-time favorite VLC (free) . You get the file-support and the friendly user interface like you're used to on your Mac.\nThen there is AcePlayer ($2.99) which will even support more files, is extremely user friendly and this app is close to my favorite.\nBut my all time favorite app is CineX-Player ($1.99). \nThey tend to do some actions where you can get this app with a discount (or even free).\nAll of these apps are easily managed by iTunes File Sharing:    \n\nThey all support a lot of files (including your requested .avi), subtitles and they all have a nice and clear interface. I can highly recommend CineX-Player, but VLC is great as well and it's free!\n\nA: Quicktime will do this too: File \u2192 Save as and then choose iPhone from the format list.\n\nA: There are a lot of apps that support this. The best I've found is yxplayer in the app store or yxflash from Cydia (same thing for free, but requires jailbreak) -- good compatability, fast with non-HD content, etc. You can move the files over using either iTunes or any program that let's you access the filesystem like iPhoneBrowser, then watch them without the need for any conversions.\nConversion is not a good option:\n\n\n*\n\n*Slow (often about 2/3 the length of the video, so you need to plan ahead)\n\n*Lossy (you will lose quality)\n\n*Larger files (usually)\n\n*Generally a pain in the ass\n\n\nIf you must convert, HandBrake (like the accepted answer suggests) is good but doesn't support all formats - xvid4psp in my experience is slightly better.\nIf you want to convert MKV files with embedded ASS/SSA subtitles (having spent >5 hours looking for a program that will work for this), version 4 of xvid4psp (doesn't work on Win7 x64) is the only program that will do this. v5/v6 of xvid4psp, HandBrake, etc, etc. will not work.\n\nA: Buzzplayer from the App Store plays AVI files and even embeds srt subtitles.\n\nA: I'm a big fan of flex:player for iPad, iPhone (3GS and above), and iPod touch (3rd gen. and above).\nflex:player will play the AVI file without conversion. You simply have to transfer the file.\n\nTo transfer the AVI file, you can use iTunes file sharing.\n\nBear in mind that, depending on your device, you might experience stuttering if the video is HD. The iPhone 4 and above should be able to handle 720p content just fine, though.\n\nA: I suggest  VLC for iOS. AVI is a \"container\" for many different video formats (codecs). VLC could be a good viewer for many of the different video formats that AVI supports. When starting the VLC for the first time it has a good wizard that tells you what to do step by step.\nThis is a brief step by step way of doing it:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Download VLC for iOS in Appstore on your iPhone\n\n*Connect your phone to your computer\n\n*Open iTunes on your computer\n\n*Select the iPhone icon\n\n*Select Apps Scroll down to File Sharing\n\n*Select VLC\n\n*In VLC Documents click Add... and upload your AVI file\n\n*Open VLC on your iPhone\n\n*Select All Files\n\n*Click your AVI file\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1956", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "9"}}

I have an iPhone 3G 16GB with iOS 4.0.2 and my wifi is not working, I tried to fix it with reset network settings and other quick fixes like that but it still doesn't work. Sometimes it sees wifi networks but I can't connect. I don't think is a hardware problem because I can see the wifi MAC address on the device.\nVersion: 4.0.2 (8A400) (jailbreak with redsnow)\nModem Firmware: 05.13.04\nPS: On 3.1.2 the same thing.

But since you say that your phone sometimes does see a wifi network, there's hope that the hardware is okay.\nFirst, follow the comments posted here to make sure you're running a completely normal OS without any hacks or modifications.  \nThen, here's Apple's description of how to reset the network settings.\nLastly, if it still won't work, check my link above.\n\nA: It seems that many users of 3G experienced the same problem with WIFI when uphgraded to iOS 4\nPerhaps some of the solutions listed here would help. In you case you are probably left with the the last option\n\nRestore, but not from a backup. One less-than-ideal fix for this issue\n  involves restoring the iPhone as a new\n  device rather than from a backup. It\n  appears that bad holdover data from\n  iPhone backups can cause loss of data\n  access. Restoring as a new phone will\n  delete contacts and other data, but\n  generally resolves this problem.\nTo do so, connect your iPhone or iPod\n  touch to your computer, click\n  \u201cRestore\u201d in iTunes, then choose\n  \u201csetup as new phone.\u201d\n\n\nA: Try a stock (un-jailbroken) ipsw file from scratch. Use this procedure to downgrade properly.\nI think that when you restore using your jailbroken image, you're just putting the problem back onto to the device. I've noticed that even after a brick, when I restore with redsn0w, it's not a clean install, as my previous applications and settings are still there. I think a fresh install of stock firmware may help.

{"text": "Q: When does Safari on iPhone change the text size when the orientation changes? I've noticed that when I am browsing a web page in Safari on the iPhone and change the orientation from portrait to landscape, sometimes the text size and/or wrapping changes.\nFor example, in portrait there may be 10 words on a line, but when I turn it sideways the text size changes and there are maybe 8 or 12 words on that line. Usually when I turn it back to portrait again it stays at that number instead of going back to 10.\nI don't remember any specific examples off-hand but they were just regular sites (not mobile versions). Text appeared to be in a fixed column, it wasn't just wrapping to the entire window width.\nCan anyone clarify in what ways this is changed or determined?\n[also, I couldn't create 'safari' or 'zoom' tags]\n\nA: Here's an estimation:\nThe site you're likely viewing has what is called a liquid-layout, which means that the content will spread to fill it's container.  So when you're rotating the phone, the viewport width is changing from the narrower portrait width to the much longer landscape width.  So the text itself might not be changing size, the webpage is just adapting to fit it's new window size.\nLuckily the above link also has a liquid-layout, so you can see this in action.  Take the window on your computer and shrink it's width.  You'll notice that the text will shift around to fit it's new container size.

{"text": "Q: Is it OK to charge my iPhone with my iPad charger? I have an iPhone 4 and an iPad.  Since the iPad really charges best off the wall charger I keep it plugged in, but I usually just charge the iPhone off the computer.  Although frequently if the iPad is charged I will charge the iPhone with the wall charger.\nNow the Apple sales rep said he heard from someone who heard from someone that that would burn out the phone because the iPad charger is 10 watt instead of 5 watt.  It is true that it is twice as many watts.  I said that I thought it shouldn't burn out the phone because a device should only pull as many watts as it needs, so the watts were irrelevant.  He said that made sense, but he didn't really know.\nSo I thought I would ask the experts.  Has anyone had their iPad charger fry an iPhone or iPod?  Am I correct in my understanding of watts in chargers?  Is there an official word about the iPad charger causing trouble with other devices?  Have I already voided my warranty?\n\nA: TL;DR: Yes, you can use an iPad charger to charge an iPhone.\n\nBasic electrical laws apply. The USB specification is a nominal 5Volts. That applies to ALL USB devices and chargers. It has to be so for a UNIVERSAL (U) SERIAL (S) BUS (B) to be UNIVERSAL!! (Duh sounds obvious and it IS).\nSo your charger may deliver 2Amps at 5Volts => 10Watts (W=V*A)\nYour charger may be capable of delivering 3A. At 5V that implies it is capable of handling a (3A * 5V = 15W) load.\nOhms Law states that Current = Volts/Ohms. Therefore for a given resistance (Ohms) and a given Voltage there WILL be a given current.\nSo let's say your phone has a terminal resistance of 10 Ohms. the USB specification says that the USB supply voltage is 5V therefore the current your phone will draw is 5V divide by 5 Ohms = 1A\nYour 10W charger CAN (ideally) supply 2A at 5V which is 2 times what your phone needs, BUT the phone will ONLY draw a maximum of 1A BECAUSE that's all it needs and can draw due to its internal resistance and the charging circuitry which will limit it even more as the battery charges up.\nSo for the guy whose charger wires burned: the ONLY way that this could have happened is firstly if the charger wires were severely underrated and the current being drawn was more than they were capable of. This could only happen if the resistance at the end where you'd plug into your device got shorted out. The charger will not be at fault. UNLESS the charger was faulty - then it would have damaged any USB device you plugged it into.\nAs regards the phone that supposedly burned black: again the same thing. The charger can supply current only according to its capability and the resistance of the load (phone/ ipad, etc). The load device has a given idle resistance and charging circuitry to control and limit the charge current. The charger cannot supply more current than Ohm's law allows and also than what it is capable of delivering.\nSo the conclusion is that either your charger was faulty and its output voltage was greater than 5V, which would cause (push) a greater current to flow than the load device was capable of; OR your load device (phone, etc.) charging circuitry was faulty, which caused it to draw (pull) more current than it was supposed to.\nBottom line is that when all devices are functionally sound and non-faulty, it is impossible for you to burn it out by using a charger that has a higher rated wattage.\nUsing a charger with a lower rating can cause the charger to overheat and maybe fail as the load device will attempt to draw the charge current that it needs but the charger can only supply the maximum it is designed to supply.\nSo, for example, if you have a charger that can supply only 500mA @ 5V (i.e., 2.5W of power) then if your iphone, ipad, etc., tries to draw 1A or 2A, etc., the charger can supply max of ONLY 0.5A. So, Ohm's Law applies again.\nLet's once again assume that your load device is 5 Ohms.\nRemember Ohm's Law: V = I*R. Therefore, if I=0.5A and R=5 Ohms, then the charger voltage will fall to V = 5 * 0.5 = 2.5V  because the charger can deliver max of only 500mA.  So, if you draw too much current, the voltage will drop.\nTake the extreme: if you shorted out the charger terminals, the short circuit voltage is 0V and the short circuit current is 0.5A because the short circuit resistance is 0 Ohms.\n\nA: Your assumption is correct. Your iPhone has an intelligent charge controller on-board and this controller will only draw as much as it needs. \nSure, the iPad power supply can supply twice as much power as the iPhone needs, but it should not be dangerous by any means.\nI don't know if there is an \"official\" word on this, but I would be genuinely surprised that it voids your warranty. Apple engineers are very smart and know that users will interchange powersupplies if they recognize that the connectors are physically compatible (as is the case here.)\nLong story, short: you should be fine.\n\nA: The UK Apple store says the iPad charger is fine with iphones / nano\nhttp://store.apple.com/uk/product/MC359B/A?fnode=MTc0MjU4NjA&mco=MTc3Mzc5MDU\n\nA: Loads, such as a phone, draw as much current as required for their resistance (see Ohm's Law). Having a power supply that can supply more current than a device can use is not only possible, but basically universal. E.g. A MacBook charger can supply 65W of power max (at a constant voltage, this implies constant max current), but most of the time the MacBook will be drawing FAR less power (and thus less current).\nTL;DR: Yes, you can use an iPad charger to charge an iPhone.\n\nA: It will not \"hurt\" your iPhone, however with long term use and everyday charging with the larger amperage, you will damage your battery faster and it will start performing worse more quickly than it would normally.\nI recommend charging your iPhone with the standard 1 amp charger that is included with your iPhone. However, if you're in a pinch and need some extra battery fast, then using a larger amp charger won't destroy your iPhone.\nThe iPhone does not need 2.1 amps forced inside it, but it will handle it.\nPeople claim the iPhone is designed to handle more than 1 amp of power, such as the iPad's 2.1 amp brick. Just because there is a cutoff at the amount the iPhone will accept, (not sure what it is just over 2.1 amp I believe) doesn't mean shoving more than 1 amp of power inside it won't damage the internals. The power management chip and battery has to work with more power. (more heat, more wear) Also, using more than 1 amp will increase the temperature of the iPhone overall which is not good for a lot of parts of the phone.(glue, plastic)\nYes, Apple lists that the iPad charger is compatible with your iPhone. It does work, and won't cause noticeable harm for a while. Also, worst case scenario for Apple is you go and drop more money on a battery replacement. More heat and more power is never a good thing, and will cause long term damage and poor battery performance, with the possibility of other things failing faster. I have seen it first hand with my customers before. (I own a small business fixing iPhones) Things such as glue and plastic can loosen up and move. Screens sometimes will get small bubbles under them, screens will sometimes loosen up and require new glue to re secure them into their proper place. The customers that had those issues claimed they regularly charge with an iPad brick.\nSource\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2017", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "30"}}

The app would have to stop the driver for the current iPod from being installed and instead present a driver for the older device you want to emulate. Most likely your current device running the app would probably have to be jailbroke.

{"text": "Q: AppleCare for iPad I just picked up an iPad and the sales \"specialist\" was completely unconvincing for me to get the AppleCare extended warranty.  I realize the iPad is fairly new, so not a lot of failures yet, but I am curious if in general the extended warranty is worth while for a device like that.  The only thing I could think of was battery replacement if the battery performance falls off.\n\nA: Sadly, I had got pretty good mileage from Apple Care with my MBPro so I got one for iPad.\nIt has less moving parts but one part I expect to need repair is the main button, especially after iOS4 arrives and it will be used to switch between running apps with double-click\n\nA: I do get AppleCare for all my Macs, and will get AppleCare for an iPad whenever I buy one that I expect to use for more than 12 months.  Three of my last four Macs have benefited from it.\nI suspect I'll buy the 2011 iPad next year, so I decided an extended warranty wasn't needed on my 2010 iPad.\n\nA: Generally an extended warranty (and insurance in general) is not worthwhile if you can afford the loss.  By definition, insurers calculate the odds that they'll need to pay out a claim, and charge more than that (odds * payout) to make a profit.\nThe only reason to pay that surcharge is to protect against losses that would cause massive financial hardship.  If you can replace the item on short notice without going hungry or losing your home, you're probably better off self-insuring in the long run.\nThat being said, there are exceptions: most notably when you have better information than the insurer about your risks.  In other words, if you know you're much more likely to damage an item than the average user (and the insurance company considers you an \"average user\"), it might be a win to insure for accidental damage.\nFor this reason, I did actually go ahead and insure my iPad -- although I did so through SquareTrade, not Apple, as they offer a better product IMHO.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2032", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

{"text": "Q: What is the use of the Bluetooth on iPad? I would like to understand what other ways I can use Bluetooth on my iPad apart from connecting a physical keyboard.\n\nA: In addition to P2P sharing and audio streaming like Doug said, if you have a jailbroken 3G one, you can create a wifi hotspot using MiFi.\n\nA: Also, some emulators allow you to use a Wii controller via Bluetooth.\n\nA: There are Bluetooth-to-IR devices (for example) that let you control your TV and other devices from your iPad over Bluetooth.\n\nA: Tethering\nYou can \u201ctether\u201d your iPad to an iPhone to use its cellular data service as a \u201cmobile hotspot\u201d. For when you need internet access on-the-go.\nYou can do this via WiFi as well. Using Bluetooth instead may provide some advantages, such as saving on battery because the radio signal is weaker and needs less juice.\nFor details, see MacWorld article Use Bluetooth to tether your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad by Glenn Fleishman.\nBy the way, a third way to tether is via USB cable. \n\nA: Starting with iOS 7, Bluetooth on iPad (as well as other select iOS and Mac devices) can be used to exchange files and information wirelessly in an ad-hoc manner using a feature called AirDrop.\nBluetooth is also employed when setting up and communicating with other Apple devices like AirPods, HomePod and Apple TV. With Bluetooth turned on, even a new iOS device can be easily set up by transferring content using an iOS feature called Quick Start.\nAnother interesting application with Bluetooth turned on is to easily share Wi-Fi password with nearby iOS devices belonging to saved contacts without entering it manually. Instructions can be found in the 9to5Mac article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Easily share your WiFi with friends on iOS 11, automatically sends passwords to nearby devices\n\niOS 11 includes many automatic features regarding first-time setup and account login. This extends to WiFi networks too. If a friend comes over with an iPhone running iOS 11, you can automatically log them in to your WiFi in one tap.\n\n\nA: You can do peer-to-peer networking on bluetooth with some games and other applications.\nI haven't checked out the details but my understanding is that the Bluetooth profile is much better in the iPhone 4 and iPad than in the early iPhones.

Ideally, I would like to have something that adds the new video afterwards to my iTunes. \n\nA: I use RipIt to digitize my DVDs, it's dead simple.\nhttp://thelittleappfactory.com/ripit/\nRipIt will use a Handbreak extension to compress things in a second pass but I use Handbreak itself for that.\nWhen done I have two files: the ripped file uncompressed which I save on an external hard disk in case OS X's DVD Player ever gets AirPlay so I can play better quality movies through AppleTV, and the compressed file that Handbreak makes which I move into iTunes and sync with my iPad (and backup onto the external as well for safe keeping).\nHandbreak is also useful when you want subtitles in a foreign movie or want the extras on a DVD to be available; it lets you sort out the tracks and such although it's UI is a bit overwhelming.\nI have a 64GB iPad with over 20 full length movies on it at any one time and plenty of room for more.

Here is a blog post with some good info on settings to use for iPad rips/conversions.\nAs for getting videos added to iTunes automatically, that is not something Handbrake will do.  If you are using OS X however, this AppleScript seems like it would be up to the task.  The script watches a folder, when a file is copied in it waits for the file to stop getting larger (when the copy or encode [in this case] is finished) and then adds the item to your iTunes library.  I haven't had a chance to test this for myself though, so I can't guarantee it will work as desired.\n\nA: Miro Video Converter is quite good, simple and free, it is a choice.\nhttp://www.mirovideoconverter.com/\n\nA: If it's something you do a lot, you might consider investing in Elgato's Turbo.264 HD, which comprises a USB dongle that accelerates video conversions, and software for doing the conversion (which includes the \"add to iTunes\" functionality you asked for). The dongle is also compatible with one or two other video converters, such as Roxio's Toast.\nYou can also buy the Turbo.264 software on its own, either from Elgato or on the Mac app store, but at around US$50 it's hard to recommend... it doesn't really do anything that the cheaper or free converters can do. \n\nA: Alternatively if you don't wish to convert you can probably play the original video files through an application like AVPlayerHD which supports video formats that iTunes doesn't.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2069", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "12"}}
{"text": "Q: Can I change the location of the iTunes iPod Photo Cache folder? I want to sync photos on my Windows desktop with my iPad but when I set iTunes to Sync Photos from the My Pictures folder, iTunes creates an iPod Photo Cache folder (which is about the size of My Pictures folder which is 6 GB).  Letting iTunes create the folder is not the issue but I am syncing the \"My Pictures\" folder with my laptop and other computers and I do not want to have the iPod Photo Cache folder to also sync across my other computers.  Is there a way to change the location of where iTunes will put the iPod Photo Cache folder?  I did not see a setting in iTunes for it.\n\nA: Purpose of this folder:\n\nWhen iTunes synchronizes photos to your iPod, it actually converts and resizes them into 16-bit bitmaps in resolutions appropriate for the iPod. It stores the converted photos in the iPod Photo Cache folder before transferring them to the iPod. This basically allows iTunes to quickly add/remove photos from your iPod without having to reconvert them every time. If you remove a photo album/folder from your iPod (by unchecking the box in iTunes preferences), it will still leave the pictures in the cache in case you want to add them again in the future.\n\nPossible workaround:\n\nMove the iPod Photo Cache folder to the location of your choice, and make an alias (shortcut) to the folder in its new location. Place the alias in the folder where the iPod Photo Cache originally was (usually in the Pictures folder) and make sure the alias is named \"iPod Photo Cache\". When iTunes looks for the iPod Photo Cache folder in the Pictures folder, it will instead find the alias, directing it to the new location. \n\nYou didn't specify the OS of the computer but on Windows that would be a junction point.\n\nA: You need a second step to hide it from Live Mesh and also to make sure it doesn't show up in your Pictures view of Windows 7, etc.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync your photos, allowing iTunes to create the folder in your Pictures folder as usual\n\n*Copy that folder to a location out of the way, I like to use where iTunes keeps the rest of their data (and should put the photo cache IMHO):\n\n\nC:\\Users\\User Name\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\nNOTE: You can put it on a share or other drive if you wish, as long as you use a soft link (which we do below)\n3.Create the symbolic link. I use MKLINK from the Windows SDK.\nOpen the CMD window as Administrator and type:\ncd C:\\Users\\User Name\\Pictures\nMKLINK /D \"iPod Photo Cache\" \"C:\\Users\\User Name\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\iPod Photo Cache\"\nThen, you will see the folder appear in your Pictures folder with the familiar \"Shortcut\" arrow.\n4.Right-mouse-click that folder and select \"Hide Folder\"\nWhen it asks if you want to hide it just for that folder or all folder and files pick only for this folder \nTADA! Your iTunes (which knows the name and looks for it in code) will find the file and update the database correctly in it's new location, but any picture / file services (Zune, Windows Explorer, Live Mesh) will not pick up the directory.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2071", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: iPad with retina display? I'm about to buy an iPad, but I don't want to, if in 6 months, the new version has cooler features like retina display.\nIs there a chance for it to happen? Or should I buy it now, and just, enjoy it for the next months. \n\nA: IMHO I'd say the buy vs. wait is a problem is always there on all gadget purchases. The longer you wait the better off you will be (larger community of knowledgeable user, accessories, price, features, stability, etc.) On the other hand you could find yourself perpetually waiting and thats no fun\nPersonally I wait when\n1) A new product announcement has been made so I put off my purchase until the product is released. \n2) I have a product that fills my current need (in the case of an iPad a small laptop) and it still has some life in it.\n3) The technology is still in its infancy and its value is limited due to a low network effect (e.g. 3D TV)\nIn the case of the iPad I think only 2 is in play. \n\nA: I'm guessing it's likely there will be a CPU and most certainly a RAM upgrade in the next 6-8 months. Also it is clear that Apple wants to be the leader in the Ereader market and a better display would make a massive difference.\nSo yeah it's possible and my gut feel is that it is likely a retina display will ship in the next 6-8 months.  But only Apple knows and information rarely leaks out 6 months before launch. \nNonetheless, I am using an iPad to type this reply and to me it feels like a second generation device not a first gen device. It always works, battery life is awesome and its a real awesome device for browsing while sitting on the couch. Personally if I had a real use for an iPad I would buy it. You can always sell it on ebay in 5 months if you want the next gen   \n\nA: Maybe the right question to ask is: is current featureset of the gadget worth the money over the expected period (6-18 months) until the new version arrives ? If yes, go ahead. Waiting for better improved version may also mean you never get one as there is always going to be better version.\nWhat works for me is skip-one, buy-one approach, getting every second update. You can decide whether you start with version one or two: I had same dilema with iPhone: I skipped the version one, bought 3G, skipped 3GS and now considering getting iPhone 4 when it arrives to Canada.\nWith iPad, I bought one right away as I waited for eBook reader that works for me and iPad is definitely one. I will very likey skip iPad 2 and likely get iPad 3 2-3 years from now.\n\nA: Apple has update cycles ranging from 6 to 18 months, with the most popular consumer devices getting annual improvements. Many sites keep track of the history of devices such as this apple buying guide: \nMacRumors Buyer's Guide. \nApple has also gotten into trouble with consumers for dropping prices after they've squeezed their early adopters. Given historical precedent, Apple will realize the technical specs for the iPad are underpowered and they will likely release a new one at the year mark (April 2011) or even sooner. If you can wait 9 months, you can likely get more features or a secondhand device at a discount.\nYou can compare the tech specs for the screens on apples site.\nThe iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*9.7-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit glossy widescreen Multi-Touch display with IPS technology\n\n*1024-by-768-pixel resolution at 132 pixels per inch (ppi)\n\n\niPhone with Retina Display:\n\n\n*\n\n*3.5-inch (diagonal) widescreen Multi-Touch display\n\n*960-by-640-pixel resolution at 326 ppi\n\n\nThere isn't a direct correlation between the two devices. The iPad however is advertised as an HD video viewer supporting 720p. Apple may see no need to increase resolution beyond the current level for the next release, but 1080p support would appear to be the next logical resolution update.\n\nA: That's exactly why I'm holding off. I believe an iPad with retina display (and possibly camera) will be in the next iteration. Can you imagine that display??? \nIMO, iPad is already awesome, so you can't lose buying one now, if you can afford it. I found out the hard way that I couldn't afford it - my wife made me return it lol. \n\nA: GDGT says it's unlikely\n\n...given what's out there today, I think the technological leap required to make a 9.7-inch 2560 x 1920 display possible isn't right around the corner.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2075", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: Can I use an iPad effectively without a computer to dock it to? I'm interested in buying an iPad, but I'm trying to understand what the implications are of not synchronise/docking it with a computer. I only have Linux (Ubuntu) machines these days; I have nothing running Windows or MacOS. As far as I understand, there is no official support for Linux (I am aware of libimobiledevice, but would like not to rely on it).\nI'm used to my HTC Desire, which is able to synchronise most things I care about (IMAP, Google Mail, Google Calendar being three key ones) over the air, and I'd like to work this way with the iPad. When folks speak about the iPad, there seems to be a lot of talk of docking it with the computer, but I'm not clear why this would be needed/desirable. Can iPad apps typically sync over the air? I've seen reference to MobileMe, but that implies that this facility is not built in and may cost extra.\nWhat do I lose by not docking/syncing the iPad to a computer? Can I do that - buy it and use it indefinitely without docking it? Will I lose any major functionality?\nThanks.\n\nA: Andrew,\nThe iPad and iPhone can do all the important things you mention you can do with the HTC Desire (Gmail, Calendar, IMAP mail) in several ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*All email accounts (gmail, IMAP,\nexchange, POP) are all equal players\nin the Mail app, you just need to\nset them up and you can google the\ninstructions for how to do it\ndirectly on the phone.\n\n*Calendar is similar, with the\nexception of exchange accounts (they\nprovide both email and calendar in\none setup)\n\n*You can install and update apps\ndirectly on the app\n\n\nWhat you will miss if you don't connect to iTunes desktop application:\n\n\n*\n\n*Music and Video cannot be synced\nto the device for the iPod app.  If\nyou can live with purchasing iTunes Store music and videos (or youtube/last.fm/Pandora), then no biggie.\n\n*Photos sync using iTunes as well,\nbut you can also theoretically use\nthe camera sync tool to pull off\nyour camera (or card) directly into\nan iPad.\n\n*No backups of your device (I'd miss\nthis feature).  You can't do online\nbackups of your iOS profile, but\nonly with sync and only with iTunes.\n\n*No SW updates.  This will be\nnoticeable when iOS 4.x for the iPad\nis released, which gives\nmultitasking and folder management.\n\n\nI'd say, all in all, even without a desktop, the iPad is a useful device.  I got a while back and my parents have latched on to it, and they don't sync but it fills all their needs.  I sync it every week or so to do backups and OS updates as necessary (last month it hasn't seen iTunes at all, and it's doing fine)\n\nA: If you get a 3G iPad, I think the 3G data plan has to be activated through iTunes.  If you get Wi-Fi-only iPad, this isn't an issue.\nNote that you can probably get by if you have a friend with a Mac or PC who will let you sync once in a while for these rare needs.\nSyncing is also useful for these needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup\n\n*Transferring photos (although you can e-mail them instead)\n\n*Syncing calendar and contacts\n\n*Getting music, videos, and books from iTunes Music Store (you can d/l songs over the air, but I think the other media types have to be done through desktop)\n\n\nBut if you don't need those areas of functionality (and many people won't), then you won't miss syncing.  Basically, if you don't expect to use Apple's built-in apps, you won't need sync.\nMobileMe is really only useful if you have a Mac or PC.  It makes it easy to sync calendar and contacts across multiple machines over the air.  A few third-party apps use it as well, but not many.\nThird-party apps typically sync over the air, because Apple's sync is not very open to third-party developers.\nFWIW, since getting my iPad, the only time I turn on my MacBook is when I want to backup/sync purchases or charge my iPad.  I'm not saying that the iPad is a complete substitute for a laptop, but it is definitely a useful device all by itself.\n\nA: @torbengb\nI remember using Exchange facility on iPhone to integrate Google's calendar into iPhone's calendar, over the air.  Suppose this is not possible on the iPad?\n\nA: Since you're an Ubuntu user and already own an Android device, you may be better suited waiting for a good Android tablet.  I know there isn't anything out there right now that can compete with the iPad, but if you give it 6 months, there may be something that will fill your needs (read: wants).\n\nA: Have you considered running a virtual machine? I did that with my Zune for a while when I cut my nasty Windows habit. You could install Windows in VirtualBox and just use it to sync the iPad with iTunes or Wi-Fi Sync. . . depending on whether it's worth the hassle to you. This way you could still do your backups and get SW updates.\nAlso, from what I recall, there are ways to sync iDevices to Ubuntu. Rhythmbox and Amarok are ones I can think of off the top of my head.\nYou can also check out this article. Says 10.04 supports iDevices OOB (but you said you'd rather not depend on libimobiledevice) \n\nA: I find that Dropbox greatly increases my ability to rely solely on my iPad And iPhone for long periods without using my desktop or laptop. I can get source code, word or PowerPoint documents,and edit them all on my iPad. Then save them all back to Dropbox.  No need to use iTunes synch.  I cannot compile, but I can use LogMeIn to do so on a desktop when needed.  It is really nice not having to pop open a laptop and worry about its battery.  Of course, I don't have an Air.  But. The iPad is pretty powerful by itself.  \n\nA: You might have more success if you jailbreak it, in which case usage patterns Apple didn't think of (such as using it w/o iTunes, or wi-fi sync) become available.\n\nA: Of late, the way iOS has matured with the continual release of new iPhones and iPads, it is entirely possible (and quite common) to set up and use an iPad without docking it to a computer.\nIt started with the release of iOS 5 when iOS devices became PC free (iTunes/USB no longer needed to activate new devices via a computer). The iOS software update also started getting offered as OTA (over-the-air) updates.\nA majoring of casual users these days use an iPad as their primary computing device without owning a PC/Mac. 3rd party apps have evolved as well and there are apps available on the App Store for every conceivable need by almost every major vendor. That makes managing things like email and calendar a breeze. More and more website are now touch-screen/tablet compatible, and all major browsers are now available natively for iPad.\nFor information on setting up your iOS device without needing a PC/Mac, refer to the Apple Support article, Set up your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2092", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "18"}}
{"text": "Q: Is it possible to pre-install apps on an iPad? We're giving away iPads (for real, and no you can't have one) as part of a promotion to our referral network. But the plan is to ship it pre-installed with our sales presentation apps and sign-up tools.\nHowever, you can't install an app on an iPad until you've activated it through iTunes.\nIs there some method anyone's aware of that would mean we can pre-install these apps on the pad before giving it to the recipient to activate?\n\nA: Contact your local Apple Store and ask to speak to one of their Business Consultants (each store has one.)  If you are buying bulk quantities of iPods Apple used to offer digital etching of your company logo on the back as well as the ability to preload it with promotional content (e.g. videos), I am not sure if they are doing this with Apps on the iPad but it is worth a shot and the Business Consultant is the person who would know or have the resources to find out.\n\nA: When I picked up my iPhone 4 at the App store they were able to pre-activate it with the computer there so that I could start using it, but it still wasn't linked to a computer.  I was able to download some apps from the app store right away (linking it to my iTunes account).  Then when I got home I connected it to my computer and gave it a name and set everything up, completing the activation process.  It installed all the apps from my old iPod Touch onto the iPhone, keeping the new apps I installed.\nI asked the sales rep about it at the Apple store and he said it was a special configuration they had on their computers there.  So you might be able to do that with your iPads (although they didn't offer when I got my iPad) and then install your apps before sending them out.  \nOf course it would require you have an Apple store close by.\n\nA: I think, the only way to do this without hacking the iPads OS would be an OEM version of the iPad OS. I don't know if Apple offers something like that.\n\nA: It looks like you may have to look into the Enterprise Distribution solution.\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution/Introduction/Introduction.html\nAlso using the iPhone config utility.  I am not sure if it works with the iPad as well.\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/FA_iPhone_Configuration_Utility/Introduction/Introduction.html\n\nA: This is very doable. You could prepare one iPad the manner you prefer and store that backup image in iTunes.\nEach new iPad could be booted into restore mode (hold the home button while the iPad is off and connect it to the computer, holding the home button.)\nYou can then restore your image onto the iPad. Shut off the iPad, re-wrap it and optionally put your card in the box so the recipient is reminded you set it up personally for them.  You can easily be quite neat and do all this with the Aapple wrapping around the iPad itself nearly undisturbed except for the tab by the dock connector. It folds back well and the weight if the iPad soon makes it perfectly re-sealed. \nShrink wrapping the outside iPad box again gives the recipient that brand new feeling. \nThe licensing of your sales apps needs to be discussed so as to avoid the user from losing them on a restore without a backup. You have several options there from enterprise signing, volume purchase, custom app through apple or plain old gifting once the recipient sends your their Apple ID. But, the iPad will work out of the box and you have time to follow up with each recipient to keep them going.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2099", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "14"}}

It's been stable on my Windows XP HTPC and streams to my iPhone and iPad are great. It transcodes all kinds of formats on the fly. I've yet to see an encoding or format trip it up.\nOne feature I quite like about it is it'll transcode and store the stream to the media on my phone.

You'd just have to make sure all of the music and videos are imported into iTunes and that iTunes is running on the computer and the iPad and iTunes are using the same Apple ID.\nHere's Apple's \"Understanding Home Sharing\" page:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3819\n\nA: the best apps using smb protocol to play video audio and show photos pdf and downdload if you want or just stream\n\n\n*\n\n*remote files\n\n*remote files free (pro)\n\n*fileexplorer \n\n\nfor video audio player only \n\n\n*\n\n*aceplayer\n\n*oplayer\n\n*moliplayer hd\n\n\nA: I'm surprised to not see Plex mentioned yet.

{"text": "Q: How can I buy apps in the App Store without a credit card? While I'm waiting for my credit card to arrive, I still want to be able to buy some apps for my iPad!\nAre there alternative ways to pay for apps, without resorting to someone else's credit card?\n\nA: The iTunes store accepts Paypal, so if you can get money to Paypal you're all set.  I'm pretty sure Paypal has many ways to get money to them (mail them a check, give them your account number, etc.).\nThe trick seems to be that you have to sign up in iTunes on your Mac/PC -- the App Store on my iPod doesn't have Paypal as an option.\n\nA: I don't know if this is applicable to your country, but in Germany, Apple sells iTunes apps cards especially for buying apps in the app store.\n\nA: Many supermarkets and grocery stores sell pre-paid gift cards. You can purchase a Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc, gift card with cash, check, etc, at these supermarkets and then use the number on the front wherever they ask for a credit card number.\n(This method is actually a preferred method for the security-conscience as well. Reason: if someone gets ahold of your card number they can only take the small amount of money that you have loaded onto the card. This provides confidence for those worried about entering their card number online.)\n\nA: Get a 3V number, this is a virtual Credit Card that can be prepaid, so you dont need to worry about running up bills, but lets you do what a credit card does.\n\nA: Just to let you or some folks around to know. Again similar to the first answer in German AppleStore you can actually link your Apple Account with ClickandBuy where you can actually have transferred funds from your bank directly and if you also happened to have online banking with your bank (who doesn't?) you could top-up your ClickandBuy account almost instantaneously using a thing called Sofort\u00dcbervisung.

Is that possible? Is there some magic gesture I'm missing like three finger zoom scroll or two hand double finger split scroll?\n\nA: You can double-tap to zoom in to a section. I find this feature very useful. As you use it you'll soon learn where to double-tap to get the zoomed-in view you want.\nSafari does not have support for changing just the font size without zooming the page, but Opera Mini does have that feature. You can go to settings and choose from small, medium or large font sizes.\nBut note that this only works on some websites, not all. This is because changing font size can very likely break the website design/layout.

{"text": "Q: How do I record a screen cap video of the iPad? I'm looking for a method to record the video without actually filming the device. Does such a method exist?\n\nA: Reflection (US$15) turns a (Lion or above) Mac into an AirPlay receiver that can handle mirroring.  Once you've got the mirrored display on a Mac, all you need is to capture that video, which is easy.\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Reflection on the Mac.\n\n*Turn mirroring on (requires iPad 2 or newer or iPhone 4S or newer), selecting the Mac as the target.\n\n*Use a video screen capture program (Quicktime Player can do this, but there are lots of more advanced ones if you need more) to record the Reflection window.\n\n\nNo jailbreaking is required.\nAirServer (also US$15) is another application that offers essentially the same functionality as Reflection (and was released slightly afterwards), but is also available for Windows, if you don't have a Mac to do the recording on.\n\nA: If you are willing to jailbreak your iPad, both Display Recorder and ScreenRecorder do what you want.\n\nA: The easiest way to record an iOS screen digitally is to mirror the screen over AirPlay to a computer and record the screen of the computer. \nYou could also record the HDMI output from an AppleTV but that's usually more costly than picking up a license of Reflector.\nIt does recording for most situations, but I prefer using a second app in my Mac to record the screen and you have many more options there. \nThe simulator isn't an emulator - so you can't just run other apps in Xcode (with the assumption that the particular app you desire to record isn't one that you have the source code to run in simulation). I know you mentioned free trick for recording, but I've not found a free tool that works for decent quality.\n\nA: If you have an extra Windows PC with a spare PCI-express slot (and the Windows PC should be moderately fast, anything with multiple cores and a video card should do), then this is a VERY cheap method (should cost less than $150 all said and done).\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vho_GVXd5xs\nHopefully that's helpful for someone!\n\nA: Last month an app that does exactly that was banned from the App Store (read more here).

You can buy the Apple iPad Dock Connector to VGA Adapter, but it will only work with applications designed to support it.

{"text": "Q: Using an iPod charging cable to charge an iPad I lost the original plug-in charger that came with my iPad.  I have tried using my iPod cable to charge my iPad (plugged into the USB port of my Windows laptop) but the iPad will not charge (or at least it charges extremely slowly).  I also have tried using another USB plug adapter with the iPod cable (plugged into a wall outlet) and it also does not charge.  What is going on here and how can I charge my iPad now that I have lost the original cable and outlet adapter that it came with?\n\nA: The iPad uses a 10W charger.  The iPhone has a 5W charger.  Most older computers only support the original USB spec of 2.5W USB port power support.  Your iPad, when on, uses more than 2.5W, so it will not charge unless it's turned off, and when off it will charge at less than 1/4 the speed of the normal iPad charger.  That can be up to 16 hours for a fully depleted iPad.\nNewer Apple computers, and computers that support USB3.0, support higher USB power standards, but if your computer doesn't then you'll need to invest in a new charger for your iPad.\nNote that the iPad will generally charge off other USB chargers from other manufacturers, but only at a slower rate than the original iPad charger, unless the charger you use is specified to charge the iPad.  When the original iPad came out 10W USB chargers were not common.\n\nA: Because the iPad battery is so large, the iPad uses a more powerful charger to recharge its battery. The iPhone charger is 1 amp; the iPad charger is 2 amps. To get the extra juice, you need either a modern Apple computer (last 2 years) or an iPad specific USB charger.\n\nA: Looks like this is a known issue. I didn't find any news of Apple attempting to resolve the issue though. Might need to pickup a wall charger or something. I would also call Apple and bug them about this.\n\nA: I'm using the USB cord from my old iPod classic on my Windows PC, and my iPad charges just fine.

{"text": "Q: Is there a way to downgrade a 2nd gen iPod touch from iOS 4 back to 3.1.3? Is there a way to downgrade an iPod touch (2nd gen) from iOS 4 back to 3.1.3?\n\nA: There are two ways. \nThe first way was if you backed up your SHSH blobs with Cydia. (you would know if you did this) During a software update, iTunes verifies the software with an Apple server to make sure it's a valid, Apple-approved release. With major upgrades now 3.x, 4.x, Apple has stopped signing older versions, so if you try to restore normally to an older SW version, the verification process will fail. \nThe tutorial above will register your specific device on Cydia's server, then force iTunes to verify there instead of Apple's servers. Unfortunately, if you didn't back up before you upgraded, this will not work.\nThe other option requires some terminal work and downloading iRecovery, but it's not so bad. Here's a tutorial for it.\n\nA: On a second gen iPod Touch, just download the firmware (or find it if it is still on your system, but iTunes has a habit of deleting it), put your device into DFU mode, and shift-click restore on iTunes.

I have an iPod touch and, sometimes, I forget where I leave it, only knowing it's on my house.\nIf it was my cell, I would dial the number and listen. Is there a similar app for iPods?\n\nA: Your question and Webs' answer answer the question. With me.com, you can send an instant message to your iPod touch. Surely it needs WiFi turned on to receive the message. Additionally you can make the iPod beep for 120 seconds, and you can lock or reset it from remote.\n\nA: My guess is that most locating apps work using location services. Location services works by either triangulating the cell phone over cell connection or GPS. The iPod does not have a GPS or cell radio in it.\nI have heard of location services using WiFi location, but then you would need location services installed and my guess is that it is not installed on the iPod. However, if it is, then you could connect to WiFi, turn on location, download an app to find your device, and then find it over WiFi. But accuracy is going to be hindered greatly using location over WiFi. Not to mention you would have to have the WiFi radio on to even find the device in this scenario. Which is impractical and not a good idea for good battery life.\nAnother option would be an app that when activated turns on the speaker of the iPod and beacons. But you would need a way to remotely turn this feature on. The only options here are Bluetooth and WiFi. Again the idea is hindered by needing one of those two radios always on. Which is impractical.\nProbably the best options is one of those key finders. Key Ringer (http://www.keyringer.com/) is one such company. But the downside is you will need one of those bulky devices always attached to the iPod.\n\nA: MobileMe does this for iPod touches (if you have a paid account).

{"text": "Q: Is there a battery conditioner for an iPod touch? My iPod Touch's battery is not performming as well as it should.  I've had it for a while.  Is there such thing as a battery conditioner that might help get the battery performance better?\n\nA: Probably it's just getting old. Rechargable batteries wear out over time. About the best you can do is run the battery all the way down to 0%, such that it wont even turn on, and then charge it all the way back up to 100%, without unplugging it, leave it connected to the charger for several hours even after it's back to 100%. Repeat this a couple times, and see if it helps (no promises though).\n\nA: Although this doesn't really answer your question so much, I thought I would add to what NJD said as it's important to understand where \"conditioning\" IS useful.\nThe only consumer batteries that really benefit from \"conditioning\" are lead-acid batteries (think: car starter, marine/RV, and motor scooter batteries.) Putting a lead-acid battery thru a reconditioning cycle can \"de-sulfate\" the plates in the battery giving it back some of its lost capacity.\nNiMH and Li-Ion cells don't benefit from \"conditioning\". You'd just be putting your battery thru an extra deep discharge and charge cycle. \n(Although, as NJD pointed out, doing this with a Li-ion battery can sometimes give a more accurate indication of actual run-time due to the recalibration of the circuitry that accompanies the Li-ion battery. It still doesn't improve the battery itself.)\n\nA: The iPod Touch has a lithium-ion battery, which really does not need to be conditioned like the older battery technologies did.\nIn fact, completely discharging a lithium-ion battery too often can severely shorten its life, so I wouldn't recommend doing a full discharge too often. And I wouldn't recommend using something that goes outside the normal voltage range of the battery either.\nDischarging occasionally, perhaps once every 30 charges, can help to calibrate the battery so that it can given a better indication of run-time.\nApple recommends discharging completely about once a month.\nLithium-ion has a limited life-span anyway, typically 300-500 cycles; and they degrade over time too. How quickly they degrade depends on how hot they've been stored.\n(See Battery University for more information on this)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2192", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

{"text": "Q: Do I need a screen protector for my new touch-screen smartphone? With my old dumbphone I never really worried about the screen, but my new iPhone 4 has a pretty gorgeous screen that I certainly would never want to come to harm. So I was wondering how many people out there use a screen protector, and what your experience has been.\nSpecifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you use a screen protector for your smartphone?\n\n*Do they interfere with touch-sensitivity of a touch-screen?\n\n*Are all screen protectors created equal? Are there \"good\" ones and \"bad\" ones?\n\n*Are they more resistant to fingerprints than the glass?\n\n*Do they get grimey/dirty/cloudy?\n\n*Are they harder to clean than the glass, or do you just replace it?\n\n*How often would you need to replace it?\n\n*With glass on the back of my iPhone4, do I need one on the back as well? Or is that just stupid?\n\n\nI guess the most important question is: \n\n\n*\n\n*Do they really protect the screen in any meaningful way? Or do they just make you feel better?\n\n\nA: I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree with sebastiaan on almost all points, just to complete the spectrum :)\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, I've almost always had a screen protector on my smartphone.\n\n*Sometimes the screen protector interferes with the touch screen.  Depends on the quality of the touch screen, and the screen protector but in most cases you might notice a slight change in responsiveness.\nAre all screen protectors created equal? Are there \"good\" ones and \"bad\" ones? \n\n*Very yes.  Some are just clear stickers, others (like my favorites Invisible Shield) are the same material used to keep dust from messing up helicopter blades)\n\n*Sometimes.  This goes along with the quality of the screen protector.  But in most cases there will be less fingerprint smudging.\n\n*They can get dirty if they're low quality, or not applied carefully.  Usually lint or dirt will get its way into the edges and start to peel it off.  How well this works depends on the screen protector and the surface you apply it to.  But if you're just covering the screen you should be fine.\n\n*Usually just wiping it on my pants will get rid of most day to day dirt on it.  The big advantage is that if you get something stuck on it, you can scratch it off without worrying about your screen!\n\n*I had a full body protector on a blackberry tour for nearly a year before it started to peel off, and it really only started to come off on the curved surfaces.  I pulled off alot of the body protector, but left the screen protector on, and it's still going strong.\n\n*The invisible shield (I swear I don't work for them) can be bought as a full body kit, considering the shape and material of the iPhone4 I would say it's not stupid.  You want to protect the phone to keep it looking nice, then treat the front like the back, since they're essentially the same thing.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*No, I hate screenprotectors\n\n*Most of them really don't\n\n*There are certainly bad ones, that are hard to apply or peel off easily, I've even had one that would blur the screen\n\n*Only the ones that blur your screen ;-) They have a slightly matte finish so fingerprints won't be as obvious\n\n*Yes, yes, and yes.\n\n*I suggest you just replace them, they're not that expensive\n\n*I believe it is all stupid...\n\n\nThey just make you feel better. The glass on the new iPhone is incredibly difficult to scratch, and even the older ones hardly scratch at all. I suggest you stop caring so much about a little scratch, the device is supposed to be used. You'll hardly notice it if there even ARE tiny scratches. \nIf you want to protect it, what you really need to worry about is the thing breaking after you drop it, try a protective case instead. :-)\n\nA: I did not use one for my iPhone as the screen is glass and hard to scratch. \nI am using one for my Nexus One because the screen is plastic and probably easy to scratch.  Since putting the screen protector on I have stopped using the case.  I am using the Invisible Shield that Alex likes.\n\nA: I would have said no, you don't need a screen protector on your phone.  I've never used one on the iPhone, Palm Treo, Nintendo DS, etc.\nThen my wife dropped her iPhone and the screen cracked.  We're going to get her a screen protector now, so she can keep using the phone without worrying about it scratching her.\n\nA: I see that you have marked as an accepted answer. However, there is another proof that screen protectors these days have more essentials than Corning Gorilla Glass that protects well from scratches. As I took some few research, I found some useful benefits why people prefer screen protectors in the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prevents heavy scratches\n\n*Easier to clean fingerprints\n\n*Can resist screen breakage from an impact\n\n\nNot all the times that glass technology always invulnerable to scratches. When it say \"scratch resistant\" it means no scratches in a certain number of times. Also, like other usual glasses do, it breaks like fragile glass when it falls. You may check the Upgrade Your Life blog post about useful truth about screen protectors, including some video and descriptions and find out what I really mean.\n\nA: The Glass is pretty scratch resistant.   Yes they do protect the screen a bit.   I like my device to be like they designed it.   So do not want to add layers and bult to screen.   My one compromise is that I always use a \"bumper\" cover.   the glass on Iphone front and back is tough, but eventually in a two year that you normally use a phone you will eventually drop it. Cracked glass normally goes with a otherwise functioning device, but it is definately not nice.\nI have also found that some covers which are supposed to protect the phone, eventually gets some dust between the cover and device.   Do that and the device will look worse than the unprotected oen in the end.\nIf you are very disciplined and careful... go naked\nIf you like me tend to be clumsy (over a two year period) ... get some edge protection.\n\nA: If you get a nice warm feeling from knowing that your phone is mint underneath that scratched scratch-protection then get a cover and/or screen protector. Otherwise don't bother.\nI used a Zagg InvisibleShield on my iPhone 3G from the beginning. Result: The phone is scratchless but the shield needs regular replacement. This might be useful if I'd ever sell the phone, but when passing the phone down in the family, it doesn't add value.\nException: old devices with delicate plastic touchscreens: it's a good idea to use a screen protector here simply because the stylus will scratch the plastic screen. Here, it's a good idea to replace the screen protector every year or so. But today's devices have much tougher screens, and who owns and uses a device for more than two years anyway? (I do, personally, but most people replace their stuff too often to care about short-term wear.)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2246", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "14"}}
{"text": "Q: What is the best method to apply a screen protector to a touchscreen? Installing a screen protector on a touchscreen is not always easy.  Bubbles and dust can make your screen look horrible.  What is the best method/procedure you have found to apply a screen protector?\n\nA: First I make sure the screen is completely clean using a micro-fiber cloth, then I use a credit card with the cloth wrapped around to press the screen protector tightly as soon as it touches the screen.\nThe trick is to press, making a forward/backward movement, the protector against the screen as soon as it touches it, removing any bubbles in the process. So don't try to put the protector all at once.\n\nA: I live in a dry climate, so preventing dust from settling on the screen during application is one of the biggest concerns.  Another is in getting it aligned just right.  Here are some additional steps have used to get the absolute best results.  \nNote: this involves using water and electronics together, so you must be very careful to use the absolute minimum amount of water and the absolute maximum amount of care.  It could void your warranty, ruin your device, and/or inflict serious personal injury.  Perform at your own risk!\nSupplies\n\n\n*\n\n*Unopened screen protector\n\n*A shower or bathroom you can steam up (dry/dusty climates)\n\n*Microfiber cloth (I like the 3M Microfiber dusting cloth I picked up at the Grocery store)\n\n*Canned air (just in case)\n\n*Fine mist water sprayer (the InvisiShield screen protectors from Zagg come with a great sprayer filled with what I can only guess is distilled water)\n\n*Small squeegee or something like it (credit card, etc.)\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n*\n\n*Steam up your bathroom or shower by running very hot water in your shower.  This will help ensure airborne dust is minimized\n\n*Wash your hands throughly to remove oils from your fingerprints.\n\n*After you shut off the water, bring your supplies in.\n\n*Clean the screen using the microfiber cloth.  Inspect it carefully.  Use the canned air if necessary.  No dust should be visible at all.\n\n*Peel off the backing of your screen protector (don't touch the back, handle only with the sites)\n\n*Spray a very fine mist of water to the sticky side of the screen protector.  This will make it easier to align your screen protector precisely.\n\n*Position the screen protector at one end, using the squeegee lightly as you go to push out bubbles.  The water will form a thin film that makes it much easier to push out bubbles to the edge.\n\n*Once everything is in place and you have inspected for dust, use the squeegee and the microfiber cloth to push out bubbles and the thin water film to the edges.  Use the microfiber cloth to absorb water as it squirts out from under the protector, especially around buttons, case edgings, seams, and and other openings.\n\n*Sometimes, a small bit of water is trapped under the screen protector, but in my experience it goes away after a couple of days in a dry climate.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2250", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}
{"text": "Q: Is it my imagination or do iPods charge faster using a car charger? Maybe I'm crazy, but it sure seems like when I plug my electronics (iPhone, iPod, etc.) into a car charger it gets up to a full charge MUCH faster than if I use a regular charger and an outlet. \nDo these devices charge faster from car adapters, or am I imagining this? If so, why?\n\nA: The answer to this question is that \"it depends\" and it is actually quite possible that your car charger is charging your devices faster than the AC charger you use at home. In both cases, there is significant power available at the source to do the charging relative to the number of watts being used to charge the device. That is, both the AC wall outlet and the cigarette lighter socket are both going to have \"hundreds\" of WATTS available if not more whereas the device being charged is only going to be consuming maybe \"tens\" of WATTs at the most during peak charging rates.\nTherefore what makes the difference is the amount of power being OUTPUT by the particular charger itself....you just need to check the ratings of the charger and see how much power than can each OUTPUT. The output power is simply VOLTS times AMPS for the DC power that your device is likely to be using.\nSome wall chargers that are very inexpensive have very small power supplies in them and only put out a limited amount of charging current at the rated charging voltage for your device. Others may be quite a bit beefier and will be output up to or above the maximum the device will take. Similarly for the car adapter.\nGiven that the DC source from the car is directly available and a very low cost regulator can be used to generate a regulated charging voltage without having to convert using a switching power supply from an AC line, it seems more than likely that you have a car charger that charges quicker than your home unit. Also, it is possible that the device accepts a variable input DC voltage and can take the 9V to 12V range from the car directly. In this case, it is quite possible that the car charger will end up delivering significantly more charging power than the AC charger.\n\nA: The amount of power you draw from cars is quite limited, so it must be your imagination. The reason is probably because you are doing something instead of going back and forth checking. So it's more your sense of time that's different.\nA more detailed explanation:\nTypically what you get from a car at it's raw state, is something like 9-12 volts. What you get from your house is around 200-300 Volts, it depends where in the world you live. When you're changing a small gizmo, like iphone/ipad, that has a small power usage, 9-12 volts is just fine. However if you were to charge a laptop you would see what I mean. You would have to convert the 9-12 volts to 200-300, (a factor of 20-30) and would thus have to decrease the amperage with the same factor. The result would be that your laptop could hold power for a longer period of time, but would eventually go flat.\nSo there is a limit to how much power (Walt) you can draw from a car, and it will always be a lot lower than what you can get at home. If you are a skilled electrician you could raise the amount of power by accessing the car battery directly.\nNow why isn't it a lot faster to charge your iphone at home?\nWell it easily could be, but charging a battery at a very high pace, will also create a lot of heat. Apple have probably taken this into consideration when they created the charger for the iPhone. A balance between having a low charge time, without heating the battery too much which could risk the health or just the durability of the phone.\n\nA: I'll disclaim this post by stating upfront I am no sort of electrical engineer, but two things stick out to me as possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Phones operate on DC power. Any charging effort has to ensure the power is being delivered in DC form. This means charging from the AC outlet has to do a conversion, where as the power from the outlet on your car only has to be regulated. Which brings me to my second point..\n\n*The power from your car is already in DC form. If regulated correctly, it should be no different from the wall charger. If you're seeing drastically different charging times I would suspect either the wall charger is limited to prevent too much heat buildup, or your car charger is allowing more direct charging to occur (maybe at the expense of your battery?)\nMaybe batteries are 40VDC in Denmark, but they are (mostly) 12VDC in the US (which seems to be where the OP is from). Any car should have more than enough power to charge a phone. My Blackberry charger is only 5V 700mA. My truck has 12v with 30amp circuits... if not regulated I would probably have a fireball on my hands in a matter of seconds.  ;)\nJust something to consider...\n\nA: My iPhone charges twice as fast when being charged with a 3rd party after market charger in the car (DC), as opposed to the Apple AC charger.\nIn my case DC is definitely faster\n\nA: My experience is the car charger I use restores my iPhone battery at a FAR GREATER speed than does any device at home: my USB charger in the wall, my USB charger at my computers, and my iHome and other stereo docks.  It's not even close\u2014maybe as much as 4 or 5 times fewer minutes to full recharge. \n\nA: Ok... I'm going to put this in simple terms... most car chargers, especially the cheaper ones, don't have voltage regulators on them.  This WILL cause them to charge your phone faster. Some CHEAPER chargers don't have them either and will do the same.  HOWEVER, you should know home chargers are designed to be slower and \"trickle charge\" your battery because this is safer.  Speed charging damages the battery in time and will limit your battery's charge capacity even though it will read full.  If you look on your home charger it will state this.  \nFor example:  my home charger says on it,\ninput 100-240v\nOutput 5.1v\nWhy would my BRAND NAME MOTORLA CHARGER want to lower the voltage output?   Because it prolongs battery life.  This link has a little more tech talk in it on the subject... slightly.  http://chris.pirillo.com/are-mobile-car-chargers-good-for-phone-batteries/\n\nA: I think it's because we're charging straight from USB and there's no Adapter involved. May not be how we're intended to charge...\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2253", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: Does anyone have experience with buying an officially unlocked iPhone 4 in the US? Does anyone has experience buying an iPhone 4 to be unlocked (oficially by Apple) in the US?\niPhones are unlocked by Apple, after you request the unlock to your carrier (once you have paid the subsidy). Since Apple Stores allow buying iPhones at full price now (for gifts, for example), can I buy an iPhone in an Apple Store and immediately after call AT&T to unlock it?\nThis should be both legal and possible. Heck, even Apple could offer it in their stores. Does anyone have experience with this? Any tips on how to ask for the unlock to AT&T?\n\nA: No, this isn't possible to do through official channels. The officially unlocked phones are unlocked from the manufacturer; this isn't possible to do after the phone has been provisioned (otherwise the iPhone hacking community would be all over this avenue rather than going after security holes in the baseband to achieve the same effect). Because if their agreement with AT&T, Apple does not sell these units in the US, and every distributor outside of the US has to agree not to sell the units to US customers. \n\nA: Given what Adam said, your best bet to get an officially unlocked iPhone is (probably) through another country. I don't know about the Western hemisphere countries, but in Europe unlocked iPhones can be purchased in UK, France, Italy, and in several other countries. (In some places only through the Apple online store, in others also through brick-and-mortar Apple or non-Apple stores.) \nOne quite simple way would be this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Get an UK \"address\" from Borderlinx \n\n*Order the phone from Apple Store UK to that address (pay normally with your credit card). Note the FAQ which beautifully explains that it's SIM-free.\n\n*When Borderlinx gets the shipment they charge you for delivery (don't know about US but to Finland it's about $40) and when you've paid, they ship it to you (with UPS or DHL or similar service).\n\n\nUK is a bit far from you, so consider checking some nearby countries first for similar services. (Or if you have friends/relatives in some country with unlocked iPhones that's of course even better.)\n(UK + Borderlinx is a really popular method right now for getting an unlocked iPhone 4 where I live (as testified by e.g. this 45-page forum thread at local Apple fanboy site). Lots of people hate the SIM-locked & expensive Sonera deals we have.)\n\nA: I live in US and have been an AT&T customer for many years and requested that they unlock my iPhone4 as I travel and they refused. So when iPhone4S arrived, I purchased an unlocked phone directly from Apple. It costs a bit more BUT the benefits are astounding. I travel around the globe and have purchased micro sims in Singapore (Singtel), Dubai (du) and Europe (Ortel)and the 3G plans are excellent and what is really irritating is that the data plans are very cheap compared to US. Does an unlocked phone work, yes.. can you buy them .. yes.\nHOWEVER, if you are looking for a \"jailbroken\" unlocked phone, thats a different story. But if your need is similar to mine, Apple's unlocked phone is the way to go.

I have an iPod Touch -- my first iOS device -- and I'm trying to figure out how to set up the keyboard layouts, because I'm going to be typing almost exclusively Japanese.\nI went into the preferences, added the Japanese 10-key, added the Chinese (traditional) handwriting recognition, and removed all the others.  (I'm indifferent to the emoji keyboard layout, since it doesn't ever seem to appear, even when it's in the list.)\nAfter a few minutes of using my iPod, the keyboard settings will have automatically changed.  The Japanese romaji keyboard will have been added, and the Chinese handwriting will have been replaced with the English keyboard.\nI find this confusing and frustrating.  If I add these extra keyboards myself, then it doesn't muck up my preferences, but then I have a bunch of extra keyboards I'll never use, including the default keyboard.\nI've been trying for a couple days to find a pattern (a particular app or operation that causes the keyboards to spontaneously change), but I've not found a smoking gun yet.  One symptom is that when the keyboards change, when I go into the preferences, it's back at the top of the main screen, instead of wherever I was last (regardless of whether I was in the keyboard settings or not) -- but I don't know the significance of that.\nSo a few questions about this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this new in iOS 4 or 4.1?

Thus, when connecting to another PC (e.g. just to charge, or grab a photo), I have to wait whilst iTunes starts up and the device does some strange mini-sync (that doesn't seem to actually do anything other than lose track marks, scrobbles etc.). Have I got something set wrong?\nBoth the main machine used for syncing and the second machine this is most often a problem on are Windows machines. However, I have also seen it happen on a Macbook Air.\nThe situation which I envisage is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer A is synced to iPhone A\n\n*Computer B is synced to iPhone B\n\n*User A wants to be able to plug in to computer A, triggering an automatic backup and sync\n\n*User B wants to be able to plug in to computer B, triggering an automatic backup and sync\n\n*However, User A wants to be able to plug in to Computer B (e.g. to charge, to look at photos) without starting iTunes starting or performing any kind of sync whatsoever.\n\n*Likewise for User B on Computer B (or Computer C,D...)\n\n\nA: iTunes/iPhone syncing is done on a \"per Mac\" basis. In iTunes Preferences, go to Devices, and check the box for \"Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically\". This will prevent iTunes from opening when a device is plugged in.\nUPDATE: There used to be in previous versions of iTunes, in the old \"Syncing\" Preferences, a way to disable automatic syncing and that prevented iTunes from even opening. But it seems they have changed the behavior because searching for answers on other sites yield the same behavior but in previous versions of iTunes. I set this preference ages ago, so the preference must be holding over.\nIn response to your comments:\n\niTunes still starts, still does some\n  kind of mini-sync, but doesn't\n  recognise the name of the phone or\n  allow access to its contents.\n\nAre you sure you are syncing with the iTunes install you originally started with? Syncing is strictly a one-to-one relationship for iPhones and iTunes. Once you sync an iPhone to an iTunes install and wish to sync with a different one (like on another Mac), you are then forced to clear the phone and start anew. \nMy iTunes behaves the way you are describing, but when I plug in my iPhone, I get the \"mini-sync\" you mention because that's the device registering with the OS and iTunes that it exists and iTunes puling needed info to interact with it. Can't really get around that one.\n\nit would prevent the machine being\n  used at all for syncing, no?\n\nNo. You could still sync if you wanted, but that's if you are syncing with the iTunes install that recognizes the phone. Otherwise, see my comment above.\nBTW, save the downvoting for the really egregious answers. Downvoting costs points. Otherwise, just leave it alone.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2307", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}
{"text": "Q: What kinds of things should I do to maintain the performance of my iMac? I've recently switched from PC to Mac. So far, so good!\nWith my PC, I had a variety of tasks I'd regularly perform to keep my PC running well:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run CCleaner to clean up all the cruft (temporary files, hidden caches, etc.) that browsers leave behind\n\n*Run CCleaner to clean the registry\n\n*Run AdAware to clean up tracking cookies, etc.\n\n*Run MalwareBytes malicious software removal tool\n\n*Run Microsoft's malicious software removal tool to backstop malwarebytes (hoping that at least one of them would find the hard-to-catch stuff)\n\n*Run MacAfee's virus scanner (This software never did anything but give me headaches. But it's popularity made me uncomfortable just deleting it)\n\n*Run a disk defragmenter\n\n\nThere's probably a few more I'm forgetting too.\nObviously, PCs are high-maintenance. Maybe my list was overkill - I tend to do that, but since I use a computer to make a living, I want it to perform as well and reliably as it can.\nSo, now I use a new iMac. While I'm hoping the list is shorter than the PC list, is there anything I should do to keep it performing optimally?\n\nA: *\n\n*Set up Time Machine the first time you start you Mac,\n\n*Set up Software Update so that your system is always up to date.\n\n*A shutdown once in a while should clean most of little garbage but you will have to perform it anyway with some software updates.\n\n\nand\n\n\n*\n\n*Never log in with administrative privileges unless you have a serious reason to do so.\n\n\nA: Aside from the advice given by mouviciel, you\u2019ll need to perform certain tasks. The good news is: it can happen automatically.\nI suggest you get an utility either the free Onyx or the excellent (but Shareware) Cocktail. In a couple of minutes of experimenting with the options you can set that up to run automatically. \nMost of the cleaning tasks will be performed automatically. Of course, Time Machine and Software Updates are a good idea too. There are other utilities and you can probably find them with a simple Google query.\n\nA: I will try to hit your points one by one. Truthfully, I've been running OS X for almost 6 years and from my experience, I have not seen any degradation of performance over time. But for what it's worth, I am quite obsessive over the quality of my system, from performance to security, so this is an area I've actually researched and continue to have a thumb in. Even TRIM support for SSDs is a mixed bag.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run CCleaner to clean up all the crap (temporary files, hidden\ncaches, etc.) that browsers leave behind\nWhile having orphaned caches and preference files won't slow down your Mac, some don't like leaving cruft behind as it can take up valuable HD space. Apps like AppZapper and AppCleaner remove these files and may be something you wish to take a look at. Personally I use AppZapper.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run CCleaner to clean the registry\nMac OS X does not contain a registry. All preference files (which house your personal settings) are located in your users Library/Preferences folder. Letting them accumulate over time will not have a negative impact on your systems performance (see above).\n\n\n*\n\n*Run AdAware to clean up tracking cookies, etc.\nAgain, this will not adversely affect a system's performance, but you are certainly welcome to keep Safari free of garbage. Personally, I use Jar to achieve this. It is quite good, but unfortunately has not seen an update in quite a while. However, it is the cleanest and simplest app (there are others, but they require 3rd party plug-ins that may hurt your systems performance and stability) in this department.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run MalwareBytes malicious software removal tool\nUnnecessary on OS X. It has a native system to handle \"malware\" and while there has been only one documented case that has made it's way into the wild (with relative success), this still remains very much a non-issue on OS X. You can read more about the malware Mac Defender, and what Apple did about it. Malware remains a point of contention because it cannot be installed without some level of user interaction (unlike Windows).\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Microsoft's malicious software removal tool to backstop\nmalwarebytes (hoping that at least one of them would find the\nhard-to-catch stuff)\nAgain, not necessary. See above.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run MacAfee's virus scanner (This piece-of-crap software never did\nanything but give me headaches. But it's popularity made me\nuncomfortable just deleting it)\nYou'll be happy to discover that OS X does not contain viruses or requires any utility to protect it from such threats. Do not be bought into the FUD by those that would have you consume resources by installing anti-virus software for your Mac (yes, some exist). The most common argument is that it creates a protective barrier that may not be that useful on OS X, but will prevent the spread to machines running Windows. This is a non-starter because all Windows systems already contain anti-viruse software to protect them, ergo, they do not require an additional barrier.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run a disk defragmenter\nNot required. Apple has actually archived their document covering this topic as defragmentation and file optimization on OS X is no longer an issue. You can find it here. In a nutshell, it is not something a user should ever worry about. Disregard those that would have you install or copy your data to and fro in a vain attempt to \"optimize\" your files. OS X simply does not suffer from the problems that plague Windows in this department.\n\nA: No one's mentioned it but it's generally worthwhile making sure the space remaining on the primary OS drive is at least 10% of the drive space, this is mostly so the OS has room to work in. \nApparently (I've never sat and verified it) leaving items on your desktop will be viewed by the OS as an item to be loaded into memory, so try keep your desktop free (which is always a good thing anyway) to keep it running nice and clean.\nRemember to trash your cache files every 3 months or so.\nAfter a while go to Disk Utility and repair permissions, it's a bit of a waving a headless chicken over your computer but they can occasionally cause some issues.\nGo to the Spotlight settings and disable anything you're not interested in.\nAnd finally just plain old kill the Dashboard, unless you have some specific love for it.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2312", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: Does anyone have any tips or best practices for using NFS mounted directories? Does anyone have tips for conveniently dealing with a variety of NFS mounted directories in Mac OS X?\nWhen I drag them to the sidebar in finder they can't be renamed.\nWhen I mounted them using \"connect to server\" they get mounted under /Volumes.\nAlternatively I can access them using /net/host/export and they will get automatically mounted.\nBut there doesn't seem to be any way to visit a /net/host/export directory using the finder GUI.  Although it seems I can use \"open\" from the command line to visit it and then drag it to the side bar.\nSo anyway.   Any \"best practices\" out there?\n\nI seem to have a choice to drag either /net paths to the side bar or to drag /Volume paths to the side bar.  The finder seems to implement the auto-mount functionality when I click on /Volume-based sidebar links.\nI could also create symlinks to /net paths and use those symlinks.\nOne of the core problems I have is that the /net paths (and the /Volume paths) are long and unfriendly.  I'm looking for a way to \"manage\" these in a way that lets me use shortcuts or aliases of some kind.\n\nI'm still collecting tips.  When I get more, I'll come back here and rewrite this.\nBasically /net paths are treated by the finder as local directories.  In some ways it treats them as local (must use 'Goto' to open them) and in some ways it knows they are special (they don't show up in the \"Mac HD\" location).\nIf you have any other tips, please add them.\n\nA: In Finder press: \n\n\n*\n\n*\u21e7+\u2318+G to go to a directory. Since the automounting of /net is handled by the operating system (via Autofs, see the technical white paper) it will mount the share.\n\n*\u2318+K to open the Connections window, where you can even save your commonly accessed locations.\n(see the Go menu)\nBut I don't think you can rename connections.\n\nA: You can mount any NFS share using the fstab file (http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html). I found it to be the best alternative for mounting share so they appear in the top level of Finder (and also available in the sidebar), a feat impossible using autofs. Most importantly, it gives you the ability to add mount options like nolocks and rsize/wsize, which usually increase performance. YMMV.\n\nA: Here is what I did with all network shares I use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mounted all of them using Finder Go menu item \"Connect to Server\".\n\n*Set checkbox \"Connected servers\" under Finder's Preferences General\ntab. That makes all that shares appear on my Desktop.\n\n*Created a folder \"Network\" inside my user folder (on the same level\nas Documents, Movies, etc.\n\n*Dragged all of the network shares from my Desktop inside that\nfolder.\n\n*Dragged that \"Network\" folder on Finders Sidebar and also dragged it\ninto my Dock.\n\n\nNow I have easy and quick access to all my network shares and they mount automatically. And I also renamed them to my taste to better reflect what they are about. Is that the thing you want to accomplish ?\nTips:\n\n\n*\n\n*One can have several such \"Network\" folders like Home and Work.\n\n*One can create and put there Screen sharing and Remote Desktop\nshortcuts as well.\n\n*One can change their default \"remote volume\" icons to better\ndifferentiate them.\n\n*One can create new network aliases by dragging items from \"Remote Volumes\" section (Finder>Go>Computer.)\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2323", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

I've heard people talking about using alternative software to manage their iPods.\nMy iPod came in the post today and I was wondering what the pros and cons of using iTunes (as opposed to popular alternative) were.\n\nA: Pros: All works. Easy to use. Easy to Configure. Does Backups of your data. Allows iTS purchases. Handles everything for you.

{"text": "Q: Note taking for school I'm considering getting a Macbook or a Macbook Pro (I use Windows on my desktop computer), and I'm thinking about how note taking could be done.\nMost I'm thinking would use Microsoft Word/Pages, but OneNote seems to be loved a lot of people, especially for education purposes, and it's mandatory for use for people in Years 9 and 10 in my school thanks to the NSW Digital Education Revolution.\nBut OneNote isn't in Office 2008, nor is it in Office 2011. So what I'm asking is that if I take the plunge, will there be any alternatives, apart from the obvious of virtualisation, Wine or CrossOver? I'm fine with using Wine/CrossOver, it's just that I would be expecting a native experience to be better.\nAccording to a friend of mine, Word has a notebook feature, although I can't find anything about it through Google.\n\nA: Check out Evernote. There are Windows, Mac, iPhone, and web versions, and all your notes are synchronized to all your devices. You can even take pictures, include them in notes, and then search any text that was in the pictures.\n\nA: Yes, Word 2008/Mac has a notebook view, which I think would work fine for you. The #1 thing I like about it is that it can record audio simultaneously with your note-taking, so you can go back and listen to just that snippet of whatever the professor said, based on the notes you took that moment.\nWord 2011/Mac is coming out next month, btw, and I don't know for sure what will/won't be included/changed/updated.\nIf you need to synchronize documents among multiple machines, I highly recommend Dropbox.\n\nA: It's not OneNote, but all my Mac friends seem to use OmniOutliner.  If native experience is important to you, OmniOutliner is hard to beat.\nAlso, depending on what Mac you buy and when, Apple sometimes includes one or more of Omni's programs for free.\n\nA: Without turning this into a \u201clet\u2019s list all the applications we can\u201d, I\u2019d venture and recommend you a couple of note taking applications with a radically different approach:\nVoodoo Pad (and it\u2019s Lite counterpart) have a very interesting concept of how your notes end up being some sort of \u201cwiki\u201d where certain words link to other \u2018pages\u2019 of your notes. It\u2019s a very popular Mac application and even the Lite (free) version can be all you want. I suggest you take a look at its list of features.\nA different approach is given by an application like Notebook, which also offers an interesting concept that mimics a \u201creal\u201d notebook but with the advantages of a Computer interface. \nFinally there are two applications I like to keep around at all times for fast note taking that are \u201cplain text\u201d but insanely fast to launch/use:\nOne is Hog Bay Software\u2019s TaskPaper and the other is Notational Velocity. Extremely simple but more efficient than a bunch of \u201cTextEdit\u201d files spread across the drive. \nAs already suggested, using Dropbox is always a good idea.\nIt has already been suggested but Evernote is a nice application (which I really never use), but has a lot of fans because of its features.\n\nA: I use Pear Note on a daily basses to record all my lectures, it makes it easy to check though your notes and see what the tutor sad for each part. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2343", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I change the title of a boot image? I have an external Hard Drive with two bootable partitions on it. The first is an image of a Mac OS X 10.6 Install DVD, and the second is an image of a Mac OS X 10.6.3 Install DVD.\nWhen I plug the hard drive into a Mac Mini, and turn it on holding down the Alt key, I get the option to select which boot device to use. However both my bootable images are named \"Mac OS X Install DVD\".\nHow would I change the name of the bootable image?\nI have already tried changing the partition names but this has no effect.\nAny ideas?\nNote: I originally asked this on SuperUser, but upon discovering this site, I asked it here also.\nEdit: Here are some related pictures:\n\nThe Partition in Finder\n\nDisk Information in Disk Utility\n\nVolume Information in Disk Utility\n\nA: Note that since a firmware update that came in with High Sierra (late 2017) the root of the drive is now a secondary source for the disk label files. The primary source is within a directory called:\n.IABootFiles\n\nFor example, to hit both sources:\nsudo bless --folder \"/Volumes/Install macOS 10.12\" --label \"Install macOS 10.12\"\n\nsudo bless --folder \"/Volumes/Install macOS 10.12/.IABootFiles\" --label \"Install macOS 10.12\"\n\n\nA: Unless I'm totally misunderstanding your question, this is pretty simple.  You can change the volume name just by right clicking it in finder, choosing \"Get Info\", and modifying the \"name and extension\" field.  Or slow clicking twice on the name of the volume as it appears on the desktop, and editing it just like any other file name...  I do this all the time with bootable volumes and it works just fine.\nYour installer doesn't have to be called \"Mac OS X Install DVD\".  The installer doesn't care what you call it.  Name one \"Crap Bag\" and the other one \"Princess Consuela Banana Hammock\"... no one will care and OS X will still install just fine.\nedit:\nI just tried this with a USB stick I created that has the 10.6.3 installer on it.  I had already changed the name from \"Mac OS X Install DVD\" to \"10.6.3 Installer minus Optional\".  I just changed it to \"10.6.3 Banana Hammock\" and when I booted with alt, that is what was displayed.\nThere must be something not explained here that is causing this... maybe partition schemes other than GPT don't work this way?\non second edit:\nWhat method did you use to put the images on the bootable partitions?  I ask because I'm wondering if you just copied the images themselves rather than cloning or restoring them to the partitions.\nI've never tested this, but I'm wondering if it's possible to have .dmg files that are bootable on a partition.  The behavior that would arise would be in line with what you're describing.  You could change the partition/volume name, but it wouldn't affect the name of the dmg file.  Even if you changed the dmg file name, that wouldn't affect the name of the disk image (volume) contained within the dmg file.\nIf this is the case, I would think you could change the name by mounting the image in OS X, and then changing the volume name (the name of the volume that shows up on the desktop or in disk utility) that was mounted from the dmg or iso.\nedit III\nBelow are the steps I used to create my installer image.  The main difference is Carbon Copy Cloner.  It may not work any better, but at this point it may be worth a try since mine has the behavior you would like to see.\n\n*\n\n*Inserted OS X Install DVD.\n\n\n*In Disk Utility, clicked \"New Image\".\n\n\n*Named it \"Installer_image.dmg\".\n\n\n*Chose \"compressed\" and \"none\" for encryption, clicked save.\n\n\n*Once complete, I mounted the image and deleted the optional folder.\n\n\n*Right clicked the mounted volume, chose \"Get Info\", wrote down the exact amount of space used in the image for files and folders, and unchecked \"Ignore Ownership on this Volume\".\n\n\n*Went back to disk utility, inserted my flash drive, and made a partition named \"10.6.3 Install minus Optional\" that was about 500MB larger than the disk image's used space.\n\n\n*Did another \"get info\" on the new flash drive volume and unchecked the ignore ownership option.\n\n\n*In Carbon Copy Cloner: as source, chose the mounted installer volume, target was the new flash volume.  Chose \"Backup Everything\" and \"Delete items that don't exist on the source\". Clicked clone.\nAfterwards, I am able to change the name of the flash volume, and whatever I change it to is what shows up in the boot menu.\n\nA: This is an older post, but I came across it today and figured I'd share what I found.\nThe 'bless' command seems to make this work. First make sure the disk is mounted, find out which folder it is mounted to, and:\nsudo bless --folder <mount_path> -label <desired_label>\n\nFor example:\nsudo bless --folder \"/Volumes/Mac OS X Lion Install ESD\" -label \"Lion Install\"\n\nWhatever you put for the label is what should show up at the choose disk screen when holding option during a boot.\nNote that you'll probably want to do this in addition to renaming in Finder or Get Info just to keep them somewhat in sync and make them easier to identify in either case.\n\nA: Do you ever try use rEFit:\nrEFIt is a boot menu and maintenance toolkit for EFI-based machines\n\nA: Installer media\ndevguydavid's answer definitely leads in the right direction, but probably only works for older installer media.\nThe other David's answer likely works for contemporary installer media, but I haven't verified it.\nBut what about boot volumes for permanant operating systems or non-macOS installers?\nNon-installer boot volumes\nTo label any EFI boot volume, the bless command must be pointed to the folder containing the bootloader\u2014boot.efi or bootx64.efi\u2014in an EFI system partition (which may be the actual OS volume, or a separate volume dedicated to the task).\nThe exact location of the bootloader is ultimately arbitrary (i.e., one could move it around by changing settings in NVRAM), but it is typically one of a handful of locations, depending on the OS.\nLocate the relevant bootloader\nRun through the following conditions for the boot volume you want to change, then take note of the folder containing boot.efi or bootx64.efi.\n\n*\n\n*For standard installations of macOS:\n\n*\n\n*With an HFS+ startup volume format:\n\n*\n\n*boot.efi is in /System/Library/CoreServices on the startup volume.\n\n\n\n*With an APFS startup volume format (generally macOS 10.13 or later when the boot volume is stored on an SSD):\n\n*\n\n*The bootloader is stored on the Preboot APFS volume (in the same actual disk partition as the boot volume).\n\n*\n\n*To mount this volume, run diskutil list, look for Preboot next to the name of your startup volume (Macintosh HD or whatever) and then run sudo diskutil mount diskXsY, substituting X and Y to specify the Preboot volume.\n\n\n\n*boot.efi is in /Volumes/Preboot/<some-UUID>/System/Library/CoreServices\n\n*\n\n*where <some-UUID> is the longest filename shown by ls /Volumes/Preboot.\n\n\n\n\n\n*(Source: Booting the Mac: bless, and what makes a volume bootable from Eclectic Light Co.)\n\n\n\n*For Linux installations, installers or other live media:\n\n*\n\n*There is no definitive, uniform bootloader location for Linux OSs, but the following location is somewhat likely:\n\n*\n\n*In the EFI partition on the startup disk (the EFI system partition).\n\n*\n\n*Presumably (if you are running Linux on a Mac) you know how to mount this, but the gist is diskutil list followed by diskutil mount diskXsY, substituting X and Y to specify the EFI partition.\n\n\n\n*bootx64.efi or similar is in /Volumes/EFI/EFI/boot. (Note that this is technically a fallback location\u2014the actual firmware will likely be somewhere else, and you may have to do some poking around using bootoption as described below).\n\n\n\n*(For an extremely informative deep dive into the standard EFI boot process, I highly recommend UEFI boot: how does that actually work, then? from Adam Williamson)\n\n\n\n*For Windows:\n\n*\n\n*In the EFI partition on the disk where Windows was installed (mount it under macOS as you would for Linux):\n\n*\n\n*The EFI firmware (which Windows calls bootmgfw.efi) should be in /Volumes/EFI/EFI/Microsoft/Boot.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Anything and everything:\n\n*\n\n*If you still can't find your bootloader, I recommend using bootoption:\n\n*\n\n*Run bootoption list and find the identifier for the boot entry you want to label. It should be BootXXXX where X is 0\u20139.\n\n*Run bootoption info BootXXXX as appropriate. Look for a Partition UUID or a pair of Container Partition UUID and APFS Volume UUID. Also note the Loader Path.\n\n*Run through each volume printed by diskutil list with diskutil info diskXsY until you find a matching Disk / Partition UUID or Volume UUID.\n\n*\n\n*For APFS volumes, consult Container Partition UUID to find the actual disk partition. The volume (in the container partition) containing the bootloader has Volume UUID = APFS Volume UUID.\n\n*For all other volumes, look for a volume such that Partition UUID = Disk / Partition UUID.\n\n\n\n*Finally, the bootloader is located at Loader Path on the volume you just identified.\n\n*\n\n*e.g., \\<uuid>\\System\\Library\\CoreServices\\boot.efi, \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi, etc., etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the label\nOK! Knowling the location of the bootloader, we can now use bless to add or change its Boot Manager label:\nsudo bless --folder <bootloader-folder> --label '<new-label>'\n\nThis creates the files .disk_label and .disk_label_2x in the bootloader folder.\nThe reason this process is so complicated is that the labels are actually stored prerendered in an extremely simple image format. This obviates the need for font rendering in the preboot environment.\n\nA: Given that you can't change the name of the disk images, what you need to do is be able to tell which disk image is which. To what you're doing now, you'll need to add one extra step\u2026 \n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in the external HD.\n\n*Boot the mini from its internal HD.\n\n*Go to System Prefs > Startup Disk. Each bootable system listed should display its OS version. Choose the specific installer you want.\n\n*Click the \"Restart\u2026\" button.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2350", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "16"}}

{"text": "Q: How do I kill the \"server connections interrupted\" window/process? When my MacBook wakes up, away from a network it was previously connected to, it shows the \"server connections interrupted\" window. When I click \"disconnect all\", I get a spinning beach ball of death. Restarting the finder doesn't help. Logging out and restarting is not possible anymore. The only thing I can do is a hard reset.\nOr is there a way to kill the process from the terminal or from the activity monitor?\nStrange fact: when the interrupted connection window is beachballing, I'm also unable to invoke the 'About this mac...' command in the apple menu. Nothing happens...\n\n\n\n\nA: If the issue is not common enough to find a solution on the Apple Knowlegde Base then it is most probably a rare issue caused by a corruption in the operating system or a 3'rd party application. Under these circumstances I would recommend one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalling OS X (after performing a backup, preferably with Time Machine).\n\n*Find someone else with identical hardware and software to see if their laptop does the same thing under the same circumstances (might be a compatibility issue with your wireless access point or router?)\n\n*Make a reservation at the Apple Genius Bar, they are great troubleshooters and will be able to tell you if there is something wrong with your laptop hardware or software.\n\n*A lot of troubleshooting information can be written to the OS X Console. Just have it running (and visible) while replicating this issue and it might print some information related to the issue.\n\n\nI hope one of those steps can help you diagnose the issue, as it does not seem to be common enough to find a single solution for :-)\n\nUPDATE: Since it appears that you are running \"ADMitMac\" which probably integrates with OS X in a significant way, and considering your issues are network related, there is a rather large red flag surrounding this software. I would strongly recommend uninstalling it as a trial to diagnose the issues you are encountering.\n\nA: Good advice has already been given, however, in order to determine if there\u2019s a specific share causing the issue, I\u2019d suggest two things:\n1) Create a new blank user, connect from there and try to see if this new user exhibits the same problem/behavior. \n2) Additionally, disconnect all shares and start connecting one by one and perform the voodoo magic to reproduce the \u201cdisconnect\u201d dialog (with each individual connection). That way you could see if the problem only manifests in some connections but not others, or all.\nDo you have any server log or anything that could be an indication of a process hanging or waiting for a server response that never comes? (already suggested)\nUPDATE: Today I made a test. I connected my 10.6.4 to a Samba box running an ancient version of Fedora (probably 3-4 years old). And when I had the connection open, I halted the server to get the Server connections interrupted dialog:\nHere\u2019s how my dialog looked like: \n\npublic is the name of the share and nippur is the name of the server. \nNow that\u2019s why your dialog looked weird. Are you sure you\u2019re running 10.6.x?\nUPDATE 2: You\u2019re running 10.6.4 but using ADMitMac, which \"turns a Mac into a true Active Directory client\u201d. I suspect that\u2019s where the problem lies. I\u2019d disable or remove that and start from there. I\u2019m 99% sure that without it, the problem will go away. The problem will then turn onto a new question\u2026 why? But that\u2019s an entire new world and only Console Logs will help (plus, of course, ADMicMac\u2019s tech support). \n\nA: Try killing /System/Library/LoginPlugins/FSDisconnect.loginPlugin as described at http://whatsamknows.tumblr.com/post/37368603810/get-rid-of-server-connections-interrupted\n\nA: If you are running 10.2 or 10.0 then what you are describing appears to be covered by the Apple Knowledge Base Article TA21171 (Interruption of Server Connection Can Cause Computer to Stop Responding). The solution they outline in the article:\n\nTo resolve the issue, you may have to force restart your computer using the power or interrupt button.\nAvoid the issue in the future by ejecting any shared volumes before taking the actions described above.\nIf you accidentally trigger this issue, restoring connectivity to the server might eliminate the need for a forced restart.\n\n\nA: I haven't had problems with disconnected network drives, but I have seen myself the Finder error -10810 and have always just restarted my Mac (saving all work beforehand).\nThis thread here suggests though, that Finder will recover itself in a matter of few minutes so give that a try.\n\nA: I have exactly same problem. I get this aprox 75% of time when I wake my MacBook Pro from sleep. Everything works thou, so if I click share it's up and running. I guess my problem is related that network hasn't really woken up from sleep and therefore I get this annoying message dialog.\nSo my preferably solution would be that message box would be ignored. Does anyone know a way to do this? Or maybe shell script which would kill this message box..\nI'm running 10.6.4 and not running any third party Active Directory or Network software\n\n\n*\n\n*Kriz\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2354", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

I have attempted making my own profile but have difficulty matching them.\nIs there any better way to make my monitors match color wise? Do you have any tips?\nMy problem is that I am creating interfaces and the coloring appears to be 'off', between the two.\n\nA: There some hardward-based display calibrators that usually cost $80 and up. Some names are \"Datacolor Spyder3Express\",  \"LaCie Blue Eye\", \"PANTONE huey\".\nAn important issue with calibration for the web is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Calibrate with gamma 2.2. If you're on Snow Leopard, especially if you started with it on the Mac when you bought, then it will be gamma 2.2 already. But if you use Leopard or calibrated on it, you might have gamma 1.8, which is not standard for web (and doesn't fit Windows, which also has 2.2).\n\n*Learna about sRGB color profile, which was build for CRT monitors back in the day. Many browsers don't support embedded color profiles for images (Safari does support, though), which means they'll render uncalibrated, which means they'll be rendered in your (and other visitors') monitor' profile, which might be close to sRGB.\n\n*You should preferably export all your graphics without profile or with sRGB profile for them to display most propertly with all brosewrs.\n\n*Calibrating with Mac OS X build-in software calibrartion is possible but might require several iterations to get right. If your display has non-LED backlighting you should let it work for about 10 minutes before calibrarting or otherwise judge its colors, while the lamp warms up.\n\n*You're better off try to compare some images that have embeeded sRGB profile and the same that isn't  and see if the colors match in browser.\nResources:\n\n\n*\n\n*A good place to test your monitor (but not calibrate color profile) is: http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/\n\n*sRGB and other color profile information: Has great tests with hover-switching images to see how different profiles and no-profile images display on your monitor. http://www.gballard.net/psd/srgbforwww.html\n\n*The above website has specific instructions on calibrating a Mac: http://www.gballard.net/photoshop/hardware_calibrate_monitor.html\n\n*Calibration theory and some test images (even though more photography oriented): http://www.normankoren.com/makingfineprints1A.html\n\n*Some Mac OS calibration process tips at http://www.khulsey.com/monitor_calibration.html\nAlso, S-IPS panel monitors have more consistent color reproduction at different viewing andles. If you have regular TN monitors, you might have a problem see them both at the same color from the different angles that you see them, even if each one is calibrated 100% when viewed hean-on.\nAnd yes, it might take huge amount of time and a lot of disappointments, so be patient.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2365", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: Will a cloned hard drive function exactly as the original? If I buy a new hard drive and clone my original onto it (using Carbon Copy Cloner or something similar), will my computer function exactly the same as it did before? Will things like licensed programs not work properly? (I can't think of any reason they wouldn't, but you never know.)\n\nA: Short answer: Probably\nLong answer:\nTechnically speaking CCC and similiar tools do not make bitwise exact copies of volumes. There are detectable differences (for example, each disk will have different UUIDs). Having said that, I have never seen any software that depends on something like the disk UUID, but it is possible someone uses it as a part of a copy protection scheme or something.\nOne exception is Time Machine. Time Machine uses the UUID to identify the source disk. So in order for time machine to incrementally continue on your previous backup, you'll have to use the command sudo tmutil associatedisk -a.\n\nA: As has been said, everything should work.  It is easy to test this.  Simply put the drive in an external enclosure, clone the current drive, then use Startup Disk utility in System Preferences to boot off of the new disk.

{"text": "Q: Is there any way to set a MacBook Pro to not sleep when you close the lid? The most common use case I have for this is when I'm playing music over AirTunes, but don't want an open laptop laying around.   Or when I'm syncing or downloading something.\nThis isn't the same as this question, which related to sleep vs. hibernation; I'm looking for a way to make it stay active with the lid closed.\n\nA: The caffeinate command line utility (built in, at least in Mavericks and Yosemite) does just this. \"man caffeinate\" for more\n\nA: You can use InsomniaX. It sits in your menu bar, and upon activating it, your laptop won't sleep if you close it.\n\nA: I'd gladly comment on the question, but stackexchange \"rep\" policies do not allow me to comment. Therefore I drafted this \"answer\". Please bear with me! This answer aims to prevent you from going into the wrong direction.\nIf you open a terminal console and enter pmset -g pslog, you see what happens when you close the lid:\n\nmc-dondon:~ dondon$ pmset -g pslog\nLogging IORegisterForSystemPower sleep/wake messages\npmset is in logging mode now.

However, with respect to your question, pmset does not do the trick - at least not for me.\nNeither \"sudo pmset noidle\" nor the often suggested \"sudo pmset -a lidwake 0\" will prevent the system to go to sleep when the lid is closed.\n\nA: There's also the macosx-nosleep-extension alternative to insomniaX.\n\nA: Without using any third-party software, Apple says you need to have an external keyboard, mouse, or trackpad (USB or bluetooth) to prevent the computer from going to sleep (Lion), or to awaken it from sleep (Snow Leopard and earlier), after the lid is closed.\nIt turns out that you can apparently connect any external USB device to wake it back up from sleep. I do this with a MacBook Pro that I use with Synergy so that I can use the keyboard and mouse on my Linux workstation to control my MacBook Pro with an external monitor and the lid closed. I just plug in my USB flash drive after I close the lid to wake the MacBook Pro and then I can start using it in clamshell mode with no external keyboard or mouse connected to the MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Connect an external mouse or keyboard. Close the lid, then hit a key on the keyboard or click the mouse. This wakes the laptop from sleep even if the lid is closed. \n\nA: I use Nosleep on My macbook pro. It sits in your menu bar and then you can double click it and once it turns blue, the laptop stays active when you put the lid down with the screen and backlight turning off.\n\nA: This is a bit hacky but doesn't require any 3rd party software.\nOpening a screen sharing session will prevent the target Mac from sleeping, even when the lid is closed and it's running on battery power.  I'm referring to the built-in macOS screen sharing feature you can enable in Preferences -> Sharing.  Once enabled, just open the \"Screen Sharing\" app on another Mac, findable via Spotlight, to connect and force the other computer awake.\n\nAs long as the screen sharing session is open the target Mac won't sleep.  I can even use this trick to wake up a sleeping Mac, that's on battery with lid closed, assuming it's still listening on wifi in some lower power mode.\n\nA: This isn't a perfect solution IMO, but it's the closest I've found without installing a third party program.\nYou can completely disable sleep using sudo pmset disablesleep 1. However, after doing this you can't even manually issue the Sleep command from the Apple menu. Sleep mode becomes completely disabled.\nTo allow sleep once more, use sudo pmset disablesleep 0.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2389", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "72"}}

{"text": "Q: Are there headset adapters usable for MacBook Pros? I bought a headset, and it has a (obviously) male headphone input and microphone output. Problem is, MacBook Pros don't have a microphone input. Instead, they have an audio line in.\nHowever, relatively recent MacBook Pros apparently combine the audio out with a microphone input, allowing, for instance, iPhone headsets to be plugged in the computer and work as expected.\nSo I was wondering if there were adapters that took the two jacks and merged them into a single, \"iPhone-compatible\" jack, that I could plug in the MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Of course the combined jack on Macbook is analog, of course it accepts mic signals (works with apple and other brand headsets for iPhone, for example) and not just line in signals (you can even plug electric guitar with passive adaptor from iRig) and as Zneak properly points in his question, it would not be too difficult to make an adaptor that splits one headset jack on Macbooks into headphone and mic, which is also great if you want to use some top notch headset like Sennheiser PC 360. Unfortunately I was not able to find such a product, only a guide on how to make one.\nLast but not least, USB headsets are in no way better. They only use extra CPU power, clutter USB ports and are only as good as the DACs, ADCs, headphone and mic they employ. Now these components are much better inside Macbook and good analogue headset...\n\nThe Headset Buddy at Amazon claims to do just this. But I am not sure how well it will work, as the headset pinout Apple uses in Macbook, iPhone or iPad is different from some other manufacturers (that is why you cannot use iPhone headset with, say Samsung Galaxy S)\n\nA: Some two-plug headsets come with USB adapters, e.g., my current headphones (note the circled dongle).\nYou can also buy third-party USB adapters which should work (emphasis on the should), such as this USB 2.0 Virtual 7.1 Channel Sound Card Adapter.\nHowever, I don't know of any adapter with standard two-plug headset jack inputs and a single-plug headset output\u2014but I wish I did, as then it might also work for connecting standard two-plug headsets to iPhones and iPads.\n\nA: The problem lies in the fact the \u201cMic\u201d input in all the Macintosh line (Macbooks, iMacs, Mac Pro) is not a Mic input but a Line Input as it has been already stated.\nA Line input expects a much higher signal than a typical microphone, so the signal is barely if at al heard if you plug a mic directly into that.\nThen we have the impedance issue, the different impedance can be explained like\u2026 imagine a small water globe (the mic) hitting a brick wall (the line in). That\u2019s what the sound coming from the Mic experiences when it \u201chits\u201d the line in. It bounces back and nothing gets through. \nAs for your question, I am not aware of those, but you can get very cheap USB dongles that will let you connect both the headphones and the mic into a single USB. There are plenty, Creative Labs having one as far as I can remember. They are usually deprecated because most headphones for computing ARE USB directly, meaning they have the circuitry integrated.\n\nA: Yes.  As hinted by Kyle earlier, the \"Headset Buddy\" (about $15 from Amazon) works perfectly for this task.  Using it you can use your normal microphone (and optionally headphones) by plugging them into the combined \"headphone\" port on the MBP (not the \"audio in\" port).\nNote that on my MBP (Mid 2010) this functionality does not work under Windows XP or Windows 7.  If you need a headset microphone under Windows, I would recommend a USB-Mic adapter instead, such as the Griffin iMic.\n\nA: I have a USB -> female audio, that lets you plug either the male headphone jack or the male microphone jack into it, and then use the \"official\" female adapter on the laptop for the other. Would this help?\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2397", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "12"}}

While I hear the disk spin up my iMac is unresponsive.

{"text": "Q: Installing applications from disk images - what about the resources? I know that the way to install an application on Mac is to drag the icon from the disk image onto applications. Often these folders don't just contain an application but resources (such as a readme as well). How do I then access these resources later? Do I have to save the disk images as well? This seems kind of silly as then the default instructions for installing the application mean that you can't easily access the readme later (as the disk image has probably been saved to the downloads folder where it will eventually end up being deleted).\n\nA: What I do in these cases (which I seem to run into fairly often lately) is create a new folder in Applications, and then drag everything from the disk image into that folder. It's one extra level, but it works just fine for almost every application.\n\nA: As you have correctly guessed, those resources won\u2019t be available unless the application provided an installer and/or a folder (for example World of Warcraft is a big folder with lots of things in there). \nIf the application is just a bundle you have to drag (like most), if you want to access any resource in the disk image at a later time, you will have to save it.

If you move or hit the \u201czoom\u201d button, the OS X window manager will automatically resize the window to remove the part that is covered by the dock. \nA different behavior can be observed if the dock is set to \u201cAuto-Hide\u201d (cmd+alt+d). Since the Dock is now a \u201ctemporary visible\u201d object, windows will cover and use that part, regardless of the Dock\u2019s visibility at the time of the resize.\nUPDATE: If the Dock is always visible, are you telling me that you can\u2019t grab any window (in this example a Finder window) and drag it like in the picture? (The red arrow is the mouse pointer that the SSHOT didn\u2019t capture). I was clicking and dragging below the dock.\n\nUPDATE II: As we started investigating, turns out that the following is true: \nIf OS X has a secondary display attached and this display\u2019s vertical resolution is higher than the primary display (where the menubar and dock are), then the Dock will let you resize \u201cbehind\u201d it. I don\u2019t have enough screen combinations to test exactly when this happens, but it\u2019s clear to me that it only happens when there\u2019s an external display. \nNext is a shot of my arrangement. As you can see in the picture, the \u201cgap\u201d between the big wide screen and the vertical one on the right is what I think causes the Dock to behave like this. It appears as if the window manager takes the highest vertical size when determining the bounds. I don\u2019t know if this is a feature or a bug.\n\nUPDATE III*: Ok, for the sake of testing, I went ahead and modified my Screen\u2019s arrangement (see picture). I exaggerated the placement because I wanted to make sure that there\u2019s no weird offset acting. With the screens arranged like in the picture, my dock will not let me resize below it.\n\nThis possibly solves the \u201cmystery\u201d of why does this happen. I hope you can replicate it and/or find a way to work around the issue. For the record, I rarely run into this because I usually either auto hide the dock or use SizeUp to move/arrange my windows, and it doesn\u2019t let me put windows behind the dock.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2430", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "19"}}
{"text": "Q: Is it possible to redefine what Keynote interprets as bold and normal for a particular font? When working in Keynote I like to use medium and light fonts instead of bold and normal. This causes me a problem because when I hit apple-b to embolden something I want the font to be switched to medium instead of bold, but the default is the bold font.

{"text": "Q: Is there a cheaper alternative to cinema displays? Apple displays are great, except for the price.\nI'm looking to replace my LG 19\" display with a 24\".\nI can't find any screen that isn't overly widescreen, it's ridiculous ! Wide is good but too wide isn't useful, Apple 24\" displays have the screen estate I'm looking for.\nDell used to do nice 24\" (2408WFP) but they don't sell them anymore.\nIs there any display out there which shares the ratio of Apple's cinema displays but also cheaper ?\n\nA: How about Dell U2410. I use one at home and it is a great monitor.\n\nA: Samsung P2770HD\n27\" and a resolution of 1920x1080. However only 16bits per pixel, so color banding is very visible. I recently bought one cheap. Happy about the size. Not too happy about the colors. \nThe Cinema displays can go up to 2560x1440 and has 24bits per pixel, so this Samsung display can only compete on size and price.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"overly widescreen\" - are you looking at these screens in person or on the web? How can you tell they're overly wide?\nI'd be far more concerned with display quality than display sizing. The Dell screens I've used in the past have always been terrible at getting the color quality that a macbook pro screen has.\nI'm currently using a Samsung 2333HD next to my MBP and it's a serious competitor to the apple display quality, in my opinion. To be fair, it's just under your specs at 23\" but it's more than enough extra screen real estate for me and you'll surely be impressed if you're upgrading from a 19\".\nThe newest apple display is 19.35\"x25.7\"x8.15\" (and that's for a 27\" screen) whereas the 2333HD is 16.5\"x21.8\"x8.5\" (for 23\") so very close to the same depth and 3\"/4\" less height/width for 4\" less screen size. It's the same 16:9 aspect ratio, so you probably won't be disappointed by the width and, again, you definitely won't miss out on quality. Seems like it runs around $200 these days, I got mine for $150 on sale so you could probably search around a bit for a better price.\n\nA: DELL U2410 is a good choice and new U2412M which use LED as backlight cost less energy.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2441", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: What is jail breaking \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat are the benefits of iPhone jailbreak? \n\nWhat is jail breaking? Why do people do it? What is the advantage and disadvantage?\n\nA: IOS_jailbreaking\n\nJailbreaking is a process that allows iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch users to install homebrew applications on their devices by unlocking the operating system and allowing the user root access. Once jailbroken, iPhone users are able to download many extensions and themes previously unavailable through the App Store via unofficial installers such as Cydia, Rock Your Phone and Icy Installer. A jailbroken iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch is still able to use the App Store and iTunes.\n\nIt is mostly done to escape the restrictive nature of the App Store. Once you have jailbroken an iPhone you are free to install a lot of software that apple would not normally allow. Such as modifying the lock screen to display useful information, or enabling multitasking on an iPhone 3G.\n\nA: Jailbreaking is to break out of the \"jail\" that Apple runs normal software in so you can do unauthorised modifications such as install your own applications or alter system components. Jailbreaking is often done by exploiting security issues in iOS and such are closed with the next software update.\nIf you jailbreak your iOS device the device is unsupported. While it's not illegal Apple has explicitly stated it's entirely your problem for any issues you cause. (The Genius bars won't touch a jailbroken phone unless it's been restored and the problems exists on a non hacked version of iOS).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2450", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

At one place I get wireless internet (and thus I have to disable internet sharing), and at the other I get internet from an ethernet cable and set up the computer to share the internet to other devices by creating a small wireless network.\nBut it's getting a bit tedious having to go into System Preferences and start/stop the internet sharing every time I switch locations, so I would like to have a quick command or script to launch and do the switch on demand.\nAny hints or ideas?\n\nA: One way of doing this is by GUI scripting\u2014System Preferences doesn't have any Applescript support by default.\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to set current pane to pane \"com.apple.preferences.sharing\"\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    click checkbox 1 of row 8 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window \"Sharing\" -- change to row 10 if you are using anything before Snow Leopard\n    delay 1\n    if (exists sheet 1 of window \"Sharing\") then\n        click button \"Start\" of sheet 1 of window \"Sharing\"\n    end if\nend tell\nignoring application responses\n    tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\nend ignoring\n\n\nA: I had far better results (for an already configured sharing setup) on 10.11.6 with the simple variations...\nsudo launchctl start com.apple.NetworkSharing\nand\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.NetworkSharing\nrespectively.\n\nA: Definitive workaround to wifi-sharing constant breaking down in MacosX\nI have found a system that finally works and when, less frequently wifi sharing breaks, it manages to recover it automatically in a minute.\nThe solution is a ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.me.wifisharingup.plist daemon with the next contents:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>com.juanfal.wifisharingup</string>\n\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>/Users/mi/bin/wifisharingup.sh</string>\n  </array>\n  <key>Nice</key>\n  <integer>1</integer>\n\n  <key>StartInterval</key>\n  <integer>60</integer>\n\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n\n  <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n  <string>/Users/me/Library/Logs/wifisharingup.err</string>\n\n  <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n  <string>/Users/me/Library/Logs/wifisharingup.out</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nYou can see, each minute it runs the simple script that follows.  Be careful making the previous plist be owned by the root and launch it with:\nsudo chown root com.me.wifisharingup.plist\nsudo launchctl load /Users/me/Library/LaunchAgents/com.me.wifisharingup.plist\n\nThe script it launches each minute (don't forget to make it executable) is:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [[ ! `ipconfig getifaddr en1` ]]; then\n    /usr/sbin/networksetup -setairportpower en1 off\n    /usr/sbin/networksetup -setairportpower en1 on\n    echo `date` >> \"/Users/me/Library/Logs/wifisharingup.err\"\nelse\n    touch \"/Users/me/Library/Logs/wifisharingup.out\"\nfi\n\nI think the simple periodically (each minute) call to ipconfig getifaddr en1 refreshes something in what is the wifi sharing daemon.  Whatever it is, any moment the wifi sharing fails, it looses the self assigned IP address, and then, ipconfig getifaddr en1 fails, so my script totally resets wifi, making it rebuild its previous status and recovering the wifi-sharing.\nIt has been working for days so far inside a MacMini without keyboard, mouse or monitor, but only plugged into the Ethernet and giving my wifi gadgets access to the world.\n\nA: To start Internet Sharing from the CLI:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.InternetSharing.plist\n\nTo stop, change the load to unload.\nNote that if you have the pref pane open when you run this you will not see the change take effect immediately (the UI won't update), but it does work.\n\nA: I took a cue from mankoff's answer and wrapped it up in an AppleScript. I'm using this script from Automator so that I can easily use it as a service and give it a keyboard shortcut.\nToggle Internet Sharing:\nregister_growl()\n\ntry\n    if isRunning(\"InternetSharing\") then\n        do shell script \"launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.InternetSharing.plist\" with administrator privileges\n\n        if isRunning(\"InternetSharing\") then\n            error \"Internet Connection Sharing was Not Disabled\"\n        else\n            my growlnote(\"Success\", \"Internet Connection Sharing Disabled\")\n        end if\n\n    else\n        do shell script \"launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.InternetSharing.plist\" with administrator privileges\n\n        if isRunning(\"InternetSharing\") then\n            my growlnote(\"Success\", \"Internet Connection Sharing Enabled\")\n        else\n            error \"Internet Connection Sharing was Not Enabled\"\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\non error errMsg\n    my growlnote(\"Error\", errMsg)\n\nend try\n\non isRunning(processName)\n    try\n        return 0 < length of (do shell script \"ps ax | grep -v grep | grep \" & processName)\n    on error\n        return false\n    end try\nend isRunning\n\non register_growl()\n    try\n        tell application \"GrowlHelperApp\"\n            set the notificationsList to {\"Success\", \"Warning\", \"Error\"}\n            register as application \"Toggle Internet Connection Sharing\" all notifications notificationsList default notifications notificationsList icon of application \"Sharing\"\n        end tell\n    end try\nend register_growl\n\non growlnote(growltype, str)\n    try\n        tell application \"GrowlHelperApp\"\n            notify with name growltype title growltype description str application name \"Toggle Internet Connection Sharing\"\n        end tell\n    end try\nend growlnote\n\n\nA: I use the following script to toggle internet sharing on an early 2011 MacBook Pro / 10.11.3 El Capitan, so with newer hardware you might get away with shorter delays.

{"text": "Q: Why can Mac OS X 32-bit access all 4GB of memory, while Windows 32-bit can't? I don't understand why Mac OS X 32-bit kernel can access all 4GB of memory (and even more) while Windows 32-bit can only work with ~ 3,3 GB, and for using more than 4GB you need 64-bit Windows. Even when 32-bit Windows runs on Mac hardware with > 4GB mem, it still doesn't use it all. Sorry for talking about Windows on this site :-), I would just like to understand the difference.\n\nA: via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension\n\nTo use PAE, operating system support is required. Intel versions of Mac OS X support PAE. The Linux kernel supports PAE as a build option and most major distributions provide a PAE kernel either as the default or as an option. FreeBSD and NetBSD also support PAE as a kernel build option.\nMicrosoft Windows implements PAE if booted with the appropriate option, but current 32-bit desktop editions enforce the physical address space within 4GB even in PAE mode. According to Geoff Chappell, Microsoft limits 32-bit versions of Windows to 4GB due to a licensing restriction, and Microsoft Technical Fellow Mark Russinovich says that some drivers were found to be unstable when encountering physical addresses above 4GB.\n\n\nA: From here: http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/231766-45-windowsxp-recognizing\n\"Windows XP Professional 32-bit is limited to 4GB of address space. If you have 4GB of RAM installed, it will not show 4GB within Windows. What you'll probably get is the size of your pagefile subtracted from the 4GB.\nSome of this address space is reserved for hardware and the OS... so you'll never have access to the full 4GB anyway. If you want to access 4GB+ of RAM... your best solution is to pick up XP Pro 64-bit... but that will only work if your P4 CPU has EMT64.\"\nA more detailed answer can be found at: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/dude-wheres-my-4-gigabytes-of-ram.html\n\nA: Recommended reading: Road to Mac OS X Snow Leopard: 64-bits, Santa Rosa, and more (and the rest of Prince McLean's Road to Snow Leopard series).  If you don't want that much reading, I'll summarize:\nFirst, you have to realize that OS X doesn't have a single 32/64-bit mode switch like Windows does; It'll happily run 64-bit apps under a 32-bit kernel, or vice versa, and both of those are independent of what the physical memory subsystem can support.  Mind you, the bitness of apps and kernel do impose memory limits: an app running in 32-bit mode can only address 4GB of virtual memory no matter how much is installed/supported in the machine (although a Mac with lots of RAM can run several fully-resident 4GB processes at once); and if the kernel is in 32-bit mode it can only allocate up to 4GB for its various data structures (page table, process table, open file table, etc).  This is already a bit different from the way Windows does it, as it shares address space between the kernel and the running process, so they each only get 2GB.  The advantage of the Windows method is that it doesn't require a cache flush to switch in and out of the kernel, making it faster.  But OS X only needs to flush the cache if both the program and kernel are in 32-bit mode; if either is 64-bit, they share space and avoid the speed penalty.\nNow, on to the question you're asking about: physical RAM limits.  Many early Intel Macs actually have the same ~3GB memory limit that 32-bit Windows has, for the same reason: some of the 4GB physical address space is taken up by memory mapped I/O, especially the video card.  Some later Macs used the Santa Rosa support chipset, which allowed them to put the I/O in a separate address space, and use up to 4GB of physical RAM.  Higher-end (/even newer) Macs have PAE, which allows much more physical RAM.  Rumor is that Windows doesn't support PAE in most of their 32-bit OSes because of driver compatibility problems.  Apple controls most of the relevant drivers anyway, so they made it work; if the hardware supports it, the OS just uses it.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2498", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}

{"text": "Q: Where can I get install discs for OS X 10.5 to max out a Powerbook G4? Over the past year, my dad's Powerbook G4 (OS X 10.3) lost the ability to run any usable version of firefox or other end of life PPC software. Apple customer service wouldn't sell him a copy of 10.5 and told him to search ebay for copies of OS X 10.5, 8 months after releasing 10.6. We've been watching ebay and the price just keeps climbing above the original price.\nI told him to buy a copy of 10.6 and the license should allow for installing older versions. He took it to a 3rd party Mac dealer and they said they couldn't install 10.5 if he doesn't own a 10.5 license (which no one will sell anymore). Does the OS 10.6 license cover older versions of OS X? Can 10.5 be obtained for the original price anywhere?\n\nA: Firstly, I'm not sure where you heard that 10.6 shipped less than six months ago. It actually shipped in August 2009, making it over 12 months old.\nOld system software tends to sell at a premium. I'm not sure why, but it may be at least partially because Apple no longer produces them. However, as Apple only sells 10.6 as a stand-alone OS (that is, it doesn't sell upgrade versions, just full) you can legitimately buy 10.5 from anyone with a copy who has since upgraded to 10.6.\nThere are plenty of places to buy 10.5 if you're willing to shop around. Keep an eye on this search and this search and see what turns up. For instance, this eBay sale is currently going for $40.\n\nA: No the 10.6 license doesn't cover 10.5, and no, you won't find it anywhere for the original price.\nI'm assuming his powerbook is running 10.4?  To be perfectly honest, 10.5 runs like crap on a G4.  I have a 1.67 PBG4 and firefox runs so slow that it's unusable.  Take a look at the PPC optimized builds of firefox at http://firefoxmac.furbism.com/.  Or try Opera, it's been much better for me.\nStick with 10.4, 10.5 will slow him down even worse!\nedit\nSince apparently I can't read, this answer may not have much relevance.  However, I'd still advise against moving up to 10.5.  If you can get your hands on 10.4, I think that would be the way to go.  Firefox and most other apps are still supporting 10.4.\n\nA: So Apple will actually sell you a copy of OS X 10.5, Leopard, for $130 through 1-800-MY-Apple. They just tell you to look at eBay first, and will push back a few times before relenting and offering to sell you the upgrade.\nNot everyone you talk to at Apple may know this, so you may have to talk to more than one rep. One of the leads at the local apple store knew this.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2514", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: How can I burn a CD from iTunes and include CD track names and cover art image I want to burn a CD from iTunes and include a picture of my own as the cover art. So then when people stick the CD into their computer, it shows a picture in iTunes in the cover art section.\n\nA: You can't.\nCD do not contain any image anywhere. What happen when you insert the CD is that iTunes looks at the number of songs, their length, the length of silence between song and derives a number from it. It then asks the iTunes Store to find if a CD with this pattern exists. If it does the iTunes Store returns the cover art and all the metadata about the CD (Artist, album name, song names...).\nFor CDs you burned yourself you can't provide this information to iTunes just from the CD. Unless you find a label to release your CD to the masses and then Apple will add it to its list.\n\nA: There is a format called CD-Text that allows you to include track data (but not cover art, AFAICT), and iTunes lets you enable that format as an option. In the screenshot bmike posted, you can see \"Include CD Text\" as an option under Audio CD--that's how to enable this. I just tried it on my machine and the option is grayed out--apparently not all drives can write this format.\nThis wikipedia article has more information and lists a number of programs that can burn the format.\nWhether the recipients of the disc can do anything useful with the extra information is another question.\n\nA: If you burn the songs as a Data Disc or a MP3, iTunes includes the music files with the correct tags. If your songs have artwork embedded into the song files, your friends will get all the information and artwork you have prepared for them without needing iTunes to retrieve the artwork as a second step.\n\nThere are many tutorials and scripts on the internet to help you through the process. Just embed, and change the export options to keep your artwork with the music.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2515", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

For old MacBook Pro that's all you need. For more recent models you need to add a adapter. Apple has one, but I don't like it: It's really short and put pressure on the port when the computer is used on a support. Not to mention ugly. I bought on ebay a 6 foot Mini DisplayPort/DVI cable for cheap, it's all digital so you don't need huge shielding and \"super copper wire balanced to give you the best image\". Around 10 quids.\nNote: Smaller models like the MacBook and the Macbook Air came with different ports: A mini DVI or a micro DVI. For the people reading this with a non \"pro\" model, make sure you check for those as well...\nPS: You can find pictures of the various ports by searching for their names on Wikipedia.

{"text": "Q: Sync iTunes U between 2 Macs via an iPod Is it possible to download lectures (from iTunes U) with iTunes on Mac A, sync an iPod to Mac A, then carry that iPod to Mac B, and finally watch them on Mac B?\nThat's what I have been doing with my previous iPod (not an iPod Touch) because it allows me to use it as a USB hard drive. Now that I'm using an iPod Touch (which doesn't allow me to see what's inside), I wonder if I can use syncing to do the same job.\n\nA: Actually, there is a way you can sync your device to more than one iTunes library in different computers. The trick is making the device believe that it is the same library.\nEach library has an associated identifier. By modifying one of the libraries and putting the id of the other, you will accomplish that.\nIn order to do so, select one of the computers, the one that you are currently syncing with, and find out its identifier. Look for a file called iTunes Music Library.xml. In a Mac, this file is in the ~/Music/iTunes directory (though I think it can vary depending on what version of iTunes it was created with). In a PC, I guess it must be somewhere under the My Documents folder.\nOpen it with a text editor and find out a line which reads like\n<key>Library Persistent ID</key><string>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</string>\n\nwhere the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX will be the identifier for that library.\nNow, on the second computer, find out the same file, and, after making a backup (just in case), and making sure iTunes is not running, copy the identifier to a new document, because we'll need it shortly, and then replace it with the identifier from the first computer. Now, we're halfway done. The following step is the difficult one.\nWith a hex editor (which is an editor that allows editing the bytes of a binary file; my PC using mates recommend Ultraedit, while I on the Mac like HexFiend), open a file called iTunes Library in the same directory (remember, make a backup first), and do a search for the same string (or rather, byte string) that you copied and replace it with the new one from the first computer.\nAfter performing these steps, you should be able to sync both computers with the same device without problems.\n\nA: It won't let you sync, but you should be able to connect the iPod touch to Mac B and still see the iPod under devices in iTunes.  If you hit the expansion triangle (twistie?  whatever it's called) it should show you the playlists on that iPod and let you play them through iTunes.\n\nA: Syncing an iPod/iPhone to iTunes is a one-to-one relationship between the two. Syncing on iPod with an iTunes install essentially ties it to that iTunes. Syncing later to a different iTunes install invariably results in the \"delete all data\" dialog.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2528", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

[1]: http://www.immense.net/contactmover/\n\nA: This is similar to Jason's answer but quicker as it's more integrated.\nYou'll need two Apple devices (such as an iPhone and an iPad or possibly a Mac).  I've gone into details but it's actually easy and reliable.\nIn the following instructions we'll be moving contact(s) from source group 'A' (selected on the iPhone) to target group 'B' (on the iPad).  It doesn't matter which device is used for what role; in the end, both devices can still show contacts from both groups, if so desired.\n\n*\n\n*Ensure iPhone and iPad both have Bluetooth enabled. On both devices go to Settings -> General -> AirDrop and ensure either \"Contacts Only\" (or \"Everyone\") is selected.\n\n*iPhone: open Contacts, click on 'Groups' (top left) and select only group 'A'; do the same thing on the iPad but select only group 'B'.\n\n*iPad: go to Settings -> Contacts and make sure group 'B' is set as \"Default Account\".\n\n*iPhone: select a contact you want to transfer, tap \"Share Contact\", then select your iPad with the AirDrop symbol (blue circles over white background).\n\n*iPad: click \"Save\" on the top right hand corner of the contact card that has just appeared.\n\n*(optional but advisable): iPhone, click 'Edit' on top-left of the contact card you have just transferred, scroll to the bottom of the card, press 'Delete' and confirm deletion.  If you don't do this, you'll end up with duplicates (one in each group 'A' and 'B').\n\n*Repeat steps 4, 5 and 6 ad nauseam.\n\nOnce you're done transferring the contacts, you may re-select the groups you care about in the Contacts app of both devices (step 2).  It may also be worth checking that the Default Account (step 3) is set to something sensible on all your devices if you find that new contacts land in the wrong group.\nThese instructions refer to iOS 15; this likely works similarly on older and newer versions.\n\nA: I am using a free iPhone application to manage groups of contacts.\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/easy-group/id461469079?l=fr&ls=1&mt=8\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2529", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "38"}}

Is this correct?)\n\n\nA: Try typing\nsay Mac OS X\n\nin Terminal. You'll hear what Apple thinks about it.\nHint: It's \"mac oh es ten\"\n\nA: According to Apple\n\nThe current version of Mac OS is Mac OS X  (pronounced \"Mac O-S ten\"). ... . Major releases of Mac OS X include versions 10.0, 10.3, and 10.4. There are also updates (sometimes called \"dot\" releases) for each major release, such as versions 10.2.8 and 10.4.2. \n\nThis does present a problem because it isn't correct to write Mac OS X.6. All references to Mac OS X 10.6, are easier to pronounce as \"Oh Ess [Ex] ten dot/point six,\" rather than saying, \"ten,\" twice.\nAs for Darwin,\n\nThe Darwin layer of Mac OS X comprises the kernel, drivers, and BSD portions of the system [...]. Mac OS X extends this low-level environment with several core infrastructure technologies that make it easier for you to develop software. \n\nApple purchased NeXT for their XNU kernel, which is a hybrid kernel forked from CMU's Mach microkernel. BSD is an implementation of Unix originally released through UC Berkley. Aqua is the rendering engine for the user interface. The Apple Finder is a system application that always runs for user access to files and the desktop. OS X is the sum of these and other parts.\n\nA: starting with mountain lion it's no longer \"mac os x\"\nit will be just \"OS X\" pronounced o s ten.\n\nA: From: http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22541\nThe current version of Mac OS is Mac OS X (pronounced \"Mac O-S ten\")\n\nA: Mac Oh-Ess Ten\n\n\"Darwin\" (People use this to refer to the operating system. Is this correct?)\n\nOnly partially. Darwin is the open-source unix-derived foundation of the operating system upon which GUI-goodness, frameworks, application environments, core services and other proprietary bells and whistles are laid.\n\nA: They call it Macaussexx on the Dev Show (it's a joke though).\n\nA: I know what it's supposed to be, but every time I speak it, it comes out of my mouth like \"Mac Oh-Ess Ecks\".\n\nA: Apple uses different names for different versions of the Mac operating system, as well as gradually migrating from version number to preferring version names. The Apple Style Guide shows how to write them, but not how to pronounce them. Combining that with various other sources, I get:\n\n*\n\n*10.0 through 10.7: Write \"Mac OS X\", and pronounce it \"Mac O-S ten\" (source, from SpecKK's answer).

You need an internet connection for this process.\nI know this is a terrible answer to my own question.\n\nA: As far as I can tell there's only two was to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put a SIM card in from another network.\n\n*Call your operator and trust their answer. \n\n\nThe Google doesn't offer much more help than this either. \n\nA: How many Apple devices do you have?

{"text": "Q: Upgrade time machine storage? I'm going to buy 2T external HDD to replace my already full 1T HDD external. I want to keep the time machine backup data. In this case, is it just OK to copy all the time machine backup data in 1T HDD to 2T HDD? \n\nA: I know this might be old, but here are the right steps to perform a Time Machine hard drive replacement preserving old backups, without having to use CCC or SuperDuper! (which I love, but are not needed). \nI have a Mac Pro so to make things more complicated I added Two drives and created a RAID-1 (Mirror); once the mirror was working, I proceeded with these steps (sans the \u201cplug drive\u201d) ;)\nThe above comment is to demonstrate that the volume composition doesn\u2019t affect this. \nLike with any other Hard Drive operation, always make sure you have a backup or a way to restore your information in case something goes wrong. Read before you click \u201cok\u201d. Use common sense and be careful. \nYou need to be familiar with Disk Utility (located in /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app). It\u2019s a very simple and straightforward application, but also very dangerous if you go coo coo and start clicking things without reading.\nTIME MACHINE HARD DRIVE MIGRATION TO A NEW DRIVE PRESERVING BACKUP HISTORY\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your new (presumably bigger) drive. Using Disk Utility, create the HFS+ Journaled partition (make sure you use GUID to avoid problems). Give it a name like: NewTM (you can change that later). (This may be obvious but if you have a Mac Pro, turn it off before inserting the drives\u2026) \n\n*Open the Time Machine configuration and turn off Time Machine. \n\n*Unmount the Time Machine drive (the \u2018old\u2019) and mount it again. This causes the drive to be mounted as a regular drive and not have the \u201cTime Machine\u201d Green Icon. (This is important). You can do that from Disk Utility. \n\n*Now go back to Disk Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app) and click on the restore tab. \n\n*You will see two boxes to type, but you can also drag and drop, so drag the \u201cTimeMachine\u201d (old) to the source box (the upper one).\n\n*Drag the new \u201cNewTM\u201d partition to the target box (lower one). \n\n*IMPORTANT: select \u201cErase Destination\u201d so there\u2019s a block level copy.\n\n*Click restore and make sure that you have the right partitions (i.e.: read what you are being shown in the popup, it\u2019s your last chance or you could erase your data.) When you\u2019re satisfied, click ok to the popup and go cook. My 750gb took over four hours (and it was a SATA drive). Consider that USB drives (and even Firewire 800) are slower than any SATA internal drive. Some people reports this to take over five hours over USB for much smaller drives, so be patient.\nHere\u2019s how mine looked:\n\n\n\nIf everything went right, you should see two identical drives on your desktop, that is because the old drive was \u201cfully duplicated\u201d in the new one. The difference should be the free space, the new one should have more (if you are using a larger drive of course).\nWe\u2019re almost done, but we need to activate Time Machine again. \n\n\n*Unmount the old Time Machine drive. If you are unsure which one it is, check the free space and/or physically disconnect it; don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be able to use it again soon.\n\n*Open the TimeMachine configuration screen again and press Change Drive. Select the new one (should be the only one called Time Machine). The disk should now turn \u201cgreen\u201d with the Time Machine icon. Congratulations, you\u2019ve migrated your Time Machine. \n\n\nWhat now?\nTest it. Use Time machine to see if your files are there, recover some old files to see if they come, make sure everything is ok, you can reconnect your old drive and format it, or use it for furniture if you want. \nIf you previously had Spotlight configured to exclude your Time Machine, you might want to make sure that everything is ok. Maybe you\u2019ll have to drag the Time Machine drive again. Just check it. \nAnd that\u2019s all. I hope you don\u2019t destroy your data in the process. I came up with these steps by googling, experimenting and using common sense :) Hope it helps. \n\nA: I did some searching and found this (the caveat being that this applies to 10.5):\n\nUsing the Restore feature in Disk Utility, you can \"restore\" the Time Machine disk to another disk and retain the history of changes. This could be useful if you've outgrown your Time Machine backup drive, and want to migrate your existing backups to a new, larger drive. You should turn Time Machine off before doing starting this process, of course.\nBe aware that the disks will have the same name and information, so it might confuse Time Machine. For example, after I activated Time Machine on the newly-created disk, I plugged in the old disk, and it showed up as a Time Machine drive, but the backup failed. It's probably best to avoid having both of them plugged in. At the very least, rename one of them.\nPerhaps more importantly, Carbon Copy Cloner 2.3 doesn't work correctly for cloning a Time Machine drive (I don't know about 3.x), as it doesn't copy hard links but rather, copies what the links point to. This results in a lot of copies of your system when the Time Machine database has been around for a while.\n\nThe common suggestion from that thread is for CCC is to a block-to-block copy of the old disk to the new disk.\n\nA: SuperDuper! works fine for me. I just changed my Time Machine disk last week and history is still there.\n\nA: I think if you do 2 below steps can do it: \n\n\n*\n\n*Turn Time Machine off before copy all time machine back up data to new HDD.\n\n*Your new disk should have the same name(information) of old disk.\n\n\nbut general solution is to use Carbon Copy Cloner but somewhere I read that this was not work properly.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2570", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "11"}}

I'm looking for RAM+HDD+Keyboard and a Mouse in the most economical margins.\n\nA: Firstly, WELCOME to Apple world :)\nNow, this is not that hard, and you should think it's quite easy.\nif you never worked on a Mac before, you should invest some minutes to see some basic stuff, how it used to work on Windows and how it does now on Mac, for example, take some nice video tutorials from Apple website\ngo to Apple.com -> click on Mac -> down there there is several video tutorials, see some.\n\nRegarding UPGRADING your Mac Mini, you should check what model you have and have a look on MacSales Videos on how to replace the hardware\nyou will find all models in the Mac Sales Tech Support page\n\nAbout what hardware you should fit into your new Mac Mini, using Mac Sales you can order the memory, harddrive (or SSD) and any Optical drive as well, if you outside US, (though I'm in Denmark, I buy stuff from them time to time) you grab the model number of what you wanted, and \"fly\" to a near store and buy it :)\nI hope it helps.\n\nWarning\nYou are trying to buy 8Gb of Ram, and your mac only support up to 4Gb, in witch 3Gb is addressable.\nPlease read the specifications of your model before you buy anything!\n\n\nA: For discs I would not install inside but add a firewire external disk (your mini has FW 400). It might even run faster than the internal.\nFor memory I would get third party but see video tutorials on how to do it\nTo find the memory you need to know which mini you have info See on Apple's site support.apple.com/specs/#macmini enter the mini's serial number to get the correct one. I think from your comments(the disc size)  it is 2007 or early 2009 - that does not take the memory you are looking at\nFor memory from crucial use their Crucial Memory Advisor tool and choose the correct version of the hardware\nFor mice, keyboards etc any USB one will do\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2597", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: Why is the message body not displayed in iPhone's mail app? The normal mail app correctly shows a list of mails in my mailbox including a preview of the message body. When I tap any of them, the mail opens and correctly shows the mail header (sender, subject, date etc.) but the message body is blank.\nWhen I look at the same mailbox using Gmail webpage, I see the identical mails with message body intact so I know that it's not a problem with the mails or the mailbox itself.\nI'm using not-broken iOS 4.1 on an originally Apple-unlocked iPhone 4.\nI'm using Google's official setup for Google Apps on iPhone.\nI've tried purging the mail/contacts/calendar settings and following Google's setup from scratch. The problem is still there.\nHow can I fix it so the message body is displayed?\nResponse to answer:\n- This used to work flawlessly, but appeared recently, without any obvious change by me.\n- It might have been broken by the 4.0.2-->4.1 upgrade?\n- The problem appears on wifi and on GPRS/3G, in any location, and isn't related to download delays (keeping a \"blank\" message open for a minute doesn't make it appear).\n- It also isn't fixed by rebooting the phone.\nFollow-up:\nThis is very weird.

I honestly have no clue what's going on.\n\nA: Has this setup ever worked?\nHave you tried just using plain vanilla IMAP?\nIs this possibly due to poor connectivity\u2014maybe you have a weak network connection and it's just blank until the entire message downloads?\n\nA: Sometimes force quitting the Mail app forces a reload of the message.\n\n\n*\n\n*press home to exit mail\n\n*double tap the home screen button \n\n*tap mail and hold until the icon shakes and a red  minus sign shows on the multitasking icons\n\n*then tap the minus sign on Mail\n\n\nOn iPad IOS 8:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press home to exit mail.\n\n*Double tap the home screen button to show running apps.\n\n*Scroll left or right to show the mail app.\n\n*Swipe the mail app preview up and off the screen to end the app.\n\n\nLaunch Mail and cross your fingers. This worked for me on my 4s.\n\nA: So i had this problem and i solved it. Basically you need to reset the settings of the network you are using i.e. Wifi or 3G. Once those specific settings are reset. Input any necessary APNs and usernames and passwords if required to access the net. Now restart your phone and then go to your mail program and Voila. It should be back to normal. It worked for me.\nEinstein\n\nA: I had this problem to, I restarted my iPhone and the problem went away.\n\nA: The suggestion provided for Einstein solved my problem too (body of emails not showing).\nJust to expand a bit on what I did to \"reset\" network settings, it was only a matter of going to: Settings/General/Network and  there, turn \"off\" all the options (\"enable 3G\" and \"Celular Data\"). Then, just in case, before turning back on these options, I also went to Settings/Wi-Fi and turned that option off as well. After that, went back to Settings/General/Network and turned back on the options I had turned off. \nThe problem was solved right away, since I went to check emails immediately and found all emails had their body content available.\nIn case this doesn't work (I had tried other options I'd been suggested somewhere else), such as making sure the date of the device was right (which is another possible source of the \"no email body problem\", I adjusted email settings and had it show 5 lines of email preview (the max), which worked fine while I found the final solution written above.  To do this, go to Settings/Mail, Contacts, Calendars and scroll down until you get to the email section, where you adjust the \"preview\" option to 5 lines.\nI hope any of these solves your problem.\n\nA: I used a combination but what worked was to go to Settings then General then down to Network and select Reset Network Settings. Let the phone restart and you will have to re-enter any passwords to wireless networks but all email issues were fixed\n\nA: I ran into this problem today. But, shutting down and restarting my phone solved the problem. Very strange.\n\nA: Shutting down, waiting for a minute, and turning my computer back on solved this problem for me.\n\nA: It magically started working again after 5 days. \nI've no idea why this problem started, and no idea what fixed it. But it was no dream!\n\nA: I just had this problem with my iPhone running iOS 5.1. Killing mail and reopening it fixed it (for now at least).\n\nA: The problem happened suddenly for me, but the restart solved it!

{"text": "Q: Battery warning ''Service battery\" Battery warning \"Service battery\". This warning have appeared in my MacBook Pro (2008) with Snow Leopard. Is there a way to find out what a reason of this warning, without apply to service centre?\n\nA: This means your battery is at the end of its life. This happens to all batteries, sooner or later, depending on your type of usage and most importantly on the amount of cycles (i.e. full recharges).\nYour battery will probably not last longer than one hour at this stage. You can of course try to train it by letting it drain the battery until the MacBook sleeps and then recharge it up to 100%, leave it recharged for at least a few hours, and then repeat this process a few times. By doing this, you sort of \"reset\" the battery and can get a few minutes more out of it. It helped me get at least 20 minutes more.\nIf OS X tells you to service battery, it means that you will need to buy a new battery if you want full capacity back. There is no warranty that would cover worn out batteries. I had had the same problem, but unless your battery has less than 200 cycles, this is absolutely normal and you should buy a new battery. Again, Apple will not replace your battery unless it's almost unused.\n\nA: It's most likely because your battery is nearing the end of its useful life.  Your battery has a maximum charge capacity that decreases with age and use.  You can see the current capacity in Utilities --> System Profiler --> Hardware --> Power --> Full charge capacity (mAh):.\nHowever, this doesn't tell you what your original Full charge capacity was.  For this, you either need to look up the specs of your laptop, or use a utility like CoconutBattery.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2638", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "12"}}

{"text": "Q: How to record the screen of an OpenGL application without stuttering? I'm currently recording videos of my screen using QuckTime Player and a MacBook Pro 13\" (mid-2010) in a resolution of 640x480. The application I'm recording is called Synthesia (it is a game like Guitar Hero for piano) and is based on OpenGL.\nSomehow all videos I record do have a subtile stuttering which I think is annoying (see an example here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEBAKQ4-Zcg).\nIs there a program that will do a better job at recording my screen than QuckTime Player, or is it just my MacBook Pro that is not powerful enough?\n\nA: The reason for the \u201cstuttering\u201d could be a combination of different factors.\nFirst is of course your computer\u2019s power and video card. The more power you have, the more the number of FPSs your computer can \u201crecord\u201d. \nDespite that, QuickTime is not known for its \u201cfast\u201d recording, so I suggest you give a try to different alternatives. This comparison is a little bit \u201coutdated\u201d because some (if not most) of the applications mentioned have been updated and have fixed or changed some of the problems they had, however, it should be a starting point for your final QUickTime Replacement. This other link has a very similar list, but rather than a review is a list with a short description of the products.\nFor reference, the most important Screen Capture tools for OS X (or to put it in another way, the \u201cmost used ones\u201d) are (in no particular order): iShowU, Snapz Pro X, ScreenFlow and one that is missing from those lists (because it\u2019s a new player in the Mac world): Camtasia for Mac (which I\u2019ve been betatesting and it\u2019s quite good and in par with the ones I\u2019ve mentioned). Some features missing from Camtasia 1.0 have been addressed in an update and I know they are working on a newer version after getting tons of feedback in the Beta forums (which I can\u2019t disclose because I participated).\nI\u2019ve personally tried those four I\u2019ve mentioned (i have a Snapz Pro license) and I think they more or less are the same, but some were (when I tried them) faster than others but lacked certain features. All in all, the \u201cbest\u201d doesn\u2019t exist, they all have strengths and weaknesses so your best bet is to give them a try and see if one does the job.\nLast but not least, remember that quality also plays an important factor in CPU overhead when recording, try to keep your CPU load low and reduce the recording quality as much as you can afford. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2653", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

Same happens to me with \"Compare Files\" contextual menu (I think that's the issue) and certainly with files opened from DreamWeaver. \nThere has been some change / fix in Apple OS because DW tries to open the same file in Chrome without \"Volume\" before the partition name, and the same file opened in Chrome reveals \"Volume\" which works.\nSo either Adobe or Apple made a change or made a fix on the way they point/call a partition other than the startup disk in that same drive.\nSo in the OP case, the name of the drive IS backup. The problem is the aliases have \"Volume\" added to it. I think at some point the startup disk was meant to NOT include \"Volumes\" and later they fixed it for the Finder and other obvious places but they didn't get to the aliases yet.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2656", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

Are the apple fanboys more active here?\n\nA: Better question: If the output from iCal was readable, would it be sufficient?

On the print dialog, there's an option to print only the selected event. Also, the day option or list option will print the full contents without messing up the formatting or overwriting other lines.\nIn other ways iCal in Lion is worse, but it's definitely better for printing calendar entries.\n\nA: If we're talking about a single invite, and you wanted to go backwards in time and rely on paper (again) you could print the email invite.

{"text": "Q: How do you maximize windows? Unlike Windows, you cannot maximize a window in Mac with a click of the button. The little green (+) button next to the red and yellow buttons at the left of the windows does some strange stuff sometimes when you click it and doesn't do the expected operations.\nHow would you fully maximize a window on a Mac?\n\nA: BetterTouchTool, if you have a macbook pro which has a multitouch pad (I'm betting you do), it lets you assign thing like Windows style maximise to the very top middle of your touch pad. But you don't have to use it like that, as it has an AeroSnap type feature, where you can just drag a window to the top of the screen and it will truly maximise, also dragging it to the left/right will make the window take up the left/right side of the screen.\nI find the Mac version of maximise unsatisfactory for things like web page and xcode. And betterTouchTool has many good features.\n\nA: I use an inexpensive app, Cinch from Irradiated Software. Whenever I need to maximize a window, I just drag it from the titlebar to the top of the screen, and Cinch takes care of resizing it for me. If I need to unmaximize, I just move it a little out of its position and it is restored to its previous state. I wish there were some way to do it (automatically) without extra applications, provided with the default system, but I know not of it.\n\nA: Mac OS X does not have a button for maximizing windows, instead you should drag the bottom-right of the window to resize it to your prefered size.\nAnd meanwhile the green plus button at the top-left resizes the window so that it fits the content of that window. \n\nA: I use Spectacle. It's free and open source. The default key shortcut for maximizing windows is \u2318+F.\n\nA: On Yosemite:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double click the window top bar (Like in MS Windows)\n\n\nor \n\n\n*\n\n*Option-click the green dot in the top left.\n\n\nOn older OS X versions: Shift-click the green (+)\n\nA: I use Moom for that purpose, also for rearranging and moving my windows between monitors. You basically get the same keyboard based window management that windows 7 users get, just a lot more configurable.\nI have it setup so that Ctrl+ CMD + Left puts the window to the left side of the current display, Ctrl+ CMD + right to the right side, + Ctrl + CMD + Down to the next of my current monitors and finally Ctrl + CMD + Up to maixmize the window. Makes for some pretty quick and sleek work combinations (Two windows next to each other for comparision? 1 second, there you go :))\n\nA: Download and use RightZoom. It overrides your green plus (zoom) button and works like Windows maximize. You can add it to your login items in your user account to run every time you start OS X.\n \n\nA: I move the window to the top-left edge of the screen, and drag the window-sizing handle on the bottom-right corner of the window to the bottom-right edge of the screen.\nI don\u2019t have to do it very often, as windows seem to remember what size they were at.\n\nA: For many applications (Safari, Mail, Terminal, ...), simply command-clicking the + button will maximize the window.\n\nA: I've assigned this script to \u2325\u2318M. It doesn't work with all windows or with multiple displays though.\ntell application \"Finder\" to set {0, 0, dtw, dth} to bounds of window of desktop\ntry\n    tell application (path to frontmost application as text)\n        if name is in {\"Terminal\"} then\n            error\n        else\n            set bounds of window 1 to {0, 22, dtw, dth}\n        end if\n    end tell\non error\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell (process 1 where it is frontmost)\n        try\n            click (button 1 of window 1 where subrole is \"AXZoomButton\")\n        end try\n    end tell\nend try\n\n\nA: While pressing Alt, drag a corner of the window to that corresponding corner of your screen. It will expand the window in all directions, until the window takes up the full screen. \nThis is a simple way of doing it without having to download any additional programs, built right in to the OS, though it might be a bit more tedious. It works for all windows that can be resized, unlike some of the other solutions which work for specific apps.\n\nA: DoublePane - $4.99 does that by Ctrl+Option+Up. This is also can be done with Spectacle which is free on MAS\n\nA: If you are on macOS Sierra, you can do this: hold the Alt button and double click on the bottom left corner (or any other corner) of the screen to make the window take up the maximum amount of space with going into fullscreen mode.\n\nA: Move the mouse to the corner of the window where it becomes a resizing arrow and option double click to fill the screen, WITHOUT going into full screen mode.\nDouble clicking on any side when the resize arrow is visible will move that side to the edge of the screen.

{"text": "Q: What would I lose from switching from iPhone 4+ e-reader to dumbphone+iPad I'm currently using an iPhone 4 and a cheap e-reader that was given to me as a gift. I don't think I can afford both an iPhone and an iPad, so I was considering switching to a dumbphone (non-smartphone) and an iPad. What features would i lose, or miss, from making this switch - specifically in the iphone-ipad part?\n\nA: It seems to me that you would spend less money overall if you just kept the iPhone and got a wifi-only iPad rather than switching phones and plans (not including that nasty early termination fee on the iPhone contracts). That is what I have now and I really like it.\nBut, to answer your question specifically, even taking into consideration the iOS 4 release for iPad later this year, you will be missing, at minimum, all of the camera-related functionality of the iPhone, but then there is visual voicemail and easy (and cheap) email. That's a lot to give up all things considered.\n\nA: The internet, and a pretty great camera, in your pocket.\n\nA: In addition to the good answers already given, there's also:\n\n\n*\n\n*FaceTime\n\n*Video\n\n*Synchronization (you'd have to always manually update your phone contacts)\n\n\nAlso worth mentioning: if you buy a 3G iPad there's no monthly charge unless/until you sign a carrier agreement. IMO, you're always better off buying one with 3G if there's a >0% chance you'll need it someday. Yes, it's more money initially, but it's a one-time charge.\n\nA: Split the question into two separate items and make a decision about them:\n\n\n*\n\n*(Why) Do you want an iPad? \n\n*(Why) Do you want to replace your iPhone with a simpler one?\n\n\nFor instance, even if you get an iPad, it would still be convenient to keep the iPhone. Also, if you jailbreak your iPhone, you could broadcast your iPhone's Internet access as a local WIFI hotspot that your iPad could connect to = the cheaper WIFI-only iPad would suffice, rather than getting the 3G version when you're already paying for a 3G data plan for your iPhone.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2687", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: Best app to switch between all open windows After 4 years of being a Mac user, there is only one thing that I still miss from the Windows world, and that is being able to switch with a single keystroke between all open windows in the computer.\nWhat is the best app or utility, free or not, for accomplishing that?\nI've used Witch, but I never was completely satisfied with it. It's a bit slow and the switcher UI is not very pretty.\nDo you know any alternative?\n\nEDIT (2016): This question keeps getting views and upvotes after 6 years. When I asked this question in 2010 I was still transitioning from being a Windows user. Eventually, I got used to Mac OS X UI and nowadays I don't use any third party utility for managing app windows, just Mission Control and the native keyboard shortcuts. So, although this question is no longer relevant for me I hope it is useful to new Mac users making the switch (Including this comment).\n\nA: I know it isn't a single keystroke but I like using the \"App expos\u00e9\" feature to navigate between the windows of the focused application :\n\n\n*\n\n*ctrl + down arrow (or three fingers down move)\n\n*then left arrow or right arrow to navigate between windows (or click on the window you chose)\n\n\nA: I've been using AltTab, an open source application, with success.\n\nAltTab brings the power of Windows\u2019s \u201calt-tab\u201d window switcher to macOS.\n\nAlt-Tab is open source software that can be built & installed locally, or can be installed directly from its website or through Homebrew:\nbrew cask install alt-tab\n\n\nA: I'm guessing you're already aware, but for those searching the web there's always Ctrl+F4. No visual feedback, but it does switch between all windows for all apps (that are not hidden) with one command. Of course it's instant and so it doesn't reorder the list like \u2318+Tab does. I also got tired of Witch, but I decided that most of the time \u2318+` is all I need.\n\nA: Senebier seems to be a good alternative to witch and it's free.\nhttp://www.bicoid.com/app/senebier/index.html\n\nA: https://contexts.co/\nContexts for mac is a competitor to Witch. As a long-time non-mac user looking for more intuitive window switching , I really like this app. It allows for switching between all the windows you have open, using your keyboard or your mouse.\nThere's also an optional side panel, which is somewhat a replacement for the Mac Dock. It can be configured to hide applications that don't have a window, and displays multiple icons for multiple windows. As such, irrelevant background applications are hidden and multi-window apps can be managed more easily. \nIf need be you can still use Apple's Native App-switcher (cmd+tab) to close/switch-to background/windowless applications without using the native dock.\n\nA: *\n\n*Quicksilver (or spotlight). You summon the App you are interested on, say Safari. \n\n*Using Mission Control's Show application windows (you can assign a shortcut to this using the keyboard icon on the system preferences) \n\n*Once all the application windows are being shown, you can type (there's no text field, you will just have to start typing) the title of the window you care. After a couple of keystrokes, your window will be selected. \n\n\nAt the beginning you'll be slow but as time goes by, you'll become pretty fast. \n\nA: It's interesting - no one has mentioned Karabiner.  it has ton of options for different things, the one I like called \"Tab mode\", where you can switch between apps by holding Tab key and using either arrows or HJKL keys (especially favored by Vim users). Tab+I to cycle through open windows of the current app. \nI love Karabiner, it's the app that made me really, really hate Windows (occasionally I have to do things in Windows). However even with awesome AutoHotkey app I couldn't find a way to use keyboard there as Karabiner lets me on a Mac.\nI encourage you to try Karabiner and explore vast amount of different options, trust me - it will change the way you use your keyboard.\n\nA: An app I developed, Optimal Layout (14$), gives you keyboard commands to quickly switch and re-organize windows. \n\nA: For those who don't know it, Ctrl+F4, Ctl+`, ... can be remapped in:\nSystemPreferences=>Keyboard=>Keyboard Shortcuts=>Keyboard & Text Input\n\n\nA: Command + Tab, combined with Command + `. Works great. \nLet me explain:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command + Tab : Switch between different applications.\n\n*Command + ` : Cycle between all open windows of the application you're focused on. (For example, if you have four Finder windows open, you can press Command + ` to move between the four windows.)\n\n\nIf this and other keyboard shortcuts seems to be broken, you probably have another keyboard-layout then US, The shortcuts actually aren't to the ` key but rather the key that would have ` on a US keyboard, to find what key this is on your layout, open the \"keyboard viewer\" and switch your layout to US, take notice on where the ` key is located, swich back to your normal layout and you can now use this button to switch windows. \nOn a swedish keyboard ` is the button next to 1 (\u00a7) on the small/laptop keyboard, and the key next to z (<) on the full size keyboard.\n\nA: Hyperswitch is free and works well. It also looks nice.\nUpdate: ...but unfortunately as of May 2021 the app is not being updated anymore and has no native Apple Silicon (M1) support.\n\nhttp://bahoom.com/hyperswitch\n\nA: Here's a list of all the options from this page:\n[\"italicized & quoted notes are sourced from linked url\"]\n\n*\n\n*Mission Control and native keyboard shortcuts: \u2318+tab or \u2318+` (backtick)\n\n*AltTab [\"macOS 10.12 to 12\"] [$0 (free), open source]\n\n*Witch [\"v4.3.8 requires macOS 10.10 Yosemite or newer\"] [$14]\n\n*Hyperswitch [\"Mountain Lion, Mavericks & Yosemite\"; works on Sierra & High Sierra] [$0 Free] [window preview]\n\n*Contexts [\"v3.7.1 Works on Mojave & Catalina\"] [$9 after Free trial]\n\n*Optimal Layout [Snow Leopard or later] [$0 (free) but not currently actively developed]\n\n*Karabiner - [\"macOS 11.0 Big Sur,\nmacOS 10.15 Catalina\"]\n\n*Senebier [\"10.4 or later\", last update in 2012]\n\n*Hammerspoon with hs.window.switcher [free and open source]\n\n*Command-Tab Plus [\"macOS 10.12 or later and is fully macOs Monterey ready\", 13.75 \u20ac]\n\n\nA: As mentioned in the question, Witch ($14) is one of the first window switchers and, IMHO, still one of the best.\nI suspect @Sergio (questioner) main concerns have now been addressed in Witch. I think its actually one of the better looking ones, with lots of options for tweaking appearance (including themes). It also feels very fast to me.\nAll that said, I am not currently using Witch because it doesn't support searching the window names. For that I was using Optimal Layout and am now trying out Contexts (which seems very promising).\n\nA: Been searching for a mac window swapper that INCLUDES MINIMIZED WINDOWS for ages. Little did I know, the function was already built into Quicksilver, sitting under my nose this whole time. It's an action called \"show all windows,\" which I've set as a trigger ( \u2318` for proximity to \u2318\u21e5).\nQuicksilver comes to the rescue once more (as usual).\n\nA: See also this question, where I posted the same answer.\nI am surprised / shocked that nobody mentioned hammerspoon. Aside, it can do much more than just window switching!\nFrom its webpage:\n\nThis is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine. What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user.\n\nUsing hs.window.switcher one just adds (as mentioned in the docs) to the init.lua\nswitcher_space = hs.window.switcher.new(hs.window.filter.new():setCurrentSpace(true):setDefaultFilter{})\nhs.hotkey.bind('alt','tab','Next window',function()switcher_space:next()end)\nhs.hotkey.bind('alt-shift','tab','Prev window',function()switcher_space:previous()end)\n\nand one can happily switch between windows in the current space using alt+tab and alt+shift+tab.\nEDIT:\nIn case it is rather slow, try turning of thumbnails and set the animation duration to 0.\nswitcher_space.ui.showThumbnails = false\nhs.window.animationDuration = 0\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2718", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "227"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I reduce the volume of music on my iPhone? Some songs on my iPhone are quite loud. I've got the volume on the lowest step, but it's still too loud. \nI'm using Apple's in-ear headset; perhaps it's simply louder than the regular one. At least I can play music at a much lower volume with it, so the \"perceived\" volume of the songs is louder.\nI have already turned on \"Sound Check\" in the Settings. That helped some already, but not enough.\nHow can I reduce the volume even further?\n\nA: Without resorting to using an audio program to normalize the tracks  (which you might eventually have to do if you want to make it \u201cthe right way\u2122\u201d), you can select the track(s) you want to lower in iTunes and CMD + i to \u201cget info\u201d, go to the Options tab and manually reduce the track\u2019s volume.\n\nYou can have multiple track selections and the adjustment will apply to all the selected tracks.\nI am not 101% sure if this is carried over the iPhone/iPad (although it should). If that\u2019s not the case, you will need an Audio Editor like Amadeus Pro (there might be others, I happen to have that one and it\u2019s very good, but might be overkill for what you need).\nIn your favorite editor, open the mp3 (or whatever format you have) and find the Audio Effect usually called Normalize and lower the dBs: \n\nIf you have to modify a lot of tracks, Amadeus Pro has a nice Batch Processor which is some sort of \u201cautomator\u201d home made. \n\nThe powerful batch processor allows you not only to convert large numbers of files between any of the supported formats, but you can also instruct Amadeus Pro to apply any sequence of sound effects.\n\nSee how I have added a Normalize \u221215dB to the \u201cactions\u201d.:\n\nnote: I don\u2019t work for HairerSoft or Amadeus.

It allowed me to group messages by year, because sometimes I needed a message that I got in 2008\u2026\nOf course I\u2019d add other conditions like not in spam/trash, etc. Sometimes you have to \u201cnest\u201d smartmailboxes.

{"text": "Q: Decimal comma in Spanish keyboard layout I have a Spanish layout keyboard (in Snow Leopard). Whenever I use the dot, or comma, in the numeric keyboad (right of the 0) it always shows a comma, but I'd prefer if it entered a dot, just like PCs do. Otherways, entering IP addresses, or decimal numbers when coding is a PITA. How can I do that?\nI have tried altering my regional settings so that the decimal separator is a point and the thousands separator is a comma, but that doesn't seem to affect text entry.\nI'd prefer changing some regional setting rather than remapping the keyboard, but I'll accept any answer that works - short of changing the regional layout of the keyboard, I really need my diacritics there.\n\nA: You need to change the layout of your keyboard. Not to another one, but to a new one that has been modified by an utility like Ukelele (there might be others).\nDownload the tool, drag the App to your Application folder. Notice that in the Disk Image, there\u2019s a folder called System Keyboards/Roman/, copy that to you desktop (it\u2019s temporal). \nLaunch Ukelele and from the File menu select: \u201cNew based on\u2026\u201d\nOpen the file Spanish-ISO.keylayout (found in the Roman folder that you saved to your desktop).\nYou\u2019ll see a big blue keyboard representing your current Spanish-ISO map (if you brought your computer in Spain, that\u2019s they keyboard you should use). \nDouble click on the \u201c,\u201d that you want to modify (or any other key) and you\u2019ll see this:\n\nReplace the \u201c,\u201d with the \u201c.\u201d (dot). And go to Keyboard Menu -> Set Keyboard Name. Rename the Spanish - ISO to something like: Spanish - ISO2.\nNow save it, the name will be Untitled, but you should put Spanish - ISO2.\nWhere do you save it?\nAccording to Ukelele\u2019s User Manual, you have different choices (and I suggest your read section 3.3 of the manual). Short answer is within the Keyboard Layouts sub-folder of the Library folder in your home folder. This can be created if it doesn\u2019t already exist. If you do that, only your user will see (and be able to use) this Layout. \nAfter installing the keyboard layout and logging out and logging in again, open the International pane of System Preferences (Language & Text on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and later). On the Input Menu (Input Sources in 10.6 or later) tab, your new keyboard layout should be listed there. Enjoy your faster IP Address typing.\n\nA: KeyRemap4MacBook solves this problem as well, without having to set up a completely different keyboard layout in Ukelele. Simply enable the \"Swap Dot and Shift+Dot\" option in the \"Change Keypad Key\" section. \n\nA: In macOS Sierra, you have to Ctrl+Shift+, in numeric pad to obtain a regular dot.\nFound this trying to do the same as everyone else and discovered it was different now.\nHope this helps.\nUPDATE: in macOS Mojave, you can also use Ctrl+Alt+, in numeric pad to obtain a regular dot. I found some apps (I'm looking at you Slack) don't allow the original answer, but do the update.\n\nA: Just discovered an alternative solution, and at least for me a much better one, which does NOT require keyboard remapping and works on other people's macs too:\npress shift when you press the comma on the numeric keypad, it will be entered as a point (at least in snow leopard (osx 10.6))\n(As I have a Belgian keyboard layout, I've used the keyboard remapping solution [using Ukulele] for some time, but it didn't play well with all applications, e.g. Eclipse)\n\nA: David's answer was extremely helpful! Give a try to KeyRemap4MacBook\nThe app is clumsy & little buggy but does the job.\nOn my Spanish - ISO keyboard layout had to enable/change:\n\n\n*\n\n*KeyPad-Dot(.) to Command+X (Cut) with Italian (What?)\n\n*KeyPad Comma(,) to Dot(.) on \"Italian Pro Input Source\"\n\n\nA: You can also use a tool like Keyboard Maestro. I\u2019ve set it up like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Triggered by: The Hot Key Key Pad . is pressed\n\n*Action: Insert Text \u2018,\u2019 by Pasting\n\n\nIt works surprisingly fast without having to create a new keyboard layout or remap keys.\n\nA: I use the app Better Touch Tool that allows you to do so all sorts of customizations with gestures and the keyboard.  I just added a keyboard assignment that essentially mapped shortcut \"pad ,\" to \".\" and it works perfectly.\n\nA: The app its now called Karabiner. I figure it out on spanish ISO but I think it can be applied to all layouts. \nIn the simple modifications tab, after you have set up the app: \n\n\n*\n\n*Select your target device on the list.\n\n*Add item in the bottom left corner\n\n*From Key: Keypad_period - To key: Period (.)\n\n\nA: There is NO need for an external program.\nCreate a file named DefaultKeyBinding.Dict under ~/Library/KeyBindings/ (/Users/<username>/Library/KeyBindings/), create the KeyBindings folder if it doesn't exists.\nPaste the text below inside the file, save it and restart/logout-login to make it work.\n{\n  \"#,\" = (\"insertText:\", \".\");\n}\n\nAlso, here is a gist with more configuration options.\n\nA: Ctrl+, (just for the comma in numeric keyboard) yields to a . (dot) when in spanish layout.\nOddly enough this works in terminal and in some text editors (like textwrangler). MacVim, for instance, just renders a . when using , in numeric keyboard. And TextMate just ignores this modifier and prints a ,\n... You know, the good thing about apple stuff is that it \"just works\".\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2767", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "12"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I map a middle click to control click? Just started to use a Mac for my new job and not being able to use the middle button to open links in a new tab is killing me. I know I can press control and do a regular click but it's not the same. I know the Mac knows I'm trying to do something because it beeps at me when I press the middle button on my mouse. Is there any hope?  \nNote I tried the trick about setting expose dashboard to - but it didn't work.\n\nA: Try holding the Command button instead. A Command click is a middle click. Control clicks give you a right click.\nWhat kind of Mac? If you're using a Magic Mouse you can use a program like MagicPrefs to turn a three finger click into a Command click. If you're using the Magic Trackpad or the built-in trackpad on a MacBook/MacBook Pro there is a program called MiddleClick I've used that adds a three finger tap/click ability to map to the Command click.\n\nA: Karabiner can be used to map mouse buttons.

How secure is the built-in protection ?\nCan thieves access the data on the hard drive, and at what difficulty?\n\nA: The current version of FileVault is secure against currently well-known attacks, if best practices are followed.\nSome older versions of FileVault had serious issues.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileVault#Issues and https://discussions.apple.com/message/18835839#18835839 ; both have more detail.  With older versions of and incautiously configured installations of MacOS, it's definitely easy to decrypt the contents of a FileVault-protected drive.  Fortunately, those known issues in older versions of FileVault have been fixed.\nGoogle for examples of some \"best practices\", such as the NSA's configuration guide for Mac OS X.\nWhat was protected by a password is a key question...  Do all accounts require a login password?  Is there a boot-time password as well?  Was Filevault (or other encryption software) used at all?  Were good password practices followed?   A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.\n\nA: If FileVault is not enabled, there are two easy ways to reset the login password in single user mode without even having access to another computer or installation media.\nIt doesn't reset the password of the login keychain, but the thief could still access most files normally. They couldn't use auto-fill in Safari or log in to accounts in Mail. But if you had set a webmail site to log in automatically and hadn't disabled the option to reset a password with an Apple ID, the thief could reset the Apple ID (it doesn't currently require answering security questions) and use it to reset the keychain password.\nThe hash of the login password (which is usually also the password of the login keychain) is stored in /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/username.plist in 10.7 and 10.8. In 10.7 it was easy to crack even relatively complex passwords by using DaveGrohl, but 10.8 switched to PBKDF2, which limits it to about 10 guesses per second per core.\n\nA: It depends on exactly what you mean by: \n\nit was protected with a password\n\nIf it means that they were using FileVault, then their data should be pretty much inaccessible.\nIf it just meant that they had a login password, though, all the thieves have to do is boot the laptop off another disk, and they'll have immediate access to everything on the internal drive.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2803", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}
{"text": "Q: What software alternatives support streaming via AirPlay? The Apple TV arrived! I'm slightly bummed that I can only stream from iTunes, and therefore only use formats that iTunes supports. I haven't found a single other video player that supports AirPlay, though to be fair, AirPlay has only really been around since the new Apple TVs started arriving.\nWhat other software supports streaming audio and video to AirPlay devices? If none, is AirPlay one of those closed Apple standards or have other projects pledged to support it?\n\nA: To date, there are no 3rd party software implementations of AirPlay. The spec itself is fully patented (though most of these patents relate to the hardware aspects of the system) and is essentially a proprietary standard unique to Apple (though several hardware vendors have announced hardware that will use the standard - XtremeMac, Denon). The current analysis of the protocol itself seems to indicate that it is a further evolution of the previous AirTunes protocol (which itself was built on top of Bonjour), so you are likely to see software implementations appear after developers have had more time to experiment with the protocol.\n\nA: Take a look at Airfoil.\n\nA: AirPlay is effectively a rebranding of AirTunes and adds video/photo streaming. The AirTunes protocol, called RAOP (really just RTSP w/ encryption) remains mostly unchanged. Video streaming is a different animal. My understanding is that its basically push DAAP.\n3rd-Party Software\nAudio-Only\nAirfoil\naudio|acacia\nVideo+Audio\nAirServer\nFor the sake of brevity and time, this list is non-exhaustive and I've only listed commercial software. I've personally noticed that some of the software products touting AirPlay/AirTunes support don't follow the protocols exactly and results vary. I guess you get what you pay for.\n\nA: I really like Beamer. It's a little pricey ($20), but it was money well spent, for me! It functions very similarly to the ChromeCast, in that you're not actually \"mirroring\" the content from your computer screen, but rather, casting it wirelessly to the Apple TV. It supports every major file format, to date, as well. What I like most about it, is that one can still thumb around on their computer, while streaming their shows and/or movies. That's always been a huge downfall of the AirPlay function, for me... I am not a fan of mirroring, at all!! Anyhow, hope that helps anyone who may have stumbled across this thread.    \n\nA: I know it is old question but it may help others.\nYou can try AirMyPC software.

{"text": "Q: What are Mac OS X diagramming tools like Visio on Windows? Visio is the most conspicuous example of a program that I found useful on Windows for which I have not identified a Mac-compatible equivalent.\nVisio's primary function is as a flowchart diagramming tool. It allows the user to construct complex information flows with smart objects and interconnect graphics that snap and bend as the user moves things around on the page. It evolved over the years to support other diagram and information flow views like IT diagrams and UI mockups.\nWhat's out there that can replace Visio on the Mac?\n\nA: We produce diagrams.net, it's not as complex as the named tool, but it does the majority of tasks in this field. It's free, plus there's a Desktop version available.\n\nA: As others have mentioned OmniGraffle is a great Visio replacement.  But if you want something free, I'd also recommend yED:\nhttp://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html\nI use it on my Linux-based systems, but since its java-based, it works well on Mac OS X, as well as Windows.\n\nA: Dia, it's not a native app, it uses x11 but it works ok.\nThere is also ConceptDraw PRO but this is another of those cross-plantform apps and doesn't work as well as OmniGraffle.\nI would probably still recommend OmniGraffle for Mac.\n\nA: OmniGraffle or OmniGraffle Pro: http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/feature_comparison/\n\nA: OmniGraffle is awesome, but quite pricy. If you're looking for Visio replacement for specifically UI mockups or really simple diagrams, you can use Balsamiq Mockups\n\nA: Check out GenMyModel, a new browser-hosted UML modeler, cross-platform and free. It works on Chrome, Firefox, IE and Safari (Mac OS) and provides UML-compliant modeling with code generation (java, SQL). It presently supports class diagrams and use case diagrams.

(there are other options which do have prices attached which isn't too bad) \n\n*It has a drag and drop feature which makes it easy to use and is very intuitive. \n\nA: I have just come across another nice (open source) application for creating Diagrams and Mockups - http://pencil.evolus.vn/. It is not as professional and powerful as Omnigraffle, but for many situations it probably is enough, namely simple diagrams and mockups (which can be exported as HTML). \nI also use some other solutions for diagrams (including UML diagrams), these are not for mockups: \n\n\n*\n\n*Yed: http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html\n\n*ArgoUml: http://argouml.tigris.org/\n\nA: An alternative viewer to the one mentioned in Donald B's answer is: \nEnolsoft Visio Viewer for Mac\nA smart file viewing tool to support the use of Visio files by Mac OS users, enabling them to view, save and print Microsoft Visio drawings and diagrams on Mac OS X 10.7 and higher.\n\n\n*\n\n*View Microsoft Visio Drawings in VSD format easily on Mac.\n\n*Convert Visio to PDF with original elements retained.\n\n*Support multi-tab viewing to switch between multiple Visio files easily.\n\n\nIt is a \"Paid-For\" product however it is available as a \"Free Trial\", to allow you to try before you buy (if so desired).\n\nA: While I love Omnigraffle, it isn't cost effective for most. A cheaper alternative for me was Diagrammix, especially since it allows me to use Omnigraffle stencils to create network diagrams, E-R diagrams, and flowcharts, for example.\n\nA: I personally like MaSSHandra. The approach of it is a bit different to what MS Visio has as it is a 3D tool and provides other tools like autodiscovery of networks. And it's cross-platform.\n\nA: Check out Napkin.

{"text": "Q: What is the thinking behind pushing the writing area in Pages to the left? For better or for worse, I am so used to Microsoft Word. The page is in the center of the window surrounded by gray. Pages pushes the writing area to the left. Why is this?\nI don't like full screen mode (because I don't like to be fully immersed so as to better grab notes, links, do research, etc), and I don't always like the page thumbnails open. I don't like the window to be any smaller than the whole screen because I don't like seeing the clutter underneath windows. \nWhat's the rationale? Is it just to be 'different' than Word? \n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft Word's Page Layout\n\n*Apple Pages closest attempt to mimic this layout\n\nA: The reasoning behind these kind of differences is what makes OS X different from other OSes. The MS Word behavior you describe was born in (or at least comes from) Windows. The Pages \u201cpage\u201d allows you to resize the window and make the content fit the size, therefore occupying the entire document window. Since you can option+cmd+P to show the pages thumbnails, my guess is that the way Cocoa control works makes more sense if the page is left-aligned. Since under OS X you can only resize a window from the lower right corner, this also means they don\u2019t have to worry about keeping your page visible if you perform a fancy resize from a different place (because you can\u2019t). Lower right means you\u2019ll just be making the visible area smaller, but never really \u201ccovering\u201d part of the horizontal part of the page, and if you do, Pages will make it smaller to a certain degree until it won\u2019t let you make the window smaller (horizontally speaking).\nCould all this be made if the page was in the middle like MS Word? \nPossibly, but it would have looked much worse and the space on the left of the page would have been wasted space. You would also have a \u201cmoving\u201d page when you resize if you had previously  zoomed in in order to accommodate the contents in a proper way. \nIf you keep you document window the size you want to see it, I don\u2019t see why you need the page in the center, since the MS Word border you talk to, is a wasted screen space. If you want to see the text in a more \u201crelative to a real page\u201d thing, you can always use \u201cPage Thumbnails\u201d (and make it bigger) or turn on \u201cShow Layout\u201d shift+cmd+L, but that\u2019s as best as you can get.\nI really never thought about this difference until I read your question, but after using Pages for a couple of years, I can say I like the Pages\u2019 approach better.\nIt\u2019s a matter of window management and operating system differences I guess.\n\nA: The application Isolator might help you, at least a bit. It should allow you to keep the Pages window not maximized but still hide the windows underneath it so you can better focus on Pages.\n\nA: The Microsoft Way =/= the intuitive choice of all humans.  It's just what you're used to if you're used to using Microsoft software.\nIt took me a while to figure out what you guys were even talking about, because I hate seeing that gray wasted space anyway and configure my windows in either program so there isn't any.  The Pages way minimizes this wasted space, though, therefore to me it is better.  (Though I do wish they had something like the Word 'normal' view.)\n\nA: I don't understand your arguments of \"more natural\" and \"simple and logical\" when talking about placing a piece of paper.\nIf I write something, I like to keep the paper on my right side as I write with my left hand.\nI'm not saying this is the only way, I'm just saying that for me it's more natural and more logical to keep the paper closer to my writing hand for less strain and movement of the arm.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2823", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: Wifi shared from Macbook comes and goes I have a new iPod Touch, and an old(er) Mac.  To connect my iPod Touch to the internet at home, I set up my Mac to share its internet connection (ethernet) over wifi.\nI'm running Mac OS X 10.5.8 on an Intel (Core 2 Duo) Mac.  For completeness, the \"sharing\" control panel says:\nShare your connections from: Built-in Ethernet\nTo computers using: (X) Airport\n\nand the Airport Options say:\nNetwork Name: (some name)\nChannel: Automatic\n[X] Enable encryption (using WEP)\nPassword: (some 5-letter word)\nConfirm password: (again)\nWEP Key Length: 40-bit (more compatible)\n\nI used this setup for a couple weeks with no problem at all.  A day or two ago, sometime in the afternoon, it got funny: the connection would work for a few seconds just fine, and then cut out for a few seconds, then come back, etc.  Sometimes I can sit here with my iPod and watch the network status icon at the top of the display come and go.\nIt's not a strength issue: I'm right next to it, and it always shows max bars in the iPod control panel.  It's not a WEP issue, because it accepts my password, and if I turn off WEP entirely it does the same thing.  If I'm in the iPod control panel, it always shows max signal strength for my network -- it just disconnects me regularly, and frequently.  (This is especially annoying if I go into an app like Safari, because it asks me to pick a network and retype my password every 10 seconds.)  It's not an iPod issue, because the wifi still works perfectly on all other wireless networks I use.\nHas anyone seen this before?  I haven't tried rebooting yet because I have a ton of things open.  Is there some way to restart the networking subsystem on Mac OS that might help this?\n\nA: I suggest you restart your box to make sure that it\u2019s just not a problem there. You could technically turn off the AirPort and turn it back on (that\u2019d restart most of the stuff), however the \u201cproblem\u201d could be on the Kernel level, which would only be fixed with a proper restart or even a hardware buffer, which a cold shutdown would most likely fix. \nIn any case, if you still want to experiment, try changing the Channel from Automatic to something you can use in your country and move it, maybe somebody (neighborhood?) brought new devices or networks next to you and that causes new interference that wasn\u2019t there two days ago.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2853", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: What's a good Windows RDP client for Mac? I administer a number of Windows machines, and am trying to find a really good application to remote desktop in to them from my Mac.  I've tried CoRD, and I really like its library approach to saved sessions (as opposed to Microsoft's file based approach), and tabbed sessions are great when working on a bunch of machines.  Unfortunately, it's just too buggy for serious use, and given that it averages less than 2 releases a year, I have little hope that that will change.  Microsoft's official client is very bare bones and doesn't support connecting on non-standard ports (which I need).\nIs there a remote desktop client for Mac out there that's both fully featured and not buggy?\nEdit: Apparently the Microsoft doc I read that states that the Microsoft RDC client can't be used on non-standard ports is out of date.\n\nA: In my experienced opinion, CoRD and Jump Desktop are the best RDP clients for Mac. CoRD is more for those that know what they're doing - it's simple, stable, fast and reliable. Jump Desktop however is for those that are new to Remote Desktop Connections and want something that makes things easy. It's easily the slickest RDP client for Mac too and looks great. There's a useful extensive review of the best RDP clients for Mac here: http://machow2.com/rdp-for-mac/\n\nA: Reading this answer I learned about Royal TSX and after a few hours I'm happy with it.\nIn addition to RDP it has a terminal plugin for SSH/Telnet connections with X forwarding. Mac OS terminal can do the same, but connection documents are handy.\nThe terminal plugin also allows COM port use. I have not tested this but I hope that works OK because I have not found a good terminal program for plain COM port. I still use minicom.\nLicensing terms are generous enough that in my case I can use it for free but I may consider purchasing to encourage the maintenance.\n\nA: Use RDC (Remote Desktop Connection Client for Mac 2)\nThis free download runs natively on both Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macs\nUse One Mac, unlimited Windows.\n\n\nA: The best RDP client for OSX (whether free or not) is Thinomenon RDC. It supports audio, printing, scanning, and most importantly, RemoteApp/RAIL.\n\nA: New Microsoft Remote Desktop 10 supposed to be best RDP client for Mac.\nWorks super smooth btw. \n\nA: Check out Royal TSX if you're after a full featured connections manager that can do RDP as well as other protocols like, VNC, SSH, Telnet, etc.\nhttp://www.royaltsx.com/ts/osx\nDisclaimer: I'm the developer of the mentioned product.\n\nA: I use a program called CoRD.\nIt's worked well for me without fussing with any configuration files or properties.\nIt's been a while since I tried any alternatives, so I'll give RDC another try.\nI don't remember why I rejected it before.\n\nA: If you are willing to spend some money, there is LogMeIn, which I have used for my home Macs with great success. On the free side, we used to use \"Chicken of the VNC\" but decided to go with Microsoft's official client for reasons unknown to me. Six of one half dozen of the other, if you ask me. Frankly, the VNC market is pretty banal.\n\nA: You may want to try iTAP. \nIt seems it does support NLA per the specs. (I only tested TSG, which works fine).  \nIf you come from CoRD, you will find the overall frame quite basic, but the emulation itself seems to work pretty well (I normally work in full screen mode and switch windows with the top menu).\n\nA: Chrome Remote Desktop is cross-platform. \"Provide remote assistance to Windows, Mac and Linux users, or access your Windows (XP and above) and Mac (OS X 10.6 and above) desktops at any time, all from the Chrome browser on virtually any device, including Chromebooks.\"\nUsed LogMeIn til they yanked free utility, Chrome RD works almost as well, but I can't reboot a computer without losing connection completely.  It must then be reconnected locally - AHRRRG.\nSo, still looking for cross-plat solution, too. \n\nA: Since updating  my iMac to El Capitan 10.11.4, CORD Version 0.5.7 (5701) is no longer crashing.\nI've been using it since Tiger. It began crashing intermittently with OSX Yosemite, then would always crash on quitting with El Capitan before 10.11.4, and often crash on changing screen resolution. After 2 days of use, I have no longer seen a crash with OSX 10.11.4.\n\nA: try Teamviewer I am not sure about the multiple tabs for easy switch never had a chance to test it. Also you can set it for lan incoming connection so you can connect via a lan rather than internet.\nYou can create a free account and add all machines to it, So you can even see which system is on and connect with one click \n\nA: Microsoft now has a beta for yet another new RDP client: Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac v8.2.20\nIt still has a variety of problems, but it at least looks more like a MacOSX application.\n\nA: The best RDP client for Mac is Thinomenon. \nI can even run .rdp files from remote apps and work only the application does not show the entire desktop \n\nA: I\u2019m looking for an RDP client to work with Windows on VirtualBox running on my Linux server. The idea is that when I upgrade my Mac with the newer processor, the Linux server can handle the old Intel stuff.\nI tried Microsoft\u2019s RDP client, but window sizing is a real pain, and I really hate the way a window floats around inside the larger RDP window.\nSo far, Jump Desktop is working well, and window resizing is good. It also does for my VNC client. I\u2019ve had a few issues with sessions crashing when adjusting the Windows screen resolution, and have submitted a support request.\n\nA: I use Real VNC.

{"text": "Q: Why does GPS on the iPhone use so much power? I keep reading in articles that GPS on the iPhone, or any cell phone for that matter, uses a lot of power, but I've never heard an explanation of why.\nWhy is this? The phone doesn't have to transmit like it does with 3G or WiFi. \nDoes the actual act of receiving and amplifying the signal take a lot of power?\nOr is it used by the CPU? I find it hard to believe that the computation necessary to process the GPS signal would tax a modern processor. \nSo where does the power drain come from?\n\nA: GPS chips draw about 50 mW at full power (see also here, modern mobile chips draw even less). The antenna does not draw power, that's not how antennas work (I assume the signal amplification and filtering is handled inside the GPS chip. If not, this would add slightly to the power draw). So in 1 hour, the chip draws 50mWh from the battery if at full power. The iPhone battery has a capacity of ~5000 mWh (~1400mAh*3.8V), meaning it could power the chip for 100 hours, if that were the only thing it did. In reality, the chip will not continuously run at full power and it will power down even if GPS is enabled, unless an app is actively requiring GPS tracking - in which case a much higher power draw is caused by the CPU and screen (0.5-1.5W).\n\nA: Some real life measurements, taken with GPS tracking on, offline map used (Galileo app), all other radios off (airplane mode) and power save on.\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone SE, iOS 9 consumes 220 mW average\n\n*iPhone 5s consumes 480 mW average\nfor reference, pre-android, GPS with Trekbuddy\n\n\n*legacy Sonim consumes 700 mW average\n\n\nThis supports the statement above, 50 mW (one quarter) of the power is used for the GPS and the rest for display and other smarts in the phone.\nYou can always burn more power, but that is not because of the GPS, but most likely for loading online maps with poor/marginal mobile data coverage. \n\nA: To obtain a semi precise GPS position, you need at least three satellites (but usually four or more is required to obtain a decent degree of precision) to triangulate your position. The more you have the better the accuracy. \nA GPS receiver needs to power its antenna, and constantly process the signal sent by each satellite. Remember that satellites are continually transmitting messages. (50 bits/sec as far as I can remember)\nSatellites emit messages specifying their exact location, trajectory, speed, the time each message was sent and the rough location of all the other satellites in the constellation.\nBy comparing this info to the time the signal was received a distance from the satellite to the receiver can be determined. When you have three or more satellites you can triangulate your location in three dimensions relative to the positions of the satellites. \nThe iPhone (and other phones) use A-GPS, which is designed to (believe it or not) among other things, make the GPS work better in poor reception areas (cities?) and reduce the amount of information that the receiver needs from the satellites, thus saving battery power from the Antenna.\nThe parts of the GPS signal about location, speed and orbital trajectory usually drop out first when in low reception, that\u2019s where A-GPS fits in, feeding that info for every satellite in that part of the world to the phone, from a central database via the mobile network. Now the phone just has to search for the short timing signals from each satellite, which are easier to receive than the other parts of the transmission. \nWhen all that information is calculated, an algorithm (there are a few as far as I know) is used to compute the position of the actual receiver. \nNow add to that the fact that GPS messages are encoded and that satellites broadcast the messages at about 50 bits per second. And that each message is really a subset of frames with time, position, error correction, etc, etc. \nThere are more factors involver, but for the purpose of making this simple, the GPS\u2019s cpu must constantly use the radio (already power hungry) to capture the signal (which may be weak!) for usually four or more (sometimes up to 20!) satellites that are constantly sending packages, then it must decode and process them, perform calculations to analyze the results and in some cases draw a map or feed an application with the info. \nAs you can see, this sounds easy but it\u2019s not. There\u2019s a lot of CPU processing involved in the back (plus the antenna\u2019s power!)\nSo the GPS power consumption usually comes from the real time nature of the operation. Powering the antenna, listening for information and processing it, uses power, more than just a standby radio antenna (the phone) waiting for a call. Plus the A-GPS uses also the phone\u2019s radio and (if available) Wi-Fi networks to determine its location (and use less GPS info), which means, more power is used at the same time.\nThe Wikipedia GPS page has a lot of detailed information if you want to get the specifics and/or dive into more GPS geekery, including the math and error correction stuff.\n\nA: Although Martin's answer has tons of great information, I'm going to add an answer that differs on several key points as I don't feel comfortable editing his article to change it substantially.\nIn a nutshell, the CPU takes the power and the GPS keeps the CPU from sleeping. Furthermore, with background location updates, apps can now enter low power state even while geo fencing and remote recording is enabled so that the app can wake itself up periodically to get more accurate fixes without keeping the CPU+GPS circuitry active for hours on end. By triggering a high accuracy GPS fix once every 15 to 45 minutes while hiking is far more energy efficient than needing constant location updates which is what the OS changes now allow. \nYes, the GPS antenna circuitry does take some additional power to do the timing calculations and spit out a location but since the antenna is receive only and no signal needs to be amplified, this power drain is more of a rounding error than the cause of high power consumption. The signal processing and complicated math to spit out location, probable error and speed vectors is done in the GPS silicon chip and not the CPU of the phone. \nAll portable GPS units have to receive and process the GPS antenna signals - so that power usage is likely to be similar across all devices using modern GPS chipsets. Also the energy of two AA batteries is 4.2 WHr which compares very well to iPhone 3 and 4 battery capacities. Thus the big difference in run times between say a Garmin and an iPhone is the app that uses the data runs a much more power hungry iPhone CPU and screen. \nHaving an app in the foreground constantly processing GPS data (or in the background but sleeping very much less than normal) is what makes the iPhone use battery energy so much faster than a single purpose GPS unit. (whose screen and CPU use much less power and sleep far more of the time than the iPhone does)\nA poorly designed iPhone app that is constantly checking and sending / receiving data to report a location or react to the latest new data will use more energy than you might expect. A well designed app that needs to be running all the time will similarly drain the battery of most iPhones in 3 to 5 hours.\nIf the iPhone is transmitting data or searching for faint cell signals - that circuitry will be on it's highest consumption level. Hiking out of cell coverage is a \"double whammy\" of the cell modem transmitting on high power to talk to a distant tower or search for coverage at the same time GPS location data is preventing the CPU from sleeping as often.

What I notice that I am unable to go online - I cannot check my email, browse the web, etc. My guess is that my wireless router's DHCP tables have recycled (or whatever the right word is) and that the iPod Touch needs to renew its IP address.\nIf I go to the iPod Touch's Settings it lists my network and the DHCP-granted IP address, DNS settings, and so forth. If I try to renew the lease the existing settings are erased and the iPod thinks for a while before bringing up a new IP address. However, this new one starts with 169.254 (or something like that) when it should start with 192.168. Needless to say, the connectivity problems persist.\nThe only way I can get back online is to power down the iPod Touch then power it back on, which takes upwards of a minute. Is this a known problem with the iPod Touch? Is it an issue with my router? Am I stuck rebooting the iPod Touch when this situation unfolds?\nThanks!\n\nA: Numbers starting with 169... are self assigned numbers and means the iPhone can't find a DHCP server to connect to.\nThis used to happen to my iPhone on an earlier OS version (3 point something). I haven't seen it for a while. Switching to and from \"Airplane Mode\" was enough to get the iPhone to acquire a new address.\nPS.

{"text": "Q: Has anyone experienced ergonomic problems with the Magic Mouse? I used a Magic Mouse for the past few months. Very soon after I started using it I developed some aching in my hand. Over time this has grown to be more or less constant, even when not using the mouse for a while. I just switched back to an old bulky Logitech mouse, and just resting my hand on it feels much better. The Magic Mouse seems way too flat to be comfortable for prolonged use.\nI know this is a rather subjective question, but have other people experienced similar ergonomic problems with the Magic Mouse? Is there any study about it?\n\nA: Probably does.\nWhich is why I picked up the Magic Mouse Fix. Worked excellent.\nThen I got the Magic Trackpad and realized why I hate mice.\n\nA: I have serious pain in the base of my thumb because of this device. I will try the trackpad and if that doesn't take care of it, I'll be switching to a Microsoft mouse.\n\nA: You're seeing some first indications of RSI because you're using your hand in ways you're not used to, and possibly because the mouse doesn't fit your hand. \nSwitching to a normal mouse is a good first aid, especially since you noticed that the problem disappeared or became less of a problem. For some people, it just takes time to get used to new movements, while others won't be able to use the new device for longer periods of time. Those unlucky people should not force themselves to use devices that aren't comfortable for them, and this might include you.\nThe problem with the magic mouse, IMHO, is that it's too small to really be useful as a gesture device because you're gesturing with the same hand that you use to hold it. That's bound to be awkward, which stresses your hand's anatomy, and some people develop problems from that. Others might not notice any problems -- everybody is different.\nSolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change to a different mouse.\n\n*If you must use gesture input, use a separate device for that. Apple offers the magic touchpad, which is a simpler and smaller version of the original FingerWorks iGesture series of devices which you can still buy used on eBay. And their laptops have multitouch trackpads too.\n\n\nA: I own a Magic Mouse but don't use it regularly. I haven't notice any aching in my hand. I know another person who suffers from RSI and uses it with his left hand instead of his right. No problem too. \n\nA: I would suggest using 3M Ergonomic Mouse.  It works best for me and many programmers/hackers I know.\n\n\nA: I've had a magic mouse for just over a week (as part of a new iMac) and have started feeling RSI type pain in my hand just below the fingers after prolonged use (ie., constant use for 30mins or more). I've never had any pain from the 25 years of using a normal mouse on a daily basis.\nI purchased Apple Care with my new Mac and have contacted Apple about this issue today. Their response was; \"This is the first we have heard of this.\" Despite lots of complaints on the internet about ergonomic problems of the magic mouse, apparently I am the first person to advise Apple direct of this!! Hmmm, i don't think so.\nTheir solution - buy a Track Pad, or buy a USB Logitech mouse. \nShocking. I would've expected better from Apple.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2885", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "14"}}

{"text": "Q: Safari is using too much RAM. How can I reduce its memory footprint? I'm finding Safari (Latest - v5.0.2) to be even more of a memory hog than usual.  (Currently using 465mb of RAM with only this tab open, but having been running for a while)  \nClosing it and reopening it lowers it's memory footprint, but it always creeps back up over time.\nAside from disabling extensions, any tips to help troubleshoot/reduce it's memory usage?  I've been using ClickToFlash which helps by requiring any Flash entity to be manually enabled on each page view.\n\nA: This is just a fact of life using Safari. Spend some time browsing Flickr and it's memory usage will go way over a Gig. Gmail is another killer.\nI think Safari most be doing aggressive in memory caching to speed things up.\n\nA: There's nothing wrong with turning off flash, but the main advantage is lower processor usage, not just memory consumption (though it's great to see turning it off has lowered Safari's footprint). \nI don't think you need to worry about what Safari is doing with memory for a couple of reasons:\nSafari 5 is a 64bit application, where as Firefox and Google Chrome are only 32bit (at least the mac public releases). This is relevant because 64bit applications appear to use more memory while they're running (The Growl team explains this better than I could, here). \nIf you've got free memory, which the OS (and Safari) can release quickly, safely and easily (speaking as a Programmer), why not use it to cache your web content - that's what it's there for. Trust your OS - it's clever, if another application needs the memory it'll just release the not-needed-right-now-bits-and-bobs. \nSafari also has an unfair advantage- it's made by the same company that built your computer. I'm not saying Safari is infallible, or even that it's the best browser, just that you shouldn't over-think the statistics; memory is there to be used and if it's not negatively affecting your computing experience then don't stress.  \n\nA: using Safari 5.0.5, I have flash turned off and in running sunspider 0.91 I'm seeing real mem growth to over 1.73GB on a 4GB mac mini (2010), and CPU over 100%.  It runs so slow it doesn't complete in over 10 minutes.\nRunning the same in Firefox 5.0 (also 64bit) I'm getting 500mb of real memory 90% CPU, and it completes in less than 30 seconds (and is reporting 300ms as a score... spiffy!).\nSo my answer is... stop using safari on snow leopard and move to firefox 5.0.\n\nA: So it appears that Flash is still the main culprit - if you enable any flash in ClickToFlash it stays resident in memory.\nFollowing Gruber's advice on Daring Fireball, I've disabled Flash entirely on all browsers except Chrome and this seems to have helped immensely\n\nA: You can disable cache in developer toolbar (right click-> inspect element), \"network\" tab, on the right side of the opened pane. When you hover the element it says \"Disable/Ignore cached ressource while loading resource\".\nOnce it is red, velvet cache are deactivated and memory consumption is far lower after that. \nYou also have to empty the cache by activating developer mode, open menu \"developer\" -> \"empty cache\" and you will see a huge drop in RAM consumed by Safari.\nThere is also another major factor of performance drop : Virtual Memory (swap file). If a process start using it heavily (WindowServer), you will see a huge drop in computer performance because read/write access to disk is monopolized by these processes, leaving little room to other processes for disk access operations. \nI suspect Catalina to be buggy in that regard as I saw a huge drop in performance after updating due to excessive Virtual Memory usage, reaching as high as 250Mo/s of writing access and 200MB/s of reading access for a SSD.\nYou can try to disable Virtual Memory, if (and only if) you have enough RAM (>=16GB) with this command :\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\nIf you run into issues after that, like sudden self-awareness making your mac unresponsive or excessive RAM usage, enable Virtual Memory again with :\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2910", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "13"}}

I don't like viewing PDFs in the browser (even though I know this is possible), but prefer to have the pdf download and be viewed in Preview.\nWhen I click the link in Chrome it asks me where I want the file saved, and then it downloads it. I click on the completed download tab at the bottom of the screen, and Chrome remains in the foreground. I can see that Preview has indeed been opened and the PDF is viewable, but I have to switch to Preview to view it using expose or command-tab.\nOnce the document has been opened in Preview and even when Preview is quit out of, it will always open Preview up in the foreground. This only happens on the first instance of opening a document. Also, if Preview is already open (in fore or background) downloading a new document will bring it to the foreground. So, what's happening only happens when a new document is downloaded and preview is not executed.\nHere's what I would like to have happen:\nI want to click on the completed download in the Chrome download bar at the bottom, and have it open and Preview and application-switch directly to Preview so that Preview is the foreground active application.

Aside from the actual keeping of history, you can save snippets that you use often and call them up with a combination of letters and search among recently copied texts. Alfred's interface for this is much nicer than Jumpcut's in my opinion. I haven't tried any of the others.

{"text": "Q: How well does the Apple Magic Trackpad perform as a mouse replacement? I'm planning to replace my mouse entirely with the Apple Magic Trackpad on my desktop Mac. My work involves lots of typing (both code and prose). I also use Aperture quite a bit for processing photos. I don't play games; other than chess (Yes, it's that sad.)\nIs the Apple Magic Trackpad capable of totally replacing the mouse?\nHow does its ergonomics compare to let's say the Apple Magic Mouse? Better or worse for the wrist.\nIs it accurate enough for touching up photos with Aperture?\nThanks.\n\nA: I've found the trackpad to be great for general purpose use (particularly the 3-finger swipe-to-drag gesture and the wonderful inertial scrolling) but I've found it too inaccurate for GUI development work. \nWhen I'm laying out screens for software development, or creating graphics for said software, it's too awkward to exactly position things with. I suspect you will find a similar problem if you are touching-up images etc.\nI've found the ergonomics to be good, to be honest - I mostly use the Magic Trackpad and when that's not suitable for a job (see above) I switch to a Magic Mouse for a couple of hours. I have relatively small hands and find the Magic Mouse to be a really comfortable mouse, with no strain on fingers or wrist even after prolonged use. The trackpad gives you less to 'lean on' but I haven't found myself with any wrist ache or strain even when I've been using it solid for a day, etc.\n\nA: The Magic Trackpad is very similar to the trackpad found on newer Apple MacBooks. It is suitable for most kinds of work. Though it is capable of completely replacing a mouse in function, it is much less adequate, and perhaps even irritating, to use with image editing programs such as Aperture. The wrist motion is in large the same.\n\nA: EDIT: Summary of my answer: It does not perform very well as a replacement for a mouse.\nYmmv I guess. I got into the hype as well, bought it, and eventually put it back into its box and considering selling it on eBay. I'm not wholly disappointed with it, but on 27 inch iMac, I found it to be significantly slower for pretty much any kind of operations, compared to a mouse.\nLike you, I was very excited when I heard about it, because I had gotten used to the trackpad on a Macbook Pro during a long holiday. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it doesn't translate well on a large screen. On a desktop computer, you expect to have more control than on a laptop. You have more keys, more space. So no, the Magic Trackpad is not a replacement for a mouse, at least not on a 27 inch screen. \nWhat I did like on the trackpad, mostly, was the ability to scroll pages in the browser with the double finger swipe. Task switching with the trackpad was always awkward.\nSince I still felt I needed a mouse, I also unwrapped the bluetooth keyboard that came with the iMac, and put the trackpad next to it. That way it took approximately the same space as my aluminium keyboard. Unfortunately I found I had more strain in the wrist because I needed to move the arm between the trackpad and the mouse, and using a cushion under the arm moving sideways from time to time didn't work well. Now that is my opinion as well, but I didn't enjoy the wireless keyboard; it felt cheap and light compared to the aluminium keyboard. Typing on the wired aluminium keyboard felt a lot better. Since it was rather cumbersome to try to fit the trackpad in between a large Aluminium keyboard (comes with keypad) and the mouse, I moved the wireless keyboard and magic trackpad back into their boxes :(\nThat is my honest opinion. I love Macs. I think the Magic Trackpad is a great idea. I even tried gaming with it. I still wish it worked. But it doesn't. It works better in a few ways, but it can not match the prevision and speed of a mouse.\nFor a web developer who needs to switch tabs, click small things in the window, toggle the Firebug console and all its panels every now and then, switch between gaezillions of windows; it doesn't work.\nPerhaps it is still a good choice for people who do primarily typing and editing documents.\nThis, for me, would be the perfect aluminium keyboard:\n\nThis is not a joke. If that space was used as a trackpad, it would be so convenient to do the swipe gestures for scrolling down webpages. I guess it would be just as useful for most other gestures. Unless you are a hardcore \"the vim way\" user, like me you will often use the cursor keys. Since the hand often ends up there, and the home/end/pgup/pgwn keys are hardly necessary on a Mac (think Cmd-Left, Cmd-Right, etc), this just makes sense.\n\nA: I mostly use my Mac to write code and have found the Magic Trackpad to be very well suited for this task. The main drawback is drag and drop can be a little awkward - however, its usually possible to find ways around drag and drop in most interfaces.\n\nA: I can't say I've used the Magic Trackpad, but if you're looking for some of the touch gestures and scroll inertia (which I love), while keeping the accuracy of a mouse, I'd go for the Magic Mouse.  I've been using mine since they were first released and it's served me very well in everything from image editing to web browsing to programming (can't say enough about how much I love the inertial scroll for getting around large documents...)\nThe one downside to the Magic Mouse (again, can't say if this also applies to the Magic Trackpad) is that it burns through batteries.  Each set of 2 AAs usually lasts me about 2.5 months.  For this reason, I also picked up Apple's rechargeable battery set (6 AAs & wall-mounted charger).  That was about 2 months ago, and I've been happy with the charger set as well.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2973", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}

You can have multiple versions of OS X on one machine, but you can only install newer versions than the one that came pre-installed. For example, if your machine came with 10.6.4, you can't run 10.6.3 or older.\nWhen Apple releases new hardware, the drivers for that hardware get rolled into a special build of OS X that comes only on that model. They don't get added to OS X in general until the next point release. (That means that drivers for the hypothetical machine I'm talking about wouldn't be added until 10.6.5.)\nApple doesn't release drivers as standalone software, which effectively makes it impossible to install and older version of OS X than what your Mac shipped with. You'll find that if you put the install disc for an older version in the drive, it either won't boot or it will refuse to install.\nHowever, you can go the other direction. If you have an old Mac running 10.5, you can use Disk Utility to make another partition (HFS+ Journaled), then boot the install DVD for 10.6 and install it to that partition. To switch between the two after installing, hold alt when you boot up. (You can also select the default boot partition through the Startup Drive pane in System Preferences within either OS X install.) Boot camp is not required for this. Boot camp is only required for installing non-Apple operating systems like Windows and Linux.\n\nA: I would think partitioning the disk and using Boot Camp is all you need to do here.\nIf you don't have a 10.5 disk already, then you'll need to go through Ebay and sites of its ilk.

Does it really close applications, or does it just display the home page and an extra thread runs in the background? Is there any way that I can see the currently running applications?\n\nA: In iOS 3, you press the home button, with very few and only Apple-engineered exceptions (eg. the iPod app) the app is closed.\nIn iOS 4+, there is limited multitasking available to third-party apps. Apple freezes all processes in the background unless they're performing one of the following functions (ripped from Ars):\n\n\n*\n\n*Audio: you can now listen to streaming music from apps, like Pandora or newscasts through the NPR app, while doing other activities on your phone.\n\n*VoIP: you can carry on Voice Over IP calls on services like Skype without having to quit the app if you need to perform other tasks.\n\n*Location: apps that need to poll your location, such as GPS and direction apps, will be able to do so in the background.\n\n*Local notifications: third-party apps no longer have to rely solely on push notifications if they want to alert you of something on your phone. If you have an alert set in, say, one of Omni's applications, it can ping you when the time comes instead of having to go through a convoluted series of Internet tubes to get to you.\n\n*Complete tasks: if you start a task in an application and then switch to another one (such as downloading a new map in your favorite game), it can now complete the task in the background instead of forcing you to sit there and wait on it.\n\n*Fast app switching: this is basically \"pausing\" an app where it is, which allows you to quickly switch away from it and then switch back, picking up where you left off.\n\n\nIn iOS 4, double-tapping the home button shows a tray holding both recently-used apps and apps performing the above limited-multitasking functions. You can close them/remove them from the tray by clicking the red \"-\" sign.\n\nA: If you use iOS 4 (or higher) tapping the Home button to close an app now only hides the app's activity and don't closed really, if you want close app you must \"double tap button hold the icon then press the dash to close it\"\nBut if you use iOS 3 or less when you press ipod touch button it close running apps and go to your home page.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2983", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: What's the difference between alias and link? I see that the size of alias is 167.7kB, whereas symbolic link is just 4kB. \n\n\n*\n\n*What's the difference between the two, or what's the purpose of them?\n\n*Which one is preferable? For the case that the link/alias is used only in one machine or networked.\n\n\nADDED\nhttp://prosseek.blogspot.com/2012/12/symbolic-link-and-alias-in-mac.html\n\nA: I'm quite confused by sentinel's anwser on create a new file with the path and filename that the file originally had. Also it's abrupt, why you want to do that?\nWell, if you understand why and how alias works on using UID and path to the file (while symlink only works on the path), then you can understand the difference and the highly-voted answer more easily.\n\nOn HFS and HFS+ file systems, each file and folder has a unique, persistent identifier. Aliases use this identity along with pathname information to find files and folders on the same volume.\nBeginning with Mac OS X 10.2, aliases reversed this search order by using the pathname first and unique identity second. This means that if you move a file and replace it with an identically named file, aliases to the original file now point to the new file. Similarly, if you move a file on the same volume (without replacing it), aliases use the unique identity information to locate the file.\nWhen a file or folder moves, the alias may update either its path information or unique identity information to account for the change. If a file moves somewhere on the same volume, the alias updates its internal record with the new path information for the file. Similarly, if the original file is replaced by a file with the same name, but a different unique identity, the alias updates its internal record with the unique identity of the new file. (result of create a new file with the path and filename that the file originally had)\nBecause aliases use a file system path to resolve a files location initially, they now offer a similar behavior to symbolic links. Symbolic links rely exclusively on path information to locate a file. If you move a file somewhere on the same volume without replacing it, symbolic links to the file break while aliases do not. The only way to fix a symbolic link is to delete it and create a new one.\n\nreference\n\nA: An alias contains two pieces of information: a unique identifier of the file it links to, and the path and file name of the file it links to.\nIf you rename or move a file, and then create a new file with the path and file name that the file originally had, then any alias that linked to the original file now links to the new file.\nHowever, if you rename or move a file without replacing it, and then invoke an alias, the alias is updated to point to the new path and file name, making use of the unique identifier to do so.\nA symbolic link, on the other hand, does not contain a unique identifier to a file, and would appear as broken if the file is renamed or moved and not replaced with a file of the same path and file name.\nYour choice should depend on which scenario suits you best.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2991", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "27"}}

{"text": "Q: How to download an MP3 to an iPod Touch? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to download free music from the internet to itunes on the iphone/ipad without using a mac/pc? \n\nI have a new (4gen) iPod Touch.  There's an MP3 on the web that I want to download so I can listen to it when there's no wifi available.\nI can figure out how to play it, but I can't figure out how to download it (i.e., save it for future listening).  It seems like iTunes is the only way to download audio or video, and it only has a preset list of things that can be downloaded (and a poor search feature!).\nDo I need to download it on my Mac, and then sync, just to download an MP3?\n\nA: You answered your self. You must download the file on your Mac and then you must sync it to your iPod Touch!\n\nA: If you can get yourself a direct link to the MP3 file through Safari, your best bet is GoodReader or something like it.\nYou can put a URL into this app and it will actually download the file to the app's allocated document storage space on your iOS device. It won't add the song to your iTunes library or the Music section of your iPod, but you'll at least be able to play the file offline by opening the GoodReader app and browsing to it.\nThe nice thing about this is that when you get back to your Mac, you can plug in your iPod, copy the MP3 from GoodReader's document storage (through iTunes) to your hard drive, and then add it to your iTunes music library \"the right way\", so it'll sync into your iPod's Music section from now on.\n\nA: If the MP3 isn't trapped in a Flash or Silverlight player, this will work:\nIn Safari, go to Window -> Activity in the menu bar. In the Activity window, you'll see a list of each page you currently have open. Find the one your MP3 is on and look through the listed files. The list shows every file on the currently open pages.\nSelect the address for the MP3 and press Command (Apple key) and C at the same time to copy the address. (This part is the tricky part. If the page it's on has a lot of other files, it can sometimes be difficult to identify the right one.)\nNow go to Window -> Downloads and press Command and V to paste the address into the download window. This should cause the file you selected to download to your default location for Downloads (usually the Downloads folder within your home folder).\nOnce it's in your Downloads folder, you can just drag it into iTunes.

{"text": "Q: Best practices for a backup and fresh install I try to keep my mid-2009 Macbook Pro (5,3) pretty clean but over the last year I have definitely felt things slowing down a bit. I'm anxious to do a fresh install but I want to make sure I have a backup of everything at least, but an easy restore procedure would be best. I have files that aren't in the standard home folder locations, so I want to make sure I get everything.\nWhat are your best practices for backing up before a fresh install?\n\nA: (Option #1)\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! (yes, with an \u2018!\u2019).\n\n*Get an external Firewire or USB2 Drive that has the same or bigger size than your current drive.\n\n*Using either of the above programs, make a perfect clone of your entire Old hard drive. \n\n*Boot using the image in the New drive to make sure it works (either program will explain how to do that, it\u2019s just pressing a key at startup).\n\n*Once you\u2019re sure your new drive boots and all your information is there, shutdown the computer, disconnect the new drive and store it in a safe location.\n\n*Proceed to format and reinstall your computer with your OS X DVD.\n\n*At the end of the install, decide whether you want to transfer all your information automatically using migration assistant (usually a good idea, but if there\u2019s something \u201cbad\u201d with your profile, it will likely be copied over again, however this time the operating system will be fresh and you can always create a new user and manually replicate things). If you go this route, you\u2019ll need to connect your New drive so Migration Assistant can pull the data (it won\u2019t alter the New drive, it will read it only).\n\n*(Optionally) Do not transfer any settings with Migration assistant and do it Manually after the install is over. This is good if you have problems in your profile, but it\u2019s a tedious work if you had years of \u201cstuff\u201d. You can have Migration Assistant to only transfer your documents (to save you the trouble later), but if you transfer your \u201cNetwork Settings\u201d and your \u201cApplications\u201d any problem you had in the past may \u201ccome back\u201d in those two. You can always manually drag the apps from new drive to Old drive after the install. And unless you also drag their ~Library/Application Settings stuff, they will be \u201cbrand new and unconfigured\u201d. I believe you get the idea.\n\n\n(Option #2)\n\n\n*\n\n*Do the same thing as Option #1, except that instead of making a clone (and booting from it), perform a full Time Machine backup to that new external drive. \n\n*Once you have the backup continue with step number 6 up there. Remember that Migration Assistant will have to be told to \u201cmigrate from a Time Machine backup\u201d instead of \u201cjust another volume\u201d.\nWhich one is better? \nThere\u2019s no better or worse, but a few things must be observed:\n\n\n*\n\n*A full clone, although may seem tedious, it\u2019s a fully working volume that\u2019s identical (well, almost) than your original one, it boots, you can even work from there in case of hard drive failure, in no time you have your computer back. That\u2019s priceless in some environments and under certain circumstances. The clones can later (daily, hourly, etc.) be updated and it takes a fraction of a second to update (just like Time Machine doesn\u2019t make a full backup every time). SuperDuper is very good at that and was a pioneer at doing it right and fast\u2122. \n\n*A Time Machine, although a very nice and handy thing (and I do recommend you also have one once you have your working machine reinstalled and migrated), is not bootable and in case of total hard drive failure, you wouldn\u2019t be able to start working immediately, because Time Machine backups are not bootable and the recovery process is somewhat slower and more prone to errors (in my humble experience).\n\n*With that being said, Time Machine wins hands down when you \u201cneed to find that file I had on my desktop a couple of weeks ago\u201d. Since Full Clones (and their incremental stuff) usually do not keep history of changes (CCC has some stuff about that, but the space used grows really fast), then you always have the \u201clatest\u201d copy of your drive, but you cannot go back to your drive the way it was \u201ca month ago\u201d.\n\n\nSo there you have the two main methods. \nAn ideally backup plan (without going paranoid), will consists of a weekly (or daily) clone/snapshot to a bootable drive that you can store a few feet away from your computer every now and then and an \u201call the time\u201d Time Machine drive sitting there, keeping your computer\u2019s changes up to date in a short interval. This covers the two main problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*I need last week\u2019s file and I need it now! (Time Machine)\n\n*My Drive crashed but I need to continue working now! (Clone)\n\n\nGood Luck! :) \n\nA: Ideal procedure: replace your hard disk with a new hard disk and keep the old one.\nHard disks have a limited lifespan and are expected to wear out eventually.\nYou can choose to place your old hard disk in a casing so that you can connect it to your Mac via USB and even boot from the old hard disk when connected in this way. This offers seamless transition between your new and old computer states, a great way to make sure you have a backup of everything you need, and an effective measure to make sure your hard drive won't crash anytime soon. Your current hard disk is relatively new though, and probably won't crash very soon, but if you're willing to start afresh, I strongly recommend this method.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3045", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: Has anyone else seen \"iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it\"? Just now, upon taking my iPhone 4 out of my pocket where it lives, I was faced with a screen saying \"iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it\" (see below - screenshot mysteriously still worked). The only thing it would let me do was dial emergency calls. The phone was not noticeably any warmer than usual when idle. Are there any known issues with this?\n\n\nA: This happened to my brother's iPhone 4 a few times. When he took it to the Apple Store, they ran a special diagnostic that revealed the phone had reached 200 degrees inside. Needless to say, the phone was replaced.\n\nA: From the User's Guide:\n\nIf the interior temperature of iPhone exceeds normal operating temperatures, you may experience the following as it attempts to regulate its temperature:  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*iPhone stops charging  \n  \n*display dims  \n  \n*weak cellular signal   \n  \n*temperature warning screen appears  \n  \n  \n  Important: You cannot use iPhone while the temperature warning screen is displayed except to make an emergency call. If none of the above measures succeeds in lowering the internal temperature, iPhone automatically goes into a deep sleep mode until it cools. You cannot make an emergency call when iPhone is in this mode. Move iPhone to a cooler location and wait a few minutes before trying to use iPhone again.\n\nThere have been numerous cases of all sorts of consumer electronics melting/exploding, and these have often been settled with lawsuits. It is appropriate that the iPhone take preemptive measures to avoid such accidents. \n\nA: This is a long shot but maybe there's a process going on in the background that's using a lot of processor cycles.\nConsider double clicking the home button and quitting everything running and shutting the iPhone down, then restarting it.\nConsider turning off bluetooth to see if that's an issue.\n\nA: I left my IPhone in car's passenger seat while cleaning garage and had the same message when I retrieved the phone.

{"text": "Q: Replacing SuperDrive with secondary storage? I'm familiar with the OWC Data Doubler, a kit which allows you to remove your Macbook's SuperDrive and replace it with secondary storage.\nWhat alternatives exist for this product?\nA complete answer might explain the pros/cons to removing the SuperDrive as well as tips for proceeding.\n\nA: I can only give you an overview of my own personal experience with the process and hardware I used.  Alot of this is copy pasted from my posts on the thread related to this on macrumors.com.  Here goes:\nI bought the ebay optical bay caddy linked here. Works great. Depending on your model, I would recommend using the \"Optical Drive Replacement\" guide on ifixit.com (here is the link to my particular model, the mid-2010 15in).  Once you remove the drive, you have to do a bit of ad-lib in order to install the caddy.\nThe only issue with this caddy is that two screw holes on the outside facing part of the macbook case do not have a matching hole on the caddy. So the caddy is held in place by one screw on the innermost side. The screw hole that DOES exist on the caddy is actually not part of the caddy at all. You remove a little bracket from the superdrive and use the 2 screws it was secured with to attach it to the caddy in the same position.\nIt seemed pretty wobbly to me so I just took 3 pieces of electrical tape, folded each one on top of itself once, and stuffed them into the spaces where the caddy had wiggle room between the other components and parts of the case. Problem solved... the enclosure doesn't move one bit inside the case. I think it might even dampen the noise a bit since it keeps the metal from contacting other metal bits.\nSo, the important bits about the superdrive replacement:\n\n*\n\n*BACKUP YOUR DATA: probably the most important thing you can do before attempting this procedure\n\n\n*If possible move your User's directory to a separate volume before doing the upgrade:  this will make it easier to clone your data later on... for specifics see my question here\n\n\n*Follow an ifixit guide step by step and label your screws: i used one of those 2 week pill boxes and put labels on the days that corresponded the step number\n\n\n*use good screwdrivers:  I highly recommend the ifixit bit driver set as they all fit correctly and lessen the chance you will cause damage or strip your screws\n\n\n*put your boot drive in the original HDD spot: otherwise you may have issues with sleep and hibernation\n\n\n*make a bootable copy of your installation discs: put the OSX install DVD on a thumb drive or a partition so that you'll be able to boot from it in an emergency without reinstalling the SuperDrive (it may be possible to boot from the superdrive externally but I haven't tested this)\n\n\n*for info regarding installing your superdrive in an external enclosure, check out my answer to this question\nPROS\n\n*\n\n*You have the option of drastically increasing your storage space or using a SSD to dramatically speed up your OS X experience.\n\n\n*My system boots from the SSD in about 15 seconds including 3 programs launching and about 7 or 8 menubar apps\n\n\n*All of my data is located on my original 500GB HDD and is separated from my boot volume in case of OS or disk failure\n\n\n*did i mention it's lightning fast?? :P\nCONS\n\n*\n\n*have to cart around an external superdrive enclosure if you want to use cds or dvds\n\n\n*a HDD in the caddy is definitely noisier than a HDD in the original slot.  I have a feeling this could be mitigated by some noise dampening but I haven't really worried about it too much\n\n\n*you're pulling apart your MacBook so there is always some risk that you'll break something through user error\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3063", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "14"}}
{"text": "Q: Automatically quit Terminal when typing exit Scenario\nI use terminal to SSH a lot, however would like the Terminal App to quit when the last Tab closes using exit. I already have the terminal window itself set to close on successful exit, however Terminal keeps running. I followed Ricky Campbell's tutorial here which uses an AppleScript to quit terminal. The AppleScript works perfectly when running outside of Terminal, however I somehow can't get the trap command to work that needs to be placed in the terminal.\nFor reference I will post the relevant text here:\n\nNow we need a way to kickoff the script. This can be done with the bash command \u201ctrap\u201d, having it listen for the EXIT signal. Since I want this to happen everytime my user opens a shell, I add it to my .profile file. I do this with nano:\n$ nano ~/.profile\nIn this file add the following somewhere. You may need to edit the path to the AppleScript file you created earlier:\ntrap '/usr/bin/osascript $HOME/Scripts/QuitTerminal.scpt' EXIT\nAll this does is listen for the EXIT signal within bash and when it gets it, runs the script we created earlier.\n\nQuestion\nHow do I go about troubleshooting this problem. For some reason the trap is not firing or working the way it should, even after numerous reboots. Is there an alternative way to get the Terminal App to close when the last tab exits?\nSolution\nThe links provided by Dori led to the solution. The article suggest that the trap command should be in .profile, when in fact it has to be placed in .bashrc. Moving it to the correct script fixed the problem.\n\nA: The approach given here looks a little simpler\u2014maybe it would work for you?\n\nIf you don't want to remember to type \"quit\" instead of \"exit\", and you're using bash, just add the following to your .bashrc or other shell startup script:\ntrap '/usr/bin/osascript -e \"tell application \\\"terminal\\\" to quit\"' 0\n\nWhat's it do? When the shell receives signal 0 (zero), that is, told to exit, it will execute this command as the last thing it does. This allows your shell, etc, to exit gracefully, and asking Terminal.app to exit via applescript makes sure it does the same. In other words, type 'exit', and your shell exits, then Terminal quits, all cleanly and the way nature intended.\n\nThe full thread can be found here.\n\nA: You can also use this convoluted command, which does not trigger a warning about terminating its own process:\nosascript -e \"do shell script \\\"osascript -e \\\\\\\"tell application \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Terminal\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to quit\\\\\\\" &> /dev/null &\\\"\"; exit\n\nOr, you could define an alias (such as quit or exit) in your profile:\nalias quit='osascript -e \"do shell script \\\"osascript -e \\\\\\\"tell application \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Terminal\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to quit\\\\\\\" &> /dev/null &\\\"\"; exit'\n\n\nA: You does not need trap any signal.\nSimply, put the osascript command into your ~/.bash_logout file (create it, if does not exists)\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"Terminal\\\" to quit\"\n\nThe .bash_logout is executed by bash after you logging out. You can enter any shell command into this file, each will executed when you logging out. \nFor example, you can open a Finder window in the folder where you was last, before exit, with open . or like...\nopen .\nsay \"Good bye, my master - leaving terminal now, continue with Finder\"\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"Terminal\\\" to quit\"\n\nand so on...\n\nA: I find this url for multi tabed Terminal case. \nhttp://cyberdork33.wordpress.com/2010/05/25/make-osx-terminal-quit-when-last-window-closed/\njust tested on os x 10.8.2\nTL.DR:\nfor the tab part(exit to close current tab)\nTerminal > Preferences > Settings > Shell\nWhen the shell exits: Close if the shell exited cleanly (or Close the window)\nPrompt before closing:  Never(or Only if there are processes other than the logins shell and: Insert \"osascript\")\nfor the last tab part(exit to close this last tab and whole terminal windows and quit Terminal.app):\n1) append to ~/.bash_profile:  \ntrap '/usr/bin/osascript $HOME/Scripts/QuitTerminal.scpt' EXIT\n\n2) create Scripts/QuitTerminal.scpt\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    # If there is only one tab remaining, and it contains the word \"logout\"\n    # then this is the final window\n    if (count of (tabs of (every window whose visible is true))) = 1 then\n        try\n            set theContents to words of ((contents of tab 1 of window 1) as Unicode text)\n            set exitLastTab to (theContents contains \"logout\")\n        on error\n            set exitLastTab to false\n        end try\n\n        if exitLastTab is true then\n            quit\n        end if\n\n    else if (count of (tabs of (every window whose visible is true))) < 1 then\n        # If no window remains open, then obviously we can quit the app.\n        # This would occur when the final window is closed without 'exit'\n        quit\n    end if\nend tell\n\nHope it helps.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3066", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: Audio book just becomes silent on iPhone after a few hours, no issue with desktop player I built an Audio Book (an M4B) file from a set of MP3 files. The result lasts 18h30, and was encoded using Free MP3 to Audio Book Converter. The resulting file uses AAC version 4 - LC - SBR.\nWhen reading this file with Windows Media Player, I encounter no issue.  But on the iPhone (a 3GS running iOS 4.0.1), the sound just abruptly stops at after a few hours (approx. 5 hours), always at the same place: the player still plays the file, but it emits no sound.

{"text": "Q: What would it take to make an iPad support multiple user accounts? As a mobile computer, the iPad is very personal, but it also begs to be shared. And that's a problem. I don't want my friends to be able to check my emails or delete my high score when they play with it.\nBeing based on OS X, iOS could theoretically support multiple user accounts. But adding new users (even if done correctly) wouldn't play nice with iTunes.\nSo, what about partitioning the hard drive and installing several instances of iOS? Add a screen early in the boot process that allows you to choose the partition, and thus the user.\nItunes would thus be able to sync many users separately on the same device, depending on the chosen partition.\nTo be clearer: I'm not just asking the question, I want to actually do it. Can anybody suggest means to achieve this?\nContinued my research: apparently, it is possible to modify the Boot Rom (cf. Limera1n).\n\nA: One place to look might be at dual booting an iPhone with Android.\nUpdate: iUsers for iPad now makes this possible. Check out the video.\n\nA: iOS caters to both the iPhone and the iPad. Multi-user support on the iPhone would be superfluous. Multi-user support on the iPad but not on the iPhone would imply considerable fragmentation of the iOS platform. \nIf Apple really wanted to include multi-user support in iOS, partitioning the flash storage and installing several instances of iOS would not be the proper way to go about it. Multi-user support should be accomplished with one instance of iOS and different folders constituting different users' home directories, as is the case with major desktop operating systems. Then user permissions are to be implemented so that one user cannot view another user's files or folders, and thus cannot not read that user's email, etc.\nThough multi-user support can be properly implemented on the iPad, it is uncalled for as \"portable devices\" are often \"personal devices\".\n\nA: No non-jailbroken iOS device (publicly) supports multiple accounts, even if one could partition the storage. I have no experience with jailbroken devices so I can't speak to that scenario.\nI've seen multiple blog entries lamenting the lack of a feature to lock certain types of content (and they even offered up a couple interesting solutions, too).\n\nA: iOS itself supports multiple user accounts, but SpringBoard doesn't support them, as it's tied heavily to the mobile user. Some people have put together mods that allow you to add more accounts for the UI/SpringBoard if you're jailbroken, but support for the ones I can find have dissipated.\n\nA: As this question was asked and last answered a long time ago - things have (slightly) changed today. There is indeed a (limited) multi-user support today for iPads in the educational market. Multiple managed AppleID accounts can be used on a single device and thus it can be shared among several people. There is more information regarding this here:\nhttp://www.apple.com/education/\nhttp://www.apple.com/education/products/#ipad-assistant\n\nEven if students share an iPad, they can make it their own.\nShared iPad is a new feature in iOS 9.3 We designed it for schools that use a shared device model but still want to provide personalized experiences. Before class begins, you can assign any iPad to any student in your classroom. Students know which devices to use because their pictures are on the Lock screens. And they can access their personal content with a password or an easy-to-remember four-digit PIN. After students log in, their homework, apps, and assignments appear exactly as they left them.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3089", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "9"}}

{"text": "Q: Why doesn't iOS 4 have any apps to match Locale on Android? Locale seems to be one of the coolest apps on the Android devices.  Lets you reconfigure multiple aspects of your phone depending on location.  I for example would like to change my default calendar depending on if I'm at work or not.\nI've done a lot of digging to see if iPhone has a similar app.  And all I can find are old articles saying that since iOS doesn't support background tasks (Which it does now), that this feature isn't even possible.  Now that we have background tasks, I can't see whats holding this back, especially in the jailbreak community.\nI'm posting this to see if anybody out there has an app in progress, or has anymore information that I haven't been able to dig up.\nThanks\n\nA: While iOS doesn't support generic background tasks (i.e. doing whatever you want in the background), it does support taking some action when a user enters certain geographical bounds, so it seems like this could technically be possible when moving from work to home or elsewhere.\nMy guess is that it is because iOS is very restrictive about what an app can change about the phone interface. You mention changing the default calendar configuration, which an application cannot do currently with public APIs. Apps are mostly restricted to changing their own settings or firing their own events rather than having access to other apps on the phone.\nCould this change in the future? Sure, if Apple adds more public APIs to change various system or app options. But it seems unlikely considering their interest in a consistent user experience.\n\nA: Implementing such an app on the iPhone would require that either GPS or wifi is active all the time (or at least regularly), which might drain the battery.\nAlso, this app would have to run as a background service all the time, which iOS doesn't really allow. You can run any number of apps but when memory runs low, the least used apps get shut down by the OS. This app should have to be protected against shutdown, which iOS doesn't support. For this reason, this app needs to be written for jailbroken iPhones only.\nTherefore, you won't find such an app in iTunes, but you might find it in Cydia (now or in the future), but I don't know.\n\nNote: I've not jailbroken my iPhone 4 yet but situations like this make me want to. I think that Apple puts too many limits on the devices. If people want to run XYZ on their devices and it redcues their battery life to a few hours, let them if they really want to.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3098", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: Can I use the sound output on both my late 2009 iMac and my Cinema Display?  I purchased a 27\" Cinema Display to go with my late 2009 iMac.\nWhat I would like to do is use the speakers on both displays.  This doesn't seem possible using System Prefs -> Sound.  I can only set it to use one set of speakers or the other.\nIdeally I'd have the cinema display output the left channel while the iMac outputs the right.\nIs there a way to use them both?\n\nA: I don\u2019t know if you can get away with that, but I do know what you can\u2019t do with \u201cthe tools you have\u201d.\nThe first approach would be to - having both output devices connected \u2013 create an Aggregate device that encompasses both. \nLet\u2019s say one device is called: Headphones and the other is Display. \nThe initial approach would be to create the Aggregate device in your Audio MIDI Setup panel, add Headphones and Display as devices, mute Headphones\u2019 left channel and then Display\u2019s right channel. Then happily select this new Aggregate device as your sound output and be super happy.\nSadly that doesn\u2019t work. (I\u2019ve tried it). Apparently the clock synchronization between the \u201cdevices\u201d doesn\u2019t happen and OS X doesn\u2019t really care, therefore only one device outputs audio. (Sad, but true).\n(more information on how to create an Aggregate device that can be found on this Apple Article)\nWhat to do?\nThere\u2019s hope, but I haven\u2019t tried this solution.\nThe idea would be to create an aggregate device of your two sources (Display and Headphones) like we did before, then install JackOSX, set its preference to your new aggregate device, start the Jack\u2019s router, set AudioMIDI Setup to use Jack for I/O, open an app to play your music and connect its output send channels to whatever system playback channels you want in Jack Connection manager.\nThat might work and I suggest you give it a shot. \nMore simple solutions, might involve cabling, Y-Splitters and weird things which I don\u2019t think you want to dive into (specially given that all the audio is Digital and internal, you\u2019re not talking about external speakers per se).\nFinally, although it doesn\u2019t provide simultaneous playback, changing sound sources is very simple with a free utility like SoundSource from your menu bar. (I do it all the time to switch from headphones to speakers).\nHope something of this makes sense. \n\nA: Get two sets of external speakers (one for each monitor), and plug them into a Y-splitter cable, and plug that into the Mac. You'll get the sound balance you seek and, unless you are a hardcore audiophile or have perfect hearing, you won't notice the difference between the analog/digital sound and experience better sound overall. \nJust because there are speakers on your Apple hardware doesn't mean you have to use them, or to put it another way: two pairs of powered, external, analog speakers will beat the sound of the internal-but-wired-the-same-way-as-external speakers any day.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3104", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

Album by Artist does not work as it primary sorts alphabetically by Artist instead of alphabetically by Album, which is what I want.\nWhat I would expect to see here is 'Aphex Twin - Classics' first and then 'Ratatat - Classics', because iTunes should know that it has two albums but from different artists.\nIt looks like you can can set the 'Album Artist' in the id3 tags and it will then sort by that, which means to make this work correctly I'd have to retag all my music and copy the artist into the artist album tag (unless it already existed yadda yadda).

If yes, are they running a Virtual Machine?\n\n*Is your computer Paging too much to disk? (See activity Monitor, memory: Page ins vs. Page outs). A lot of Pageouts is bad (compared to Ins).

You can also set positions/sizes for specific applications in addition to the global setting.\nDori, thanks for that link to Stay, I've been looking for something that does exactly that and I'm running 10.6. Thanks!\n\nA: Any chance of you upgrading to 10.6? If so, you could use Stay from Cordless Dog.\n\nA: Just came across SizeUp which is kind of like Breeze but also seems to have monitor management. I have not tested it but it looks decent:\nEdit:\nAlso there is Optimal Layout which is a very full featured tool but also worth looking at.\n\nA: After looking for this for a while, I would like to say that Stay works wonderfully for saving state and position of windows across multiple displays. You have to save your settings for single screen and dual/multiple screens in order for your positions to be saved across both situations. Optimal layout, though a full feature product unfortunately did not save the window positions or set them back when switching between single screen and dual screen. At least I couldn't figure out how to work with it after only a 30-minute attempt. It's possible that it does but in the short amount of time i had to set this up, I was unable to save.\nThe ability to divide your screens into sections is a really great feature but not the main feature I was looking for in this case.\n\nA: Yes Stay seems to work but it cant shift windows back that have been put into full screen mode. So if you want to maintain a state of full screen items on your laptop, but positioned windows on your external monitor, then unfortunately it doesnt work..\nKind regards, Steve\n\nA: I also like Stay. It works great, and is really simple to use:\n\nHow Does Stay Work?\nMove your windows to where you want them, then have Stay store them. Once stored, windows can be returned to their stored state at any time by having Stay restore them.\n\n\nA: You dont need anything.\nCmd + Alt + Hold down your mouse 1 second at the bottom right corner\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3133", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "29"}}

{"text": "Q: The Casing & Protective Layer for iPhone 4 is Free, or Is It? We all understand that the way to solve iPhone 4's antennagate problem is to use case and a protective layer. As far as I understand, Steve Jobs said that all these case and protective layer is available for free.\nHowever today as I went to an iPhone reseller (I'm located in Malaysia), I was told that I would have to purchase the case and the protective layer \u2013 they would not be given for free.\nNow I'm not sure what's wrong here \u2013 whether it's my understanding of Jobs' word, or if it's how the way the local Apple reseller works. I understand that when Jobs said that these casing would be given for free, it would be free regardless of which country you are in. It certainly doesn't mean that only US stores would give out the case for free, but  every single country in the world which sells iPhone 4 must give it out for free. But the sales representative told me that it's only in the US that the case would be given for free.\nSo I am confused: is the local Apple reseller running around like ancient Chinese warlords and take no directive command from the HQ?\n\nA: The free case program is no longer automatic, and it was never done in-store. You had to download an app to request your free case. (That was their way to make sure only one case was requested per-phone.) I'm also not sure if it was ever valid outside the United States.\nTo get the free case now, you have to call Apple support and complain about phone signal issues. You also have to ask them directly for a free case.\nI have no idea if the same deal applies in Malaysia, but this isn't a case of the store trying to cheat you. They never gave away cases in-store.\n\nA: http://www.apple.com/iphone/case-program/\nI've heard apple support will still send free cases if you complain of reception issues. I don't know what the policy is in Malaysia.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3141", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

{"text": "Q: MacBook Pro Display Adapter Did Apple change the display adapter from MacBook 2006 to MacBook Pro 2010?\nI thought they were the same, (similar size) but they actually differ.\nDo I have to buy a new adapter?\n\nA: The Output port from early MacBook (and MacBook Pros) was a mini-VGA, later a mini-DVI port and various accessories were available to connect regular size VGA displays. 15\" and 17\" PowerBooks had full-size DVI outputs as far as I can remember.\nRecent MacBook models use a smaller mini DisplayPort. Apple itself offers different adapters to transform the mini DisplayPort into VGA, DVI, or HDMI. If you need a VGA adapter (like you say in your question tag), you are looking for this. If, on the other hand, you need to connect a DVI display, then this is what you want.\n\nA: Apple laptops have gone through the following display adapter transitions\n\n\n*\n\n*mini VGA and mini DVI ports were used prior to 2008\n\n*mini Displayport was used 2009 to 2011\n\n*Thunderbolt is being used past 2011\n\n\nThe MacBooks never had mini VGA, they started with mini DVI, but earlier Apple laptops such as the iBook used mini VGA. Before they featured mini DisplayPort, early MacBook Pros used a full size DVI port.\nNote that a Thunderbolt connector is backwards compatible with mini DisplayPort displays and adapters, and looks the same.  It may seem as though there's been no transition in 2011, but the Thunderbolt port enables new functionality that mini DisplayPort did not have prior to 2011.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3146", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: Time Machine: should I partition a 500GB disk? I was considering using Time Machine and I was wondering if creating a 50 GB partition on a disk of 500 GB for it make sense.\n\nA: Technically you could do this, although 50 GB is far too small for most any use these days. \nThe point of concern I think should be raised here is that you look to be hosting both files and backups on the same drive. When (not if\u2014when) the hard drive fails, you will lose both. You would be much better off in the long run keeping the files and backups on separate drives.\nUPDATE (based on comments): The rule of thumb that I've seen for deciding on a drive size to house a Time Machine back up is at least a 2:1 ratio of the drive to be backed up (so a 500GB would mean a 1 TB TM-hosting drive), and I don't see why that general rule couldn't be followed here. \nLook at the data volume of the folders you intended to back up, double that, and that's the size partition you go with. If Time Machine requires a minimum that's below what you calculated, just double the size of that for your partition and off you go. \nEither way, I don't think you're going to find a hard number here.\n\nA: You're interested in using the 50GB partition for Time Machine? Keep in mind that Time Machine keeps multiple copies of changed files - it's not just a single back up of your drive. Your backup drive should be at least a couple times larger than the stuff you're backing up, so Time Machine can keep a decent backlog of changes beyond just the most recent.\nThat said, Time Machine will fill the disk with backlog changes until it can no longer fit them, so as long as you have enough space for a \"most recent\" backup, Time Machine will be happy.\n\nA: TimeMachine already places backups inside a folder on the hard disk, so it will not create a mess on that drive.\nThe only reason you should create a partition is if you would not like TimeMachine to use up as much disk space as it needs. Every time a file changes it will create a new copy of it in the backup, and only pruning old versions once the disk is full. If you create a small partition it will restrict the backup to that size.\n\nA: OK, my question is simple and related; should I absolutely partition a 2T external drive where I want to keep time machine backup for a 250GB macbook and 50 GB of photos (mostly jpeg). & videos?  If it's highly recommended to do so, why?  Thanks!  (and I read the dated reply on losing the data, but that's a risk of any external disk, whether one or more).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3150", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: Can I select only a few specific folders to back up with Time Machine? Can I backup only specific folders with Time Machine? \nIf there is not an \"official\" way to do this, does somebody know a trick to do so?\n\nA: One solution I found is to use Disk Utility to create a new APFS Volume on my main disk, and then I moved all the files I want to back up on this volume (the size of the volume automatically adapts to it's content). \nThen on Time Machine I excluded all my hard drives except my newly created APFS Volume, in that way it's the only one that gets backed up by Time Machine, and I don't need to update the list unless I add new volumes or hard drives.\nAnd if you don't like to have to navigate to this volume to browse your files, you can always create symlinks to them\n\nA: Select All the files and folders in the disc that contains the folder you want to back up.\nDrop them all on the Exclusions window\nRemove the folder you want backed up from the exclusions\n\nA: tmutil enables you to edit the exclusion list from the command line.\nBecause blacklisting folders one by one can be tedious, I wrote deus_ex_tmachina bash script that basically iterate over the folders at the root of your disk and exclude them ; stopping in the middle of the process so you can edit the list.\n\nA: You may exclude items from a Time Machine backup as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Click Time Machine.\n\n*After having enabled Time Machine and chosen a backup disk, click Options.\n\n*Click + to specify an item that is not to be backed up. The backup disk is included on this list automatically so that it does not back up itself.\n\n\nA: Easily - no. Time Machine's selection only uses exclusion so you'd have to exclude everything but the folders you want. I'd recommend looking at a different solution instead (eg. rsync, Retrospect, or other backup software)\n\nA: I'm not sure if time machine follows symbolic links, but if so, you could have a high level directory full of links to the directories you want backed-up, then exclude all the top level directories except that one....slightly roundabout, but not too work intensive (if time machine backs up the content of symbolic links, which I slightly doubt, but should be checked....)\n\nI checked. It does not work. Other ideas?\n\nA: In my case I have items on an external drive that I want to have backed-up. What I do is create a partition on that drive and then remove that partition from the exclusion list. \n\nA: I answered this elsewhere as well, sorry for the redundancy but this question is asked multiples times on this site alone.  Time Machine (And excluding files) is not a good solution.  \nShort answer... \"Get Backup 3\" from the Mac Apps Store.\nI'm looking for the same solution, (Or was).  Basically I want to back up just one folder multiple times a day to a flash drive, similar to the way Time Machine does.  BETTER YET! (Million $ idea here...) I would like a local cloud, i.e. I make a change, it updates my local backup on my flash drive to be in sync right then and there when I make the change (Like drop box does).  The closest thing I have found is \"Get Backup 3\" on the Mac App store.  You can choose an Origin folder and a destination folder and set it to synchronize the two.  You can choose the direction as well which is great, : Folder A to Folder B, or Folder B to Folder A, or even Bi-Directional updates.  You can also schedule sync times.  I set mine up for close to the end of the day.  It backs up and I leave my thumb drive at work in case my laptop ever gets stolen at least I have a copy of my files backed up (Network here is very restrictive and painfully slow).\nHope that helps.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3159", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "40"}}

It's usually a server issue but you seem to have narrowed that out by the details you posted.\nGiving the iPhone a totally fresh database then re-establishing sync often helps when the databases are failing to sync correctly.\nSince there is no way to just start over for contacts only, you have a short dance of steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable all contact syncing over the air.\n\n*Power cycle the phone\n\n*Use a test account (i make a new user account on my mac with an empty address book) - syncing from iTunes to overwrite all contacts stored on the phone clears the data store well.

{"text": "Q: How can I get iTunes to automatically refresh the media library? Most of the media players that have a \"media library\" functionality usually self-refresh the library when files are added or removed. As I share the media library with other media players (I use iTunes only to copy music on the iPod), I would like iTunes to automatically refresh when I add, remove, or rearrange audio tracks in the file system. How can I get iTunes to do this?\n\nA: What you call a \u201cdesign\u201d flaw, is not such thing. It\u2019s a design decision made by the iTunes team. Although iTunes lets you \u201cmanually manage your library\u201d, it\u2019s never intended to let you move things around in the filesystem, add, remove or modify files. \nThe premise for iTunes happiness is that you always add the items to the library and modify things from within iTunes. You have the choice to let iTunes \u201corganize\u201d the library (which will copy the media to the iTunes library folder and organize it there as he wants) or you can leave it wherever you originally had it, but iTunes doesn\u2019t \u201cread\u201d or \u201cmonitor\" the filesystem for changes. It knows things changed when the library.xml is changed, and the only application that does that is iTunes itself. \nIs this the best way?\nYes and no, it has advantages, but a lot of people miss the \u201cWinamp-like\u201d ease of use and it\u2019s understandable. On the other hand, it simplifies a lot of things for a lot of people. It has decently worked for quite a few years now.\nBut that\u2019s the topic for another discussion. :)\n\nA: In addition to Martin's answer, I would point out that a major reason for this design decision is speed.  If iTunes had to scan the filesystem for changes every time it ran, the program could potentially slow to a crawl.\nThere are a number of tricks and third party utilities you can use to get around this behavior.  The wiki for MusicBrainz Picard has some quick tips on refreshing metadata info, like using the \"Get Info\" menu item to refresh individual track information.  They also detail a small AppleScript that will refresh multiple tracks at once.\nAs for adding and removing files, the best way to get around this is to not try to get around it in the first place.  Use the \"Add to Library\" and \"Delete\" functions in iTunes itself.  However, if you do decide to remove files without using the iTunes \"Delete\" function, you can use a script such as \"Super Remove Dead Tracks\" from Doug's Apple Scripts For iTunes.\n\nA: Itunes Folder Watch is the external app you require for this functionality  http://albumbrowser.klarita.net/itfw.html\n\nA: My answer is use a different music manager. That is what I have done. iTunes use to pickup on new music I added but now you have to put it the \"watch folder\" and of course then it moves it from there into the library.  That wont work when I use Google Music Manager and have my cloud music sync to my hard drive.  So iTunes is out for me.\n\nA: The only way I have found success is deleting the itunes index and then adding the main directory of music again....sucks but seems to work.\n\nA: (I'm running iTunes in Windows) I had to do it the hard way after running a program to remove duplicates from my computer. I changed the location of my iTunes library in preferences. Then, I selected all songs in iTunes and deleted them (they didn't delete off of my original library location).\nI then changed my library location back to where my music is located.\nThen, I opened Windows explorer and navigated to the folder where all of my music is and selected all the folders except the \"Automatically add to iTunes\" folder. I dragged all music folders into the \"Automatically add to iTunes\" folder and moved them there.\niTunes detected them and then refreshed the library.\nIt was a small hassle, but at least my duplicate files are gone now.\n\nA: As others have mentioned, I don't know that you can get iTunes to automatically track changes, but here's one possible work-around.\nI keep my music on an external hard drive, and whenever I add new music to it, I go to File -> Add Folder to Library, and point it to my external HDD.  I also have (under Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced) unchecked the \"Keep iTunes Media folder organized\" and \"Copy files to iTunes...\".\nThis works for adding files, but unfortunately does not detect removed files.  It also means that you'll only be able to add files to your devices when the HDD is attached.\nI also have \"Manually manage music\" selected for my ipod, but I don't think that's related to how I store my music.\n\nA: As an addition to the above answer: I put all new music to be added to the iPod in a seperate folder then point iTunes to this folder under \"add folder\". I then add these files/folders to my HDD library and delete them from the seperate folder. 'Works for me.\n\nA: if using window 7 you can move all music files o itunes . itunes media . music\nthen right click music library properties remove the current monitered folder change it to the itunes >itunes media > music \nyou will have to do something simaler with windows media player \nopen window media player orginize>mange librarys>music remove the current monitered folder add tunes >itunes media > music to monitered folders\nTo clear the Windows Media Player database, follow these steps:\na. Exit Windows Media Player.\nb. Click Start, click Run, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Media Player, and then click OK.\nc. Select all the files in the folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.\nNote: You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.\nd. Restart Windows Media Player.\nNote: Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.\n\nA: Sorry if this answer is located elsewhere in the thread. I didn't see it, so figured I would add my two cents worth. The easiest way I found to do this is to just re-add the library folder (without deleting the library because that is time consuming and unnecessary) for example. I keep all my movies on an external drive in a folder marked iPod Movies, and not in my iTunes media folder that is designated in my preferences. So, whenever I add new movies to that external drive, I just re-add the iPod Movies folder \"File>Add Folder to Library>\". It always adds the new movies I've put in the iPod Movies Folder. It is still a manual process, but it is quick and it adds all movies I've added since the last time I did this, and it is free and doesn't use up memory running in the background (unlike the albumbrowser recommended above).

For more information check the Apple Business solutions, you might get away with what you need without having to use ADmitmac.\nIf your problem is that you have to type cmd+k every time you want to connect to a dfs share, you could always -once connected- drag that share to the right side of the dock, where it will create a direct access to the share. Next time you click on that, if the share is not connected, it will try to do that. This works for any type of connection (at least Windows Shares work too and I recall using nfs).

{"text": "Q: Why does spaces keep capturing keyboard input some times after switching spaces? I'm running snow leopard on a fairly new macbook pro 13\" (september 2010).\nSometimes the black visualization showing the available spaces and the space I'm currently on doesn't disappear when I have switched between two spaces. When this happens, spaces seems to steals keyboard input from the application(s) on the space I have switched to. Sometimes the visualization disappears after I keep switch spaces some more, but sometimes I have to force a reboot. \nAlso, spaces seems quite slow at times. \nDoes anybody else experience the same thing, and is there anything to be done about it?\n\nA: I find that killing the Dock only sometimes makes the problem go away. Usually keyboard input returns, but if I switch spaces using the keyboard shortcuts, the visualisation sticks around & keyboard input is stolen again.\nWhat I have found to work is putting the display to sleep. I've had the bottom right corner of the screen set to do that for ages, so it's quite convenient for me. I've never had this method fail; once the screen is awoken, the problem is gone & doesn't return when I switch spaces again.\nTo me this suggests that the problem isn't actually in Dock, it's in the system's EventTap subsystem, the bit that lets stuff like Spaces, Screen Sharing, LaunchBar, & Spotlight take keystrokes before the focussed application gets them. I've actually experienced a similar problem with Screen Sharing, where the system whose screen is being shared gets its keyboard input mangled if a modifier key is pressed on the viewing computer & not released until Screen Sharing has lost focus. It's sort of the reverse problem, but it indicates that perhaps the Spaces problem is the EventTap framework getting stuck in a similar way, never sending the message that Control isn't being held down any more.\n\nA: I experience the same issue on a regular basis. Pressing CMD+W right after noticing that the spaces window will persist makes the window disappear most times.\nIf it doesn't, you can kill Dock from Activity Monitor (start it from the Applications folder in your Dock, select 'Dock' and click 'End Process' or the like). This always makes keyboard input work again, but the issue will reappear very soon.\nIf I could, I also would give bounty for this!\n/Update: The Mac OS X 10.6.5 changelog suggests that this issue will be fixed in that version:\n\nAddresses keyboard responsiveness\n  issues in the Dock when Spaces is\n  turned on.\n\n\nA: I haven't figured out the why of it, per se, but I have figured out a good way to get around it; I created an Applescript application that lives in my dock that allows me to kill the Dock when this happens (since the keyboard is no longer responsive at that point).\nCreate this script in the AppleScript editor and save it as an application somewhere:\nset app_name to \"Dock\"\ndo shell script (\"killall \" & app_name)\n\nAdd it to your Dock, and when Spaces grabs all keyboard input you can click it to restart the Dock, which will allow you to proceed.\n\nA: This comment on the apple subreddit led me to this thread where people discuss this issue in relation to an application called Cinch. In the thread about this on the apple forums, people mention several other applications that might be causing this issue too.\nWhat is causing this issue?\nFrom what I can gather, this issue seems to be related to applications using Event Taps (an API that lets applications directly listen for keyboard and mouse events). I think there is either A) a bug in OS X where Event Taps sometimes stop working for whatever reason, or B) application programmers  consistently have a hard time using Event Taps correctly.\nWhat can I do about it?\nIf this is indeed caused by an OS X bug (this seems the most likely to me), this issue can't be fixed completely by end users. There is one thing you can do that might make it happen less frequently though: In the Cinch thread, there is a link to an application that lists all running applications that have Event Taps open. It looks like this:\nI figure that the more applications you are running that have an Event Tap open, the more often you'll end up with a clogged Event Tap somewhere, and you'll have the spaces issue happen more often as a consequence of this.\nSo, if you're having this issue, try running as few of the applications that show up in EventTaps.app as you can.\nFor whenever the issue does happen, kill the Dock using whatever method you find most convenient. I keep the AppleScript snippet that Chris R posted in his answer in an .app on my Desktop, and run it whenever spaces locks up.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3211", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}

{"text": "Q: Why am I getting a \"dubious ownership of file\" error when Launch Agent runs my .plist file? I have a Launch Agent configured to run a .plist file for example: /Library/LaunchAgent/foo.plist. Inside this .plist, it is set to run during LoginWindow and Aqua.\nWhen I attempt to launch my computer and get to the login screen, this plist should run but instead gives the following error (in the console):\n\nlaunchctl: Dubious ownership on file (skipping): /Library/LaunchAgents/foo.plist\n\nWhen I attempt to login in to a non-admin account, it gives the exact same error message. When I attempt to login with an admin account, it works fine.\nI'll be honest, I don't know much about Mac OS X privileges and permissions.\nTo create the file, I opened it up in emacs, with sudo on the admin account (e.g. by using the su command since the other account doesn't have sudo privileges) and then saved it.\nWhich account do I need to use to create the file so that it works for all users?\nDo I need to use the sudo command?\nDo I need to change the file permissions (e.g. use chmod)?\nIs there an easy way to take an existing file and change its ownership instead of having to recreate the file?\nCould someone please explain why this error happens?\n\nA: If a plist is owned by root and writable by a user other than root, that's a security issue.\nYou can change the owner to root with sudo chown root <filename>, and change the permissions with sudo chmod 644 <filename> (4 for read access, 2 for write access, 1 for execute access, added up. The first number is for the owner, the second for the group, the third for everyone.)\n\nA: From the launchctl(1) manpage\u2019s description of the load subcommand:\n\nNote that per-user configuration files (LaunchAgents) must\n                be owned by the user loading them. All system-wide daemons (LaunchDaemons) must be owned by\n                root. Configuration files must not be group- or world-writable. These restrictions are in\n                place for security reasons, as allowing writability to a launchd configuration file allows one\n                to specify which executable will be launched.\n\nlaunchctl has several \u201cDubious \u2026\u201d messages. The launchd code for 10.6.7 (for example) has three such messages in its launchctl.c (see the function path_goodness_check).\n\n\n*\n\n*Dubious permissions on file (skipping): <pathname>  \n\n*Dubious ownership on file (skipping): <pathname>  \n\n*Dubious path. Not a regular file or directory (skipping): <pathname>\nTo avoid these messages a pathname must be (#3) a regular file or directory1 (or a symlink to one) that is (#1) owned by root or the invoking user and (#2) not \u201cgroup\u201d or \u201cother\u201d writable (i.e. chmod go-w).\n1\nNo named pipes, block/character special device nodes, local domain sockets, etc.\n\nYour file is probably owned by the admin user since you say that you do not get the message when logging in as that user (the pathname is owned by the invoking user in that case).\nTo make the pathname work for other users, it should be owned by root.\nTo arrange this, do:\nsudo chown root /Library/LaunchAgent/foo.plist\n\n\nA: Thanks for the answer (changing owner to root) -- that's all I needed.\nTo make this a bit more than a 'me too' post... I got here via a convoluted path: I was getting \"This API can only be used by a process running within an Aqua session\" errors for a launchdaemon.\nSearching for an answer to that led me to Apple's technote on daemons and agents which explained how to resolve the 'Aqua session' error, but that left me with 'dubious ownership' issues. That's how I got here, where my final issue was resolved.\nMaybe adding all of that to this discussion will cause some search engine to link this page to one of the precursory issues, thereby saving some future adventurer some time.\n\nA: This is what happens when people do not know how sudo works. To disable services that are on files owned by your user just call launchtl without sudo. \n\nA: for file in ~/Library/LaunchAgent owned by the user and not root dont sudo, if you do youll have to change the ownership since you are loading it from the root user\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3250", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "54"}}

Now that I have finally upgraded :-), here's what I learned. \nBasically, don't use a self-signed certificate for code signing. Generate a certificate using your Apple ID in Xcode instead. To recap the steps briefly:\nIn Xcode > Preferences > Accounts, select your Apple developer ID, click \"Manage Certificates\", select the \"+\" in the bottom left corner, it offers you the option \"Apple Development\". Select that, this will make a certificate for you. By Ctrl-clicking on the new certificate you can export it (in .p12 format), and by open-ing that .p12 file it gets loaded into your Login keychain.\nYou will see that this certificate is valid for a year, \"Issued by: Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority\". I suspect that is trustworthier than a self-signed certificate.\nNow you can sign your app as before with codesign -f -s <apple_ID> /path/to/prog. I tried it with a simple binary (compiled from hello.c :-) ), and it could be verified with codesign -v.\nI haven't tried it with Python packages yet, so I have no advice to people who mentioned in their comments that this cannot sign \"python.app\".\n\nA: If you're programming in Go:\n\nhttp.ListenAndServe(\u201clocalhost:8080\u201d, nil)\n\nInstead of:\n\nhttp.ListenAndServe(\u201c:8080\u201d, nil)\n\n\nA: Just a note though, if you are using a Virtual environment, be sure to sign the app that is being used for the environment. I know this is obvious, but needed to be said nevertheless.\n\nA: I got help in Sayan Mohsin's answer, and I believe it's more generic than go.\nI had this issue with a piece of software that does not need to allow connections from the outside, only from my machine.\nSuch software does not need to be signed to avoid this warning: it only needs to explicitly listen on localhost only.\nDepending on your environment, setting a host restriction will be done differently.\nIn my case, I was working with an nginx server, and changing its configuration from listen  8080 to listen  127.0.0.1:8080 was enough to fix it.\nIf this is also your case, you should definitely check out if your server exposes a way to setup host restriction and set it up to localhost or 127.0.0.1.\n\nA: If you're looking for a way to disable this alert for the iOS Simulator, you can use this script from Tom Soderling:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Script to disable the iOS Simulator app from showing the \"Do you want the application xxxx to accept incoming network connections?\" pop-up every time the app is run\n\necho \"> Enter password to temporarily shut firewall off\"\nsudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate off\n\necho \"> Add Xcode as a firewall exception\"\n/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode\n\necho \"> Add iOS Simulator as a firewall exception\"\n/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app/Contents/MacOS/Simulator\n\necho \"> Re-enable firewall\"\nsudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on\n\nexit 0\n\nNote that you have to run it again after every restart.

The plist is responsible for a lot of behaviors and I'm willing to bet either an upgrade to the OS or the app can cause the \"link\" to break.\n\n\nAbout plist files...   A plist is a special kind of text file that contains properties the application and other resources, typically the OS, use to retain and reuse information needed to run the application. plist is a file type and has many uses, typically storing user preferences, but, essentially, it is an XML file. You can look to see if there are any caches, which are typically plist files, for the applications in question in /Library/Caches and /System/Library/Caches. There is also one in ~/Library/Caches/ but bad things can happen when mucking around in there, so just leave it alone. The system goes into those folders for a wide variety of reasons, and I usually clean out the first two folders I listed completely about once a month.\n\nA: This relates to whether the app is signed or not. If it's not signed, the preference won't be remembered.\nTo see if an app is signed do this in Terminal:\ncd path/to/your/app\ncodesign -vvv Eclipse.app/\n\nFor Eclipse - mine says it's not signed at all. I can't comment further on how to sign the app since I've not bothered to do that but this answer on superuser covers it:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/100013/why-does-the-mac-os-x-firewall-dialog-recurringly-pop-up-and-disappear-by-itself#300841\n\nA: I appreciate that this is an old Q & A, but it was the first hit on google for me when I had the same problem.  Just wanted to add something for others that may land here.\nIn order to execute any of the codesign commands outlined here, it is necessary to have the xcode command line tools installed.  Without these, one gets an error message:\nxcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun\n\nTo fix this, install the tools with:\nxcode-select install\n\nI would've commented on ahall's post, but I don't have the reputation points to do so.\n\nA: My situation involves two copies of Eclipse installed on MacOS Mojave 10.14.5.  The first copy was authorised with the MacOS firewall.  The second copy would always present the \"accept incoming connections\" prompt.  Choosing \"Accept\" would continue to present the message after each reboot, apparently the firewall setting was not updated.  \nThe solution was to open MacOS System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall, unlock the screen, Firewall Options.  Select Eclipse.app \"Allow incoming connections\" and remove it with the \"-\" button.  The next time I selected \"Allow\" to the Eclipse \"accept incoming connections\" prompt was the last.\n\nA: The solution for me was to just disable the firewall completely. It's extremely common to create web-enabled pieces of software that are of course unsigned because you're compiling them natively. \nOpen the spotlight with CMD + Spacebar and search \"privacy\" and select \"Security and Privacy\". Then switch to the \"Firewall\" tab and disable the firewall there.\n\nA: I got this dialogue box (Canon ccpd) everytime after starting my computer. Open firewall > security and privacy > unlock to enable changes > click on button \"Enable stealth mode\" > click button \"Block all incoming connections\".\nNo more irrating dialogue box from Canon printer driver after that.\n\nA: I tried all the above in Mac 10.13 and nothing worked. \nIn the end I wrote a script that ran at logout attached to login hook that turned off firewall so when logged in it no longer needed permission then using delayedlauncher ran another script that turned on firewall.\nAll good now\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3271", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "121"}}

If I select an email in Mail.app and do \u2318+C, I can then paste the entire email (including header info) in a rich text editor app, such as TextEdit or VoodooPad. However, I'm not able to paste it into a plain text editor like TextMate or into a terminal window. \n(Oddly, I can paste into into TextEdit in plain text mode, which is exactly what I want to be able to do with other apps).\nWhy does it do this? Is there a workaround? Note that Plain Clip does not work as a workaround in this case.\n\nA: This is because of how you can program the pasteboard on Mac OS X.\nText editors expect the pasteboard to contain, well, text data. There are however several kinds of text: there's plain text, there's formatted (RTF) text, there's formatted text with embedded documents (RTFD), there's HTML-formatted text, and a bunch of others.\nWhen you copy something, the application tells the pasteboard how this data can be represented. There are usually several suitable representations: for instance, copying your question exports data in the pasteboard that can be represented as a web archive, RTF data, and plain text in three different encodings. Plenty of types that applications are likely to support.\nHowever, when you copy a mail from Mail, it exports only as two types of data: plain UTF-8 text and a RTFD document. Cocoa tries to paste as an RTFD document because it likes them better, but applications say \"no no, I can't do that\"; they usually support getting text from RTF, but not from RTFD since RTFD usually has embedded resources such as images, and you end up pasting nothing because the apps don't bother to look for the plain text data.\nTextEdit, on its side, is able to edit RTFD documents, so it has no problem pasting the data.\n\nA: On Lion (and possibly earlier; I haven't checked), Mail has this menu item which you might choose to use before copying a message to paste elsewhere:\n\nView > Message > Plain Text Alternative\n\nThere's another option, but it opens a separate window and requires you to wade through potentially unhelpful email headers that are typically hidden:\n\nView > Message > Raw Source\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3273", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: Spotlight loses index of Applications When I get warnings that my HD is nearly full (Macbook Air, 64GB SSD), spotlight always loses its index of applications. That means that I can't launch Safari or Mail or other apps, which is the only thing I use Spotlight for. Only restarting helps to resolve this.\nIs there a way to force Spotlight to reindex the Application folder?\n\nA: This happens whenever I erase the free space on my hard drive (probably for the same reason -- that process creates a big file that eats up all the free space, then overwrites it, creating a low space condition in the process).  Typing this command at the terminal:\n\nsudo mdutil -i on /Volumes/Hard_Disk_Name_Goes_Here\n\nwill rebuild your index.

That usually clears any spotlight problems.\nAlso, running so low in disk space is never a good idea, try to make some room for the sake of your OS stability. That is also the reason why restarting fixes it, because when you restart, temp stuff gets deleted and there\u2019s more \u201croom\u201d to play with in your HDD.

Have there been any studies done / reports published, or is it just assumed that you probably will need a new iPhone before the flash dies (with normal use)?\n\nA: From Wikipedia:\nLED Flash (Illumination)\n\nAlthough they are not yet at the power levels to replace xenon flash devices in still cameras, LEDs (specifically, high current flash LEDs) have recently been used as flash sources in camera phones. LEDs are expected to approach the power levels of xenon in the near future and may replace built-in xenon flashes in still cameras.

What are the minimum requirements?\n\nA: Today, I'd go with either a 15\" or 17\" MacBook Pro. They would allow you to work with the iPad simulator at its native resolution. It's a bit too big to run full-size on the 13\" models, so I always end up running it at half size, which is less than ideal. Even if you're not planning to develop for the iPad right now, I'd still plan the hardware purchase around that possibility.

You just need the right video and audio adapters.\nApple sells two adapters to connect your MacBook's Mini DisplayPort to DVI or VGA. Neither of those will include audio, so you'll also need to get audio cables.

{"text": "Q: How can I know exactly which songs I have purchased from iTunes? The purchase history of iTunes and the email receipts don't show me exactly which version (i.e. album and song number) of a song I have previously purchased.\nHow can I view this information?\n\nA: The trick is to navigate to iTunes new interface for albums (not search results) (e.g. by clicking the album's name). Instead of seeing the song price, you will see the word \"Purchased\".\nTo get to the song's album, you can either search for the artist and try the 1-3 likely albums the song might be located in until you find the \"purchased\" text, or you could click the \"Write a Review\" link for the song in your email receipt. Note that when you click the \"Write a Review\" link, you will be taken to iTunes old interface for albums. You must click the album name at the top to get to the new interface, which shows the \"Purchased\" text.\nAnother thing to note is that I noticed that if a song you purchased belongs to an album with only one song (i.e. it's the only song in the album), the \"Purchased\" text won't appear.\n\nA: Create a smart playlist and use \"kind contains protected\" as the first rule and \"kind contains purchased\" as a second rule.\n\nA: if you go to iTunes on your device and you can navigate to the purchased section, this will then list all the songs you have purchased on iTunes, you will also be able to download the songs to your device if you haven't got them on there already.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3310", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}
{"text": "Q: Why do compilation albums sometimes show up as 100s of identical album covers? Does anyone know, why some compilation albums (purchased on iTunes Shop) sometimes appear as 100s of album covers in the album overview?   (as opposed to what one would expect, just 1 album or atleast 1 per CD)\n(would have posted a picture here to show what I mean, but I am apparently not allowed to)\nAnd, probably more importantly, what's the fix?   I've been meddling around with \"compilation\" properties on the songs, but that doesn't seem to help much. This is really annoying me lol, almost to the point of me considering just deleting the albums only to get rid of this...   hoping someone has an alternative suggestion ;-)\n\nA: It's possible the \"Part of a compilation\" meta data wasn't set for these tracks. You can group them together as a single \"album\" in iTunes by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Selecting all the tracks you want to come from the same album (use Cmd-Left Click to select multiple, non-contiguous tracks) \n\n*Hitting \u2318-I to bring up the meta-data editor window and then: \n\n\n*\n\n*For the Album Arist field enter: Various Arists\n\n*For the Album field enter the name of the compilation album\n\n*And then make sure the Part of a compilation option box is checked\n\n\n*Click OK to apply the changes to all the tracks\n\n\nYou should now see them grouped together in the grid view as one album, all showing (hopefully) the same cover art. If they're not showing the same cover art:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the cover art you like.\n\n*Copy it to the clipboard with \u2318-C\n\n*select all the tracks again and open the meta-data editor window.\n\n*Click once in the Artwork window and hit \u2318-V to paste the cover art to all the tracks.\n\n*Click OK to add the cover art to every track in the compilation.\n\n\nA: The reason why there are so many covers is that each song comes from a separate album hence the 100s of album covers.\nThe fix would be to remove each song's cover art (I believe it has to be done for each song manually) and then applying a new image in bulk for all songs. To do so, select all songs, then (command-i or Ctrl-i on windows) and then drop the artwork onto the big white square on the right of the dialog that just popped.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3312", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: Why is my battery time so much shorter after jailbreak? I've been impressed with the better battery time of my new iPhone 4 as compared to the 3G I had before. Yesterday evening, I finally jailbroke the 4, and the battery time today has been much worse than usual. Why is this?\nI installed a very few programs from Cydia: FolderCloser, NoLockScreen, SBSettings, biteSMS, PdaNet, My3G. Note that I haven't used PdaNet yet, so I would rule that out as a culprit. Also, while My3G is set up, I haven't actually done any faux-wifi stuff today: no Skype, no wifi-only downloads, etc. I've deliberately used 3G less than on normal days, and not used wifi at all (also not as a hotspot). I've not played music at all today, in fact I've barely turned it on at all! The screen brightness is as usual, at about 70%. The phone was charged to 100% overnight as always. \nDespite this, the battery is already under 40% at 5 p.m. where it would normally still be well above 60%. At this rate, I don't think it will even make it until I get home -- which is worse than the battery life of my old 3G!\nWhat's depleting my battery faster than usual, and how can I prevent that?\nUpdate: The first day of jailbroken battery life must have been a fluke, or was fixed by rebooting. I've been through a few cycles now and battery life seems to be practically unchanged after all.\n\nA: I can see two main possibilities: \n\n\n*\n\n*Apps like FolderCloser, NoLockScreen, and SBSettings shorten battery life by requiring heavy background processes. The only solution to this would be either to not install these apps or restore the phone to its original state altogether (and not have these apps installed). I am convinced that jailbreaking allows for processes that are not in phase with Apple's careful thriftiness of battery use.\n\n*Your battery is not calibrated properly so your iPhone miscalculates the remaining percentage. The solution here would be to drain your battery completely and then fully charge it.\nGood luck! And know that you can restore the phone to its original state.\n\nA: I think many of the jailbroken apps continue to run using a full multitasking approach. This is different than the iOS multitasking, which just keeps apps in ram, etc. Those apps staying open, and even using very little processing power, would be using extra processor cycles, therefore depleting faster. \nAlso (I haven't jailbroken before), the jailbroken iOS may even be running more services in the background than a normal iOS install. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3344", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

{"text": "Q: Converting a PDF for use with DVD Studio Pro I have a client who want me to add PDF's to a DVD, so that people can view them through their televisions\nCan it be done?\n\nA: Sure. You need to convert the pages of the PDF into images and handle accordingly from there, much like a photo slide show. The primary concern I would have is whether the PDF is laid out so that it looks good on screen.\nAcrobat (the full version, not Reader) can export all pages to a variety of formats. Acrobat costs good money, but Preview only exports the first page.

{"text": "Q: How do you position your hand to use the command key? What finger do you use? Sorry in advance about what seems like a trivial question.  However, I've recently switched from PC to Mac, and while I'm really happy about the switch, this is one of the few issues I'm struggling with.\nOn a PC, the most important shortcuts are CTRL-A (select all), CTRL-C (copy), and CTRL-V (paste). Almost all the other important shortcuts also use the CTRL key.\nOn the PC keyboard, the CTRL key is in the bottom left corner of the keyboard. So, it's very easy to hold it with your pinky, while keeping your hand in its normal position, so you can easily press the other key required for the shortcut (e.g., A, C, V, etc).\nOn a Mac, the \"equivalent\" key to CTRL is Command. However, I can't easily reach that key with any finger - especially without moving my hand from its normal position - so, I can't easily press Command-C or Command-V without really focusing on it.\nIs this just a result of years of practicing on a PC? What finger do Mac users use to click the command key when executing a shortcut?\n\nA: When I first made the switch to Mac I used System Preferences -> Keyboard to switch the \u2318 key with ^ (control) key. That worked for a while until I became more comfortable with the basic two-key commands. Once I started using more complex three and four key commands I had to put it back to default because I needed the labels on the keys at first to remember what the symbols <-> key mappings were.\n\nA: I mostly use my thumb. If I'm trying to hit a key that's more in the middle or right side of the keyboard (such as C or V), I use my ring finger.\nNote that I'm a horrible typist, so I never use the right \u2318 key. If you're comfortable using that, you can probably just use your thumbs.\n\nA: You can use either thumb to hold down a \u2318 key and then use another finger to access the other key. You just have to get used to sliding either thumb a little to the left or to the right of the space bar.\nYes, this is just a result of years of using a PC.\n\nA: It's easier to type shortcuts if you use Sticky Keys as well. This way you can type shortcuts one key at a time, which might sound slower, but isn't if it means you can keep your hands in position and your eyes on the screen. \nI tend to use my thumb for command. I use my left pinky for control, shift and Fn, although it may be different for others as I keep my pinkies over the row below the home row. Alt is tricky, but I guess the pinky makes the most sense for me personally, usually.\nThere's nothing wrong in using different fingers at different times. For instance on the rare occasion I want to show the Dock (\u2303\u2325\u2318F) I move my arm and use index on cmd, middle on alt and ring on control, then type the D afterwards.\n\nA: I also thought it was inconvenient at start but later realised how good it is with the command button. I learnt to type on a keyboard with no markings which requires you to have all keys memorised and your fingers on the right position on the keyboard. By using the command button with your thumb (which is regularly only used for the space ), your fingers are always positioned correctly on the keyboard. Using the control button, you HAVE to use your pinky finger which makes your fingers leave the correct position, which in the end makes you look at the keyboard!\n(by correct position i mean, pinky on A, ring finger on S, middle finger on D, long finger on F etc.)\n\nA: Here is the official advice from Apple\nOn page 67, they state the following:\n\nUse a light touch when typing or using the trackpad and keep your hands and fingers relaxed. Avoid rolling your thumbs under your palms.\n\nBased on this, it would be my assumption that they intend you to either move your entire hand and use your thumb or pointer finger. If you find this unnatural, you can always change the control key to perform the duty of the command key. Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys, and change the buttons around as you see fit.\n\n\n\nA: Very late reply but just giving my 2 cents as a long time Apple Magic Keyboard user who's been using a more standard keyboard layout for around 4 months.\nNote: This only applies to the official Apple keyboards like the Magic Keyboard.\nI have to disagree with some of the comments on the accepted answer which say to avoid using the thumb. Due to the Apple keyboards having a much smaller spacebar than the average PC keyboard layout, the thumb movement required to reach the Command key is very minimal. So minimal in fact, that the thumb knuckle is usually the only joint that requires movement and the amount of movement is generally within the natural range of the thumb. In other words, it's a very comfortable movement. That's at least how I feel and I have generally medium-small hands.\nIf however, you're using a non-Apple keyboard with a larger spacebar, yes, it's not advisable to use your thumbs for command as the additional movement required could cause you problems in the long run.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3374", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "61"}}
{"text": "Q: What does no chime on boot mean? My MacBook Pro is having some issues. It boots. But the graphics card doesn't get detected. You can remote in to it but looking at the Displays dialog in System Preferences, no graphics card is shown:\n\nI took it in to see if it qualified for the free mobo replacement because it does have the qualifying NVidia chipset and the repair shop said they couldn't run the diagnostics tool on it because it wouldn't chime on boot. And therefore wouldn't boot from their external drive to run their diagnostics. I hadn't noticed that it wouldn't chime on boot.\nBut what does that mean? What does the chime tell you? Why would the machine not chime?\n\nA: You don't specify how old your MBP is, but some MBPs built a few years ago shipped with graphics cards that fatally crashed after a few years of years. That's what happened to mine and it was a warranty fix because a recall was done.\nMy understanding of the chime is that it is hard-coded into the motherboard. If it is not playing with the chime, then you probably have something wrong down to that level. It may be a simple fix, it may not, but only Apple will be able to tell you definitively.\n(Answer edited per comments)\n\nA: As an aside, the volume of the chime is governed by the operating system - the Mac will remember how you had your volume set when you last shut it down. If you made your Mac mute, you won't hear a chime on startup.\nIt might be worth plugging in a pair of headphones - it's unlikely that you would have set the volume 'with headphones' to be mute, and as the Mac remembers a level for 'normal' and a level for 'headphones', you might hear a chime.\nStill, any decent Genius Bar staff would have known that you can make the chime go silent this way so I'm guessing it's more serious than this!\n\nA: It usually means the Power On Self-Test failed. Look for an error code as tones, flashing LEDS, or whatever remaining means the particular computer has of communicating.

{"text": "Q: Install Tiger in VMware Fusion I've got 10.6 running on a 2006 MacBook Pro.  I want to run some older software that was meant for 10.4 and earlier, so I figured I'd install Tiger in VMware Fusion, but it isn't working.  Any idea how I'd go about it?\nWhat I've tried:\nWhen creating a new VM, there's no option for Tiger.  It only offers 10.5 server and 10.6 server.  I tried using the 10.5 server option with a Tiger disk image, but with no luck: gives me this error:\n\nMac OS X is not supported with software virtualization.\n  To run Mac OS X you need a host on which VMware Fusion supports hardware virtualization.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: This article references VMware Workstation 6 as being able to run OS X with some hacks, but it's slow. But more importantly, that article runs down what I thought was the only known solution to running OS X in a VM: VirtualBox. So you aren't going to be able to do this with Fusion, but you can do it with VirtualBox.\nAlso: Apple does allow virtualization of OS X Server (check the date on that article - circa 2007). It honestly wouldn't stand much of a chance in the big, corporate IT world if it couldn't be legally virtualized these days.\n\nA: The official Tiger (10.4) OS simply does not run in a virtualized environment.  To get it to run you have to hack around the incompatibilities, which has been attempted with varying levels of (claim to) success, but it seems pretty sketchy.  You're probably better off either dual-booting your MBP or finding an old used computer to dedicate to Tiger apps.  I have a G5 still kicking around for just that purpose. \nFYI:\nLeopard (10.5) and Snow Leopard (10.6) server are virtualizable and are fully supported by VMware Fusion.  Leopard and Snow Leopard standard versions (\"Client\" version) do not support being virtualized.  VMware Fusion 4.1 accidentally left out the code that prevents you from creating and running non-server Leopard and Snow Leopard VMs; version 4.1.1 was quickly released to restore the prevention code.  I have not heard great tales of success or failure running the non-server VMs under Fusion 4.1, but you can give it a try.  \nAll versions of Lion (10.7) support virtualization.  The Lion retail license includes permission to create 2 VMs in addition to the one real machine so long as you run them on Apple hardware. Specifically, section 2B(iii) grants a license:\n\n(iii) to install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or instances of the Apple Software within virtual operating system environments on each Mac Computer you own or control that is already running the Apple Software.\n\nNote that apparently Apple doesn't take this too seriously, as the official Lion licenses as posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/sla/ still require you to be running \"Snow Leopard\".\n\nA: Have you tried installing 10.6 as a VM?  Just wondering, because it sounds like the error message you're receiving is accurate.  You're running a 2006 MacBook Pro and as far as I know, the processors in those machines don't support hardware virtualization.  So VMware is just telling you that it doesn't support OS X in a VM on your machine.\nHowever, what would work would be installing Tiger on a separate partition.  Use disk utility to create a new volume and boot from the Tiger install disk, then install to that new volume and you can boot into it as needed.\n\nA: You are not allowed to run Mac OS in a VM (check the license). :)\n\nA: OS X Tiger can be installed in VMWare Fusion by creating a FreeBSD virtual machine. I am yet to find a way to install the FreeBSD version of VMWare Tools but its something I am working on. For the moment you can do basic stuff like surfing the web.\nSo its a case of creating a FreeBSD virtual machine and adjusting the settings prior to installing Tiger.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3379", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

It looks scary.\n\nA: Not a direct answer to your question, but you can also use \"Suspicious Package\", a QuickLook plug-in for Finder, to see what files a package installed: http://www.mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/\nDepending on what files were installed where, you may be able to find them in Finder and drag to the trash; otherwise you may have to go into Terminal and rm around.\n\nA: For the most part, Mac applications don't have uninstallers because they're rarely needed. You can almost always just toss the undesired offender into your trash.\n\nA: I recommend you try something like AppZapper ($) or \nAppCleaner (Freeware). There are others that work similarly.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3431", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}
{"text": "Q: Make an iPhone appear as different model? Is it possible to have a jailbroken iPhone trick an app into thinking you have a different device than the one you're on (e.g., a 3G passing as a 3GS)?\n\nA: Palm did this with the Pre: the device, like all devices, told iTunes it was an iPod and allowed only the syncing of non-DRM content over the USB connection. As to how the iPhone sorts out what it is to tell iTunes could either be hard-coded or come from a plist file somewhere in the OS. \nEither way, this forum is really not the place the find the answer to that question(nor do I think SO is either).

The iPhone 4 supports up to 10 hours of uninterrupted video playback OR up to 7 hours of talk time on 3G OR up to 6 hours of Internet use on 3G, for example.

{"text": "Q: Which text editor can I use with large files (>500 MB)? What are your recommendation for opening large text files on OS X? I found both BBEdit and Textmate to be struggling in this department.\n\nA: BBEdit is pretty much the standard for opening large text files on a Mac. I've opened some good-sized files with it, and BBEdit didn't even break a sweat. It is not entirely free - you do not have to pay for a license unless you want features that are in the pro activation above and beyond the free license.\nHow large of a file are you talking about? And how much RAM does your Mac have (both installed and free)?\n\nEdited to add\u2026\nBare Bones released BBEdit 9.6 today, and according to the Release Notes1 (under Changes):\n\nIt is now possible to open files significantly larger than before; the ceiling isn't unlimited, but it is no longer limited by the previously extant constraints in the OS.\n\nSounds to me like it's worth upgrading (free for anyone with BBEdit 9.x) and trying again.\n1 If you've never read a Bare Bones release notice before, you should. Even if you have no interest in BBEdit. Even if you have no interest in Bare Bones. Even if you have no interest in text editors in general. They're that good. Yes, really. I\u00e4! I\u00e4! Pnoies fhtagn!\n\nA: I'm using HexFiend to work with a 60 GB text file and it works great (apparently it can handle files as large as 118 GB).\n\nA: Check Sublime Text 2 out. It is one of the best out there. \n\nA: TextWrangler is a great tool for opening editing and saving large files. I wouldn't recommend if for copying and pasting large amounts of content though. Use it if you don't want to have to deal with the vi interface/commands. Like Loic mentioned, MacVim is a great app if you're more familar with vi.\nUse BBEdit for free now that TW is discontinued if needed.\n\nA: I found MacVim pretty good at opening large files.\nThere's even a plugin to speed it up, if the file is really large.\n(If you don't want to compile it yourself, you can download a DMG to install it pre-built.)\n\nA: If you are reading the file only, use the less command.  You can navigate and search through the file like vi, but much faster and without the nasty 'line too long' type problems.  For working with big production logs, this is an invaluable tool.\n\nA: If you are dealing with files over 2 GBs I recommend 010 Editor. It won't load the entire file in memory which means you can use it to open files larger than your available RAM and opening times will be much shorter (took about 20 seconds to open a 7GB file).\n\nA: For me, where BBEdit choked on 750MB, UltraEdit (not free) worked satisfactorily fast.\n\nA: My first choice is SlickEdit. It looks, well, is a bit old fashioned, but I have seen no other editor that deals with large files (even GBs of text) that fast, and still giving a ton of features.\nIt is not a modern IDE by current day standards, but a really powerful editor, and as said, the only one I ever used that really works with large files.\n\nA: http://code.google.com/p/macvim/ worked with a 1 gig file\nsearching file took about 1 min\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3437", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "59"}}
