{"text": "\\section{Introduction}\nLet $G$ be a simple undirected graph with the \\textit{vertex set} $V(G)$ and the \\textit{edge set} $E(G)$. A vertex with degree one is called a \\textit{pendant vertex}. The distance between the vertices $u$ and $v$ in graph $G$ is denoted by $d_G(u,v)$. A cycle $C$ is called \\textit{chordless} if $C$ has no \\textit{cycle chord} (that is an edge not in the edge set of $C$ whose endpoints lie on the vertices of $C$).\nThe \\textit{Induced subgraph} on vertex set $S$ is denoted by $\\langle S\\rangle$. A path that starts in $v$ and ends in $u$ is denoted by $\\stackrel\\frown{v u}$.\nA \\textit{traceable} graph is a graph that possesses a Hamiltonian path.\nIn a graph $G$, we say that a cycle $C$ is \\textit{formed by the path} $Q$ if $ | E(C) \\setminus E(Q) | = 1 $. So every vertex of $C$ belongs to $V(Q)$.\n\nIn 2011 the following conjecture was proposed:\n\\begin{conjecture}(Hoffmann-Ostenhof \\cite{hoffman})\nLet $G$ be a connected cubic graph. Then $G$ has a decomposition into a spanning tree, a matching and a family of cycles.\n\n\\end{conjecture}\nConjecture \\theconjecture$\\,$ also appears in Problem 516 \\cite{cameron}. There are a few partial results known for Conjecture \\theconjecture. Kostochka \\cite{kostocha} noticed that the Petersen graph, the prisms over cycles, and many other graphs have a decomposition desired in Conjecture \\theconjecture. Ozeki and Ye \\cite{ozeki} proved that the conjecture holds for 3-connected cubic plane graphs. Furthermore, it was proved by Bachstein \\cite{bachstein} that Conjecture \\theconjecture$\\,$ is true for every 3-connected cubic graph embedded in torus or Klein-bottle. Akbari, Jensen and Siggers \\cite[Theorem 9]{akbari} showed that Conjecture \\theconjecture$\\,$ is true for Hamiltonian cubic graphs.\n\nIn this paper, we show that Conjecture \\theconjecture$\\,$ holds for traceable cubic graphs.\n\\section{Results}\nBefore proving the main result, we need the following lemma.\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{lemma:1}\nLet $G$ be a cubic graph. Suppose that $V(G)$ can be partitioned into a tree $T$ and finitely many cycles such that there is no edge between any pair of cycles (not necessarily distinct cycles), and every pendant vertex of $T$ is adjacent to at least one vertex of a cycle. Then, Conjecture \\theconjecture$\\,$ holds for $G$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}\nBy assumption, every vertex of each cycle in the partition is adjacent to exactly one vertex of $T$. Call the set of all edges with one endpoint in a cycle and another endpoint in $T$ by $Q$.\nClearly, the induced subgraph on $E(T) \\cup Q$ is a spanning tree of $G$. We call it $T'$. Note that every edge between a pendant vertex of $T$ and the union of cycles in the partition is also contained in $T'$. Thus, every pendant vertex of $T'$ is contained in a cycle of the partition. Now, consider the graph $H = G \\setminus E(T')$. For every $v \\in V(T)$, $d_H(v) \\leq 1$. So Conjecture \\theconjecture$\\,$ holds for $G$. \\vspace{1em}\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Remark 1.}\n\\label{remark:1}\nLet $C$ be a cycle formed by the path $Q$. Then clearly there exists a chordless cycle formed by $Q$.\n\nNow, we are in a position to prove the main result.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\nConjecture \\theconjecture$\\,$ holds for traceable cubic graphs.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $G$ be a traceable cubic graph and $P : v_1, \\dots, v_n$ be a Hamiltonian path in $G$. By \\cite[Theorem 9]{akbari}, Conjecture A holds for $v_1 v_n  \\in E(G)$. Thus we can assume that $v_1 v_n  \\notin E(G)$. Let $v_1 v_j, v_1 v_{j'}, v_i v_n, v_{i'} v_n \\in E(G)\\setminus E(P)$  and $j' < j < n$, $1 < i < i'$. Two cases can occur:\n\\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0pt,label=]\n\\item\n\\textbf{Case 1.}\nAssume that $i < j$. Consider the following graph in Figure \\ref{fig:overlapping} in which the thick edges denote the path $P$. Call the three paths between $v_j$ and $v_i$, from the left to the right, by $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$, respectively (note that $P_1$ contains the edge $e'$ and $P_3$ contains the edge $e$).\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=40mm]{engImages/overlapping.pdf}\n    \\caption{Paths $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$}\n    \\label{fig:overlapping}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIf $P_2$ has order $2$, then $G$ is Hamiltonian and so by \\cite[Theorem 9]{akbari} Conjecture \\theconjecture$\\,$ holds. Thus we can assume that $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$ have order at least $3$. Now, consider the following subcases:\\\\\n\n\\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0pt,label=]\n\\label{case:1}\n\\item \\textbf{Subcase 1.} There is no edge between $V(P_r)$ and $V(P_s)$ for $1 \\leq r < s \\leq 3$.

Let $v_j=w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_l=a$ be all vertices of the path $\\stackrel\\frown{v_j a}$ in $P_1$. Choose the shortest path $w_0 w_{i_1} w_{i_2} \\dots w_l$ such that $0 < i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < l$.\nDefine a tree $T$ whose edge set is the thin edges in Figure \\ref{fig:deltaCycle}.\\\\\nCall the cycle $w_0 w_{i_1} \\dots w_l \\stackrel\\frown{b w_0}$ by $C'$.

Note that there exists a path of order $2$ in $C'$ which by adding this path to $Q_i$ we find a cycle $C_{t_i}$, for some $i$. Hence there exists an edge $e_{t_i}$ connecting $Q_i$ to $V(G) \\setminus V(P_1)$.

The piezoresistive elements are either released from, or kept on, the substrate. The sensitivity ($S$) of the sensors is defined based on the ratio of the relative resistance change ($\\Delta R/R$) of the sensing element and the strain applied to the substrate ($\\varepsilon_{sub}$):\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\nS = (\\Delta R/R)/\\varepsilon_{sub}\r\n\\label{eq:sensitivity}\r\n\\end{equation}\r\nIn addition, the relative resistance change $\\Delta R/R$ can be calculated from the gauge factor ($GF$) of the material used to make the piezoresistive elements: $\\Delta R/R = GF \\varepsilon_{ind}$, where $\\varepsilon_{ind}$ is the strain induced into the piezoresistor. In most of the conventional strain gauges as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:fig1} (a,b), the thickness of the sensing layer is typically below a few hundred nanometers, which is much smaller than that of the substrate. Therefore, the strain induced into the piezoresistive elements is approximately the same as that of the substrate ($\\varepsilon_{ind} \\approx \\varepsilon_{sub}$). Consequently, to improve the sensitivity of strain sensors (e.g. enlarging $\\Delta R/R$), electrical approaches which can enlarge the gauge factor ($GF$) are required. Nevertheless, as aforementioned, the existence of the large gauge factor in nanowires due to quantum confinement or surface state, is still considered as controversial. \n\r\nIt is also evident from Eq. \\ref{eq:sensitivity} that the sensitivity of strain sensors can also be improved using a mechanical approach, which enlarges the strain induced into the piezoresistive element. Figure \\ref{fig:fig1}(c) shows our proposed nano strain-amplifier structure, in which the piezoresistive nanowires are locally fabricated at the centre of a released bridge. The key idea of this structure is that, under a certain strain applied to the substrate, a large strain will be concentrated at the locally fabricated SiC nanowires. The working principle of the nano strain-amplifier is similar to that of the well-known dogbone structure, which is widely used to characterize the tensile strength of materials \\cite{dogbone1,dogbone2}. That is, when a stress is applied to the dogbone-shape of a certain material, a crack, if generated, will occur at the middle part of the dogbone. The large strain concentrated at the narrow area located at the centre part with respect to the wider areas located at outer region, causes the crack. Qualitative and quantitative explanations of the nano strain-amplifier are presented as follows.  \r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity, the released micro frame and nanowire (single wire or array) of the nano strain-amplifier can be considered as solid springs, Fig. \\ref{fig:fig1}(d). The stiffness of these springs are proportional to their width ($w$) and inversely proportional to their length (l): $K \\propto w/l$. Consequently, the model of the released nanowire and micro frames can be simplified as a series of springs, where the springs with higher stiffness correspond to the micro frame, and the single spring with lower stiffness corresponds to the nanowire. It is well-known in classical physics that, for serially connected springs, a larger strain will be concentrated in the low--stiffness string, while a smaller strain will be induced in the high--stiffness string \\cite{Springbook}. The following analysis quantitatively explained the amplification of the strain.\t\r\n\r\n\\begin{figure}[b!]\r\n\t\\centering\r\n\t\\includegraphics[width=3in]{Fig2}\r\n\t\\vspace{-1em}\r\n\t\\caption{Finite element analysis of the strain induced in to the nanowire array utilizing nano strain-amplifier.}\r\n\t\\label{fig:fig2}\r\n\\end{figure}\r\nWhen a tensile mechanical strain ($\\varepsilon_{sub}$) is applied to the substrate, the released structure will also be elongated. Since the stiffness of the released frame is much smaller than that of the substrate, it is safe to assume that the released structure will follows the elongation of the substrate. The displacement of the released structure $\\Delta L$ is:\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\\Delta L = \\Delta L_m + \\Delta L_n = L_m \\varepsilon_m + L_n \\varepsilon_n\r\n\\label{eq:displacement}\r\n\\end{equation} \r\nwhere $L_m$, $L_n$ are the length; $\\Delta L_m$, $\\Delta L_n$ are the displacement; and $\\varepsilon_m$, $\\varepsilon_n$ are the strains induced into the micro spring and nano spring, respectively. The subscripts m and n stand for the micro frames and nanowires, respectively. Furthermore, due to the equilibrium of the stressing force ($F$) along the series of springs, the following relationship is established: $F= K_m\\Delta L_m = K_n \\Delta L_n$, where $K_m$, $K_n$ are the stiffness of the released micro frames and nanowires, respectively. Consequently the relationship between the displacement of the micro frame (higher stiffness) and nanowires (lower stiffness) is:\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\\frac{\\Delta L_m}{\\Delta L_n}=\\frac{K_n}{K_m}=\\frac{L_mw_n}{L_nw_m}\r\n\\label{eq:euili}\r\n\\end{equation}\r\nSubstituting Eqn. \\ref{eq:euili} into Eqn. \\ref{eq:displacement}, the strain induced into the locally fabricated nanowires is:\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\\varepsilon_n = \\frac{\\Delta L_n}{L_n} = \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{w_m-w_n}{w_m}\\frac{L_m}{L}}\\varepsilon_{sub}\r\n\\label{eq:strainamp}\r\n\\end{equation} \r\n\r\nEquation \\ref{eq:strainamp} indicates that increasing the ratio of $w_m/w_n$ and $L_m/L_n$ significantly amplifies the strain induced into the nanowire from the strain applied to the substrate. This model is also applicable to the case of nanowire arrays, in which $w_n$ is the total width of all nanowires in the array.\n\r\nThe theoretical model is then verified using the finite element analysis (FEA). In the FEA simulation, we compare the strain induced into (i) non released nanowires, (ii) the conventionally released nanowires, and (iii) our nano strain-amplifier structure, using COMSOL Multiphysics \\texttrademark. In our nano strain amplifying structure, the width of the released frame was set to be 8 $\\mu$m, while the width of each nanowire in the array (3 wires) was set to be 370 nm. The nanowires array structure was selected as it can enhance the electrical conductance of the SiC nanowires resistor which makes the subsequent experimental demonstration easier. The ratio between the length of nanowires and micro bridge was set to be 1: 20. With this geometrical dimensions, strain induced into nanowires array $\\varepsilon_n$ was numerically calculated to be approximately 6 times larger than $\\varepsilon_{sub}$, Eqn. \\ref{eq:strainamp}. The simulation results show that for all structure, the elongation of non-released and released nanowires follow that of the substrate. In addition, strain was almost completely transferred into conventional released and non-released structures. Furthermore, the ratio of the strain induced in to the locally fabricated nanowires was estimated to be 5.9 times larger than that of the substrate, Fig. \\ref{fig:fig2}. These results are in solid agreement with the theoretical analysis presented above. For a nanowire array with an average width of 470 nm, the amplified gain of strain was found to be 4.5.   \t\r\n\r\nBased on the theoretical analysis, we conducted the following experiments to demonstrate the high sensitivity of SiC nanowire strain sensors using the nano strain-amplifier. A thin 3C-SiC film with its thickness of 300 nm was epitaxially grown on a 150 mm diameter Si wafer using low pressure chemical vapour deposition \\cite{SiC_growth}. The film was \\emph{in situ} doped using Al dopants. The carrier concentration of the p-type 3C-SiC was found to be $5 \\times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, using a hot probe technique \\cite{philip}. The details of the characteristics of the grown film can be found elsewhere \\cite{Phan_JMC}. Subsequently, I-shape p-type SiC resistors with aluminum electrodes deposited on the surface were patterned using inductive coupled plasma (ICP) etching. As the piezoresistance of p-type 3C-SiC depends on crystallographic orientation, all SiC resistors of the present work were aligned along [110] direction to maximize the piezoresistive effect. Next, the micro scale SiC resistors were then released from the Si substrate using dry etching (XeF$_2$). Finally, SiC nanowire arrays were formed at the centre of the released bridge using focused ion beam (FIB). Two types of nanowire array were fabricated with three nanowires for each array. The average width of each nanowire in each type were 380 nm and 470 nm, respectively. Figure \\ref{fig:fig3} shows the SEM images of the fabricated samples, including the conventional released structure, non-released nanowires, and the nano strain-amplifier.  \r\n\r\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\r\n\t\\centering\r\n\t\\includegraphics[width=3in]{Fig3}\r\n\t\\caption{SEM image of SiC strain sensors.

The linear relationship between the applied voltage and measured current, indicated that Al made a good Ohmic contact with the highly doped SiC resistance, Fig. \\ref{fig:IV}. Additionally, the electrical conductivity of both nanowires and micro frame estimated from the I-V curve and the dimensions of the resistors shows almost the same value. This indicated that the FIB process did not cause a significant surface damage to the fabricated nanowires.    \r\n\t\r\n\\begin{figure}[b!]\r\n\t\\centering\r\n\t\\includegraphics[width=3in]{Fig4}\r\n\t\t\\vspace{-1.5em}\r\n\t\\caption{Current voltage curves of the fabricated SiC resistors.}\r\n\t\\label{fig:IV}\r\n\n\\end{figure}\r\n\r\nThe bending experiment was used to characterize the piezoresistive effect in micro size SiC resistors and locally fabricated SiC nanowire array. In this experiment one end of the Si cantilever (with a thickness of 625 $\\mu$m, and a width of 7 mm) was fixed while the other end was deflected by applying different forces. The distance from the fabricated nanowires to the free end of the Si cantilever was approximately 45 mm. The strain induced into the Si substrate is $\\varepsilon_\\text{sub} = Mt/2EI$, where $M$ is the applied bending moment; and $t$, $E$ and $I$ are the thickness, Young's modulus and the moment of inertia of the Si cantilever, respectively. The response of the SiC resistance to applied strain was then measured using a multimeter (Agilent \\texttrademark 34401 A).\n\r\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\r\n\t\\centering\r\n\t\\includegraphics[width=3in]{Fig5.eps}\r\n\t\t\\vspace{-1.5em}\r\n\t\\caption{Experimental results.

For all fabricated samples, the relative resistance change shows a good linear relationship with the applied strain ($\\varepsilon_{sub}$). In addition, with the same applied strain to the Si substrate, the resistance change of the SiC nanowires using the nano strain-amplifier was much larger than that of the the SiC micro resistor and the conventional non-released SiC nanowires. In addition, reducing the width of the SiC nanowires also resulted in the increase of the sensitivity. The magnitude of the piezoresistive effect in the nano strain-amplifier as well as conventional structures were then quantitatively evaluated based on the effective gauge factor ($GF_{eff}$), which is defined as the ratio of the relative resistance change to the applied strain to the substrate: $GF_{eff} = (\\Delta R/R)/\\varepsilon_{sub}$. Accordingly, the effective gauge factor of the released micro SiC was found to be 28, while that of the non-released SiC nanowires was 35. From the data shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:DRR}, the effective gauge factor of the 380 nm and 470 nm SiC nanowires in the nano strain-amplifier were calculated as 150 and 124, respectively. Thus for nanowire arrays with average widths of 380 nm and 470 nm, the sensitivity of the nano strain-amplifier was 5.4 times and 4.6 times larger than the bulk SiC, respectively. These results were consistent with analytical and numerical models presented above. The relative resistance change of the nano strain-amplifier also showed excellent linearity with the applied strain, with a linear regression of above 99\\%. \r\n\r\nThe resistance change of the nano strain-amplifier can also be converted into voltage signals using a Wheatstone bridge, Fig. \\ref{fig:DRR}(b). The output voltage of the nano strain-amplifier increases with increasing tensile strains from 0 ppm to 180 ppm, and returned to the initial value when the strain was completely removed, confirming a good repeatability after several strain induced cycles. The linearity of the relative resistance change, and the repeatability indicate that the proposed structure is promising for strain sensing applications.\r\n    \r\nIn conclusion, this work presents a novel mechanical approach to obtain highly sensitive piezoresistance in nanowires based on a nano strain-amplifier. The key factor of the nano strain-amplifier lies on nanowires locally fabricated on a released micro structure. Experimental studies were conducted on SiC nanowires, confirming that by utilizing our nano strain-amplifier, the sensitivity of SiC nanowires was 5.4 times larger than that of conventional structures. This result indicated that the nano strain-amplifier is an excellent platform for ultra sensitive strain sensing applications.    \r\n\r\n\r\n", "meta": {"timestamp": "2016-07-18T02:07:38", "yymm": "1607", "arxiv_id": "1607.04531", "language": "en", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04531"}}
{"text": "\\section{Introduction}\\label{intro}\n\nGas has a fundamental role in shaping the evolution of galaxies,\nthrough its accretion on to massive haloes, cooling and subsequent\nfuelling of star formation, to the triggering of extreme luminous\nactivity around super massive black holes. Determining how the\nphysical state of gas in galaxies changes as a function of redshift is\ntherefore crucial to understanding how these processes evolve over\ncosmological time. The standard model of the gaseous interstellar\nmedium (ISM) in galaxies comprises a thermally bistable medium\n(\\citealt*{Field:1969}) of dense ($n \\sim 100$\\,cm$^{-3}$) cold\nneutral medium (CNM) structures, with kinetic temperatures of $T_{\\rm\n  k} \\sim 100$\\,K, embedded within a lower-density ($n \\sim\n1$\\,cm$^{-3}$) warm neutral medium (WNM) with $T_{\\rm k} \\sim\n10^{4}$\\,K. The WNM shields the cold gas and is in turn ionized by\nbackground cosmic rays and soft X-rays (e.g. \\citealt{Wolfire:1995,\n  Wolfire:2003}). A further hot ($T_{\\rm k} \\sim 10^{6}$\\,K) ionized\ncomponent was introduced into the model by \\cite{McKee:1977}, to\naccount for heating by supernova-driven shocks within the inter-cloud\nmedium. In the local Universe, this paradigm has successfully\nwithstood decades of observational scrutiny, although there is some\nevidence (e.g. \\citealt{Heiles:2003b}; \\citealt*{Roy:2013b};\n\\citealt{Murray:2015}) that a significant fraction of the WNM may\nexist at temperatures lower than expected for global conditions of\nstability, requiring additional dynamical processes to maintain local\nthermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nSince atomic hydrogen (\\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}}) is one of the most abundant\ncomponents of the neutral ISM and readily detectable through either\nthe 21\\,cm or Lyman $\\alpha$ lines, it is often used as a tracer of\nthe large-scale distribution and physical state of neutral gas in\ngalaxies. The 21\\,cm line has successfully been employed in surveying\nthe neutral ISM in the Milky Way\n(e.g. \\citealt{McClure-Griffiths:2009,Murray:2015}), the Local Group\n(e.g. \\citealt{Kim:2003,Bruns:2005,Braun:2009,Gratier:2010}) and\nlow-redshift Universe (see \\citealt{Giovanelli:2016} for a\nreview). However, beyond $z \\sim 0.4$ (\\citealt{Fernandez:2016})\n\\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} emission from individual galaxies becomes too faint\nto be detectable by current 21\\,cm surveys and so we must rely on\nabsorption against suitably bright background radio (21\\,cm) or UV\n(Lyman-$\\alpha$) continuum sources to probe the cosmological evolution\nof \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}}. The bulk of neutral gas is contained in\nhigh-column-density damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs, $N_{\\rm HI}\n\\geq 2 \\times 10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$; see \\citealt*{Wolfe:2005} for a\nreview), which at $z \\gtrsim 1.7$ are detectable in the optical\nspectra of quasars. Studies of DLAs provide evidence that the atomic\ngas in the distant Universe appears to be consistent with a\nmulti-phase neutral ISM similar to that seen in the Local Group\n(e.g. \\citealt*{Lane:2000}; \\citealt*{Kanekar:2001c};\n\\citealt*{Wolfe:2003b}). However, there is some variation in the cold\nand warm fractions measured throughout the DLA population\n(e.g. \\citealt*{Howk:2005}; \\citealt{Srianand:2005, Lehner:2008};\n\\citealt*{Jorgenson:2010}; \\citealt{Carswell:2011, Carswell:2012,\n  Kanekar:2014a}; \\citealt*{Cooke:2015}; \\citealt*{Neeleman:2015}).\n\nThe 21-cm spin temperature affords us an important line-of-enquiry in\nunraveling the physical state of high-redshift atomic gas. This\nquantity is sensitive to the processes that excite the ground-state of\n\\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} in the ISM\n(\\citealt{Purcell:1956,Field:1958,Field:1959b,Bahcall:1969}) and\ntherefore dictates the detectability of the 21\\,cm line in absorption.\nIn the CNM the spin temperature is governed by collisional excitation\nand so is driven to the kinetic temperature, while the lower densities\nin the WNM mean that the 21\\,cm transition is not thermalized by\ncollisions between the hydrogen atoms, and so photo-excitation by the\nbackground Ly $\\alpha$ radiation field becomes important. Consequently\nthe spin temperature in the WNM is lower than the kinetic temperature,\nin the range $\\sim$1000 -- 5000\\,K depending on the column density and\nnumber of multi-phase components (\\citealt{Liszt:2001}). Importantly,\nthe spin temperature measured from a single detection of extragalactic\nabsorption is equal to the harmonic mean of the spin temperature in\nindividual gas components, weighted by their column densities, thereby\nproviding a method of inferring the CNM fraction in high-redshift\nsystems.\n\nSurveys for 21\\,cm absorption in known redshifted DLAs have been used\nto simultaneously measure the column density and spin temperature of\n\\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} (see \\citealt{Kanekar:2014a} and references\ntherein). There is some evidence for an increase (at $4\\,\\sigma$\nsignificance) in the spin temperature of DLAs at redshifts above $z =\n2.4$, and a difference (at $6\\,\\sigma$ significance) between the\ndistribution of spin temperatures in DLAs and the Milky Way\n(\\citealt{Kanekar:2014a}). The implication that at least 90\\,per\\,cent\nof high-redshift DLAs may have CNM fractions significantly less than\nthat measured for the Milky Way has important consequences for the\nheating and cooling of neutral gas in the early Universe and star\nformation (e.g. \\citealt*{Wolfe:2003a}). However, these targeted\nobservations rely on the limited availability of simultaneous 21\\,cm\nand optical/UV data for the DLAs and assumes commonality between the\ncolumn density probed by the optical and radio sight-lines. The first\nissue can be overcome by improving the sample statistics through\nlarger 21\\,cm line surveys of high-redshift DLAs, but the latter\nrequires improvements to our methodology and understanding of the gas\ndistribution in these systems. There are also concerns about the\naccuracy to which the fraction of the source structure subtended by\nthe absorber can be measured in each system, which can only be\nresolved through spectroscopic very long baseline interferometry\n(VLBI). It has been suggested that the observed evolution in spin\ntemperature could be biased by assumptions about the radio-source\ncovering factor (\\citealt{Curran:2005}) and its behaviour as a\nfunction of redshift (\\citealt{Curran:2006b, Curran:2012b}).\n\nIn this paper we consider an approach using the statistical constraint\non the average spin temperature achievable with future large 21\\,cm\nsurveys using precursor telescopes to the Square Kilometre Array\n(SKA). This will enable independent verification of the evolution in\nspin temperature at high redshift and provide a method of studying the\nglobal properties of neutral gas below $z \\approx 1.7$, where the\nLyman\\,$\\alpha$ line is inaccessible using ground-based observatories.\nIn an early attempt at a genuinely blind 21\\,cm absorption survey,\n\\cite{Darling:2011} used pilot data from the Arecibo Legacy Fast\nArecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFALFA) survey to obtain upper limits on\nthe column density frequency distribution from 21\\,cm absorption at\nlow redshift ($z \\lesssim 0.06$). However, they also noted that the\nnumber of detections could be used to make inferences about the ratio\nof the spin temperature to covering factor. Building upon this work,\n\\cite{Wu:2015} found that their upper limits on the frequency\ndistribution function measured from the 40\\,per\\,cent ALFALFA survey\n({$\\alpha$}.40; \\citealt{Haynes:2011}) could only be reconciled with\nmeasurements from other low-redshift 21\\,cm surveys if the typical\nspin temperature to covering factor ratio was greater than 500\\,K. At\nhigher redshifts, \\cite{Gupta:2009} found that the number density of\n21\\,cm absorbers in known \\mbox{Mg\\,{\\sc ii}} absorbers appeared to\ndecrease with redshift above $z \\sim 1$, consistent with a reduction\nin the CNM fraction. We pursue this idea further by investigating\nwhether future wide-field 21\\,cm surveys can be used to measure the\naverage spin temperature in distant galaxies that are rich in atomic\ngas.\n\n\\section{The expected number of intervening \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}}\n  absorbers}\\label{section:expected_number}\n\nWe estimate the expected number of intervening \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}}\nsystems towards a sample of background radio sources by evaluating the\nfollowing integral over all sight-lines\n\\begin{equation}\\label{equation:expected_number}\n  \\mu =  \\iint{f(N_{\\rm HI},X)\\,\\mathrm{d}X\\,\\mathrm{d}N_{\\rm HI}}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $f(N_{\\rm HI}, X)$ is the frequency distribution as a function\nof column density ($N_{\\rm HI}$) and comoving path length ($X$). We\nuse the results of recent surveys for 21\\,cm emission in nearby\ngalaxies (e.g. \\citealt{Zwaan:2005}) and high-redshift Lyman-$\\alpha$\nabsorption in the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey (SDSS;\ne.g. \\citealt*{Prochaska:2005}; \\citealt{Noterdaeme:2009}), which show\nthat $f(N_{\\rm HI}, X)$ can be parametrized by a gamma function of the\nform\n\\begin{equation}\n  f(N_{\\rm HI}, X) = \\left({f_{\\ast} \\over N_{\\ast}}\\right)\\left({N_{\\rm HI} \\over N_{\\ast}}\\right)^{-\\beta}\\exp{\\left(-{N_{\\rm HI} \\over N_{\\ast}}\\right)}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $f_{\\ast} = 0.0193$, $\\log_{10}(N_{\\ast}) = 21.2$ and $\\beta =\n1.24$ at $z = 0$ (\\citealt{Zwaan:2005}), and $f_{\\ast} = 0.0324$,\n$\\log_{10}(N_{\\ast}) = 21.26$ and $\\beta = 1.27$ at $z \\approx 3$\n(\\citealt{Noterdaeme:2009}). While the observational data do not yet\nconstrain models for evolution of the \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} distribution\nat intermediate redshifts between $z \\sim 0.1$ and\n$3$\\footnote{Measurements of $f(N_{\\rm HI},X)$ at intermediate\n  redshifts come from targeted ultra-violet surveys of DLAs using the\n  \\emph{Hubble Space Telescope} (\\citealt*{Rao:2006};\n  \\citealt{Neeleman:2016}). However, due to the limited sample sizes\n  these are currently an order-of-magnitude less sensitive than the\n  nearby 21-cm and high-redshift optical Lyman-$\\alpha$ surveys.}, it\nis known to be much weaker than the significant decline seen in the\nglobal star-formation rate and molecular gas over the same epoch\n(e.g. \\citealt{Lagos:2014}). We therefore carry out a simple linear\ninterpolation between the low and high redshift epochs to estimate\n$f(N_{\\rm HI},X)$ as a function of redshift.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.475\\textwidth]{width_dist.pdf}\n\\caption{The distribution of 21\\,cm line widths based on existing\n  detections of intervening absorption at $z > 0.1$ (see the text for\n  details of this sample).

However, direct measurement\nof the \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} covering factor is significantly more\ndifficult and so for the purposes of this work we draw random samples\nassuming a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. In\n\\autoref{figure:covfact_dist}, we show a comparison between this\nassumption and the sample distribution estimated by\n\\cite{Kanekar:2014a} from their main sample of 37 quasars. Kanekar et\nal. used VLBI synthesis imaging to measure the fraction of total\nquasar flux density contained within the core, which was then used as\na proxy for the covering factor. By carrying out a two-tailed\nKolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test of the hypothesis that the Kanekar et\nal. data are consistent with our assumed uniform distribution, we find\nthat this hypothesis is rejected at the 0.05 level, but not at the\n0.01 level (this outcome is dominated by the paucity of quasars in the\nsample with $c_{\\rm f} \\lesssim 0.2$). It is therefore possible that\nthe population distribution of \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} covering factors may\ndeviate somewhat from the uniform distribution assumed in this\nwork. We discuss the implications of this further in\n\\autoref{section:covering_factor}.\n\n\\section{A 21\\,cm absorption survey with\n  ASKAP}\\label{section:all_sky_survey}\n\nWe use the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP;\n\\citealt{Johnston:2007}) as a case study to demonstrate the expected\nresults from planned wide-field surveys for 21\\,cm absorption\n(e.g. the ASKAP First Large Absorption Survey in \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} --\nSadler et al., the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey -- Gupta et al., and\nthe Search for HI absorption with AperTIF -- Morganti et al.). ASKAP\nis currently undergoing commissioning. Proof-of-concept observations\nwith the Boolardy Engineering Test Array (\\citealt{Hotan:2014}) have\nalready been used to successfully detect a new \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}}\nabsorber associated with a probable young radio galaxy at $z = 0.44$\n(\\citealt{Allison:2015a}). Here we predict the outcome of a future\n2\\,h-per-pointing survey of the entire southern sky ($\\delta \\leq\n+10\\degr$) using the full 36-antenna ASKAP in a single 304\\,MHz band\nbetween 711.5 and 1015.5\\,MHz, equivalent to \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}}\nredshifts between $z = 0.4$ and 1.0.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.475\\textwidth]{nsources_flux.pdf}\n\\caption{The number of radio sources in our simulated southern sky\n  survey ($\\delta \\leq +10\\degr$) estimated from existing catalogues\n  at $L$-band frequencies (see the text for details).

We estimate the noise per spectral channel\nusing the radiometer equation\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\sigma_{\\rm chan} =  {S_{\\rm system} \\over \\sqrt{n_{\\rm pol}\\,n_{\\rm ant}\\,(n_{\\rm ant} - 1)\\,\\Delta{t}_{\\rm in}\\,\\Delta{\\nu}_{\\rm chan}}}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $S_{\\rm system}$ is the system equivalent flux density, $n_{\\rm\n  pol}$ is the number of polarizations, $n_{\\rm ant}$ is the number of\nantennas, $\\Delta{t}_{\\rm in}$ is the on-source integration time and\n$\\Delta{\\nu}_{\\rm chan}$ is the spectral resolution in frequency. The\nsensitivity of the telescope in the 711.5 - 1015.5\\,MHz band is\nexpected to vary between $S_{\\rm system} \\approx 3200$ and $2000$\\,Jy,\nwith the largest change in sensitivity between 700 and 800\\,MHz. ASKAP\nhas dual linear polarization feeds, 36 antennas and a fine filter bank\nthat produces 16\\,416 independent channels across the full 304\\,MHz\nbandwidth, so the expected noise per 18.5\\,kHz channel in a 2\\,h\nobservation is approximately 5.5 - 3.5\\,mJy\\,beam$^{-1}$ across the\nband. In the case of an actual survey, the true sensitivity will of\ncourse be recorded in the spectral data as a function of redshift (see\ne.g. \\citealt{Allison:2015a}), but for the purposes of the simulated\nsurvey presented in this work we split the band into several frequency\nbins to capture the variation in sensitivity and velocity resolution\n(which is in the range 7.8\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ at 711.5\\,MHz to\n5.5\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ at 1015.5\\,MHz).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.475\\textwidth]{zdist.pdf}\n\\caption{The distribution of CENSORS sources (\\citealt{Brookes:2008})\n  brighter than 10\\,mJy beyond a given redshift $z$.

The source flux\ndensities, used to calculate the optical depth limit in\n\\autoref{equation:optical_depth_limit}, are estimated at the centre of\neach frequency bin by extrapolating from the catalogue values and\nassuming a canonical spectral index of $\\alpha = -0.7$. In\n\\autoref{figure:nsources_flux}, we show the resulting cumulative\ndistribution of radio sources in our sample as a function of flux\ndensity across the band.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.475\\textwidth]{nsources_tau.pdf}\n\\caption{The number of sources in our simulated ASKAP survey with a\n  21\\,cm opacity sensitivity greater than or equal to\n  $\\tau_{5\\sigma}$, as defined by\n  \\autoref{equation:optical_depth_limit}.

Random\n  samples for the line FWHM and covering factor were drawn from the\n  distributions shown in \\autoref{figure:width_dist} and\n  \\autoref{figure:covfact_dist}.}\\label{figure:nsources_tau}\n\\end{figure}\n  \nFor any given sight-line, the redshift interval over which absorption\nmay be detected is dependent upon the distance to the continuum\nsource. The lack of accurate spectroscopic redshift measurements for\nmost radio sources over the sky necessitates the use of a statistical\napproach based on a model for the source redshift distribution. We\ntherefore apply a statistical weighting to each comoving path element\n$\\delta{X}(z)$ such that the expected number of absorber detections is\nnow given by\n\\begin{equation}\\label{equation:weighted_sum_number}\n  \\mu =  \\iint{f(N_{\\rm HI},X)\\,\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm src}(z^{\\prime} \\geq z)\\,\\mathrm{d}X\\,\\mathrm{d}N_{\\rm HI}}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\mathcal{F}_{\\rm src}(z^{\\prime} \\geq z) = {\\int_{z}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{N}_{\\rm src}(z^{\\prime})\\mathrm{d}z^{\\prime}\\over\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\mathcal{N}_{\\rm src} (z^{\\prime})\\mathrm{d}z^{\\prime}},\n\\end{equation}\nand $\\mathcal{N}_{\\rm src}(z)$ is the number of radio sources as a\nfunction of redshift. To estimate $\\mathcal{N}_{\\rm src}(z)$ we use\nthe Combined EIS-NVSS Survey Of Radio Sources (CENSORS;\n\\citealt{Brookes:2008}), which forms a complete sample of radio\nsources brighter than 7.2\\,mJy at 1.4\\,GHz with spectroscopic\nredshifts out to cosmological distances. In \\autoref{figure:zdist} we\nshow the distribution of CENSORS sources brighter than 10\\,mJy beyond\na given redshift $z$, and the corresponding analytical function\nderived from the model fit of \\citet{deZotti:2010}, given by\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\mathcal{N}_{\\rm src}(z) \\approx 1.29 + 32.37z - 32.89z^{2} + 11.13z^{3} - 1.25z^{4},\n\\end{equation}\nwhich we use in our analysis. For the redshifts spanned by our\nsimulated ASKAP survey, the fraction of background sources evolves\nfrom 87\\,per\\,cent at $z = 0.4$ to 53\\,per\\,cent at $z = 1.0$.\n\nWe assume that this redshift distribution applies to any sight-line\nirrespective of the continuum flux density. However, this assumption\nis only true if the source population in the target sample evolves\nsuch that the effect of distance is nullified by an increase in\nluminosity. Given this criterion, and the sensitivity of our simulated\nsurvey, we limit our sample to sources with flux densities between 10\nand 1000\\,mJy, which are dominated by the rapidly evolving population\nof high-excitation radio galaxies and quasars\n(e.g. \\citealt{Jackson:1999, Best:2012, Best:2014, Pracy:2016}) and\nfor which the redshift distribution is known to be almost independent\nof flux density (e.g. \\citealt{Condon:1984, Condon:1998}). In\n\\autoref{figure:nsources_tau}, we show the number of sources from this\nsub-sample as a function of opacity sensitivity [as defined by\n\\autoref{equation:optical_depth_limit}], drawing random samples of the\nline FWHM and covering factor from the distributions shown in\n\\autoref{figure:width_dist} and \\autoref{figure:covfact_dist}. There\nare approximately 190\\,000 sightlines with sufficient sensitivity to\ndetect absorption of optical depth greater than $\\tau_{5\\sigma}\n\\approx 1.0$ and 25\\,000 sensitive to optical depths greater than\n$\\tau_{5\\sigma} \\approx 0.1$. Since this distribution converges at\noptical depth sensitivities greater than $\\tau_{5\\sigma} \\approx 5$,\nthe population of sources fainter than 10\\,mJy, which are excluded\nfrom our simulated ASKAP survey, would not significantly contribute to\nfurther detections of absorption. Similarly, while sources brighter\nthan 1\\,Jy are good probes of low-column-density \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}}\ngas, they do not constitute a sufficiently large enough population to\nsignificantly affect the total number of absorber detections expected\nin the survey and can also be safely excluded.\n\nBased on these assumptions, we can estimate the number of absorbers we\nwould expect to detect in our survey with ASKAP as a function of spin\ntemperature. In \\autoref{figure:ndetections_nhi}, we show the expected\ndetection yield as a cumulative function of column density. We show\nresults for two scenarios where the spin temperature is fixed at a\nsingle value of either 100 or 1000\\,K, and the line FWHM and covering\nfactors are drawn from the random distributions shown in\n\\autoref{figure:width_dist} and \\autoref{figure:covfact_dist}. We find\nthat for both these cases the expected number of detections is not\nsensitive to column densities below the DLA definition of $N_{\\rm HI}\n= 2\\times 10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. We also show in\n\\autoref{figure:ndetections_total} the expected total detection yield\n(integrated over all \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} column densities) as a function\nof a single spin temperature $T_\\mathrm{spin}$ and line FWHM\n$\\Delta{v}_\\mathrm{50}$. We find that for typical spin temperatures of\na few hundred kelvin (consistent with the typical fraction of CNM\nobserved in the local Universe) and a line FWHM of approximately\n$20$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$, a wide-field 21\\,cm survey with ASKAP is expected\nto yield $\\sim 1000$ detections. However, even moderate evolution to a\nhigher spin temperature in the DLA population should see significant\nreduction in the detection yield from this survey.\n\n\\section{Inferring the average spin\n  temperature}\\label{section:spin_temp}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.475\\textwidth]{ndetections_nhi.pdf}\n\\caption{The expected number of absorber detections (as a cumulative\n  function of column density) in our simulated ASKAP survey. We show\n  two scenarios for a single spin temperature $T_{\\rm spin} = 100$ and\n  $1000$\\,K, where we have drawn random samples for the line FWHM and\n  covering factor from the distributions shown in\n  \\autoref{figure:width_dist} and \\autoref{figure:covfact_dist}. In\n  both cases we find that the expected number of detections is not\n  sensitive to column densities below $N_{\\rm HI} = 2 \\times\n  10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$, indicating that such a survey will only be\n  sensitive to DLA systems.}\\label{figure:ndetections_nhi}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe cannot directly measure the spin temperatures of individual systems\nwithout additional data from either 21\\,cm emission or Lyman-$\\alpha$\nabsorption.  However, from \\autoref{figure:ndetections_total} it is\nevident that the total number of absorbing systems expected to be\ndetected with a reasonably large 21\\,cm survey is strongly dependent\non the assumed value for the spin temperature. Therefore, by comparing\nthe actual survey yield with that expected from the known\n\\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} distribution, we can infer the average spin\ntemperature of the atomic gas within the DLA population for a given\nredshift interval.\n\nAssuming that the total number of detections follows a Poisson\ndistribution, the probability of detecting $\\mathcal{N}$ intervening\nabsorbing systems is given by\n\\begin{equation} p(\\mathcal{N}|\\overline{\\mu}) =\n  {\\overline{\\mu}^{\\mathcal{N}} \\over \\mathcal{N}!}\n  \\mathrm{e}^{-\\overline{\\mu}},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\overline{\\mu}$ is the expected total number of detections\ngiven by the integral\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\overline{\\mu} = \\iiint{\\mu(T_{\\rm spin},\\Delta{v}_{50},c_{\\rm f})\\rho(T_{\\rm spin},\\Delta{v}_{50},c_{\\rm f})\\mathrm{d}T_{\\rm spin}\\mathrm{d}\\Delta{v}_{50}\\mathrm{d}c_{\\rm f}},\n\\end{equation}\nand $\\rho$ is the distribution of systems as a function of spin\ntemperature, line FWHM and covering factor. We assume that all three\nof these variables are independent\\footnote{In the case where thermal\n  broadening contributes significantly to the velocity dispersion, and\n  the spin temperature is dominated by collisional excitation, the\n  assumption that these are independent may no longer hold. However,\n  given that collisional excitation dominates in the CNM, where\n  $T_{\\rm spin} \\sim 100\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the velocity dispersion would\n  have to satisfy $\\Delta{v}_{50} \\ll 10$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ (c.f. the\n  distribution shown in \\autoref{figure:width_dist}).} so that $\\rho$\nfactorizes into functions of each. We then marginalise over the\ncovering factor and line width distributions shown in\n\\autoref{figure:width_dist} and \\autoref{figure:covfact_dist} so that\nthe expression for $\\overline{\\mu}$ reduces to\n\\begin{equation}\\label{equation:harmonic_spin_temp}\n  \\overline{\\mu} = \\int{\\mu(T_{\\rm spin})\\rho(T_{\\rm spin})\\mathrm{d}T_{\\rm spin}} = \\mu(\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}$ is the harmonic mean of the unknown\nspin temperature distribution, weighted by column density. This is\nanalogous to the spin temperature inferred from the detection of\nabsorption in a single intervening galaxy averaged over several\ngaseous components at different temperatures\n(e.g. \\citealt{Carilli:1996}).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.475\\textwidth]{ndetections_total.pdf}\n\\caption{The expected total number of detections in our simulated\n  ASKAP survey, as a function of a single spin temperature ($T_{\\rm\n    spin}$) and line FWHM ($\\Delta{v}_{50}$). The vertical dotted\n  lines enclose the velocity resolution across the observed frequency\n  band. We draw random samples for the covering factor from a uniform\n  distribution between 0 and 1 (as shown in\n  \\autoref{figure:covfact_dist}). The contours are truncated at $\\mu <\n  1$ for clarity.}\\label{figure:ndetections_total}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn the event of the survey yielding $\\mathcal{N}$ detections, we can\ncalculate the posterior probability density of $\\overline{T}_{\\rm\n  spin}$ using the following relationship between conditional\nprobabilities\n\\begin{equation}\n  p(\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}|\\mathcal{N}) = {p(\\mathcal{N}|\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin})p(\\overline{T}_{\\rm\n      spin})\\over p(\\mathcal{N})},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $p(\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin})$ is our prior probability density\nfor $\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}$ and $p(\\mathcal{N})$ is the marginal\nprobability of the number of detections, which can be treated as a\nnormalizing constant. The minimally informative Jeffreys prior for the\nmean value $\\mu$ of a Poisson distribution is $1/\\sqrt{\\mu}$\n(\\citealt{Jeffreys:1946})\\footnote{A suitable alternative choice for\n  the prior is the standard scale-invariant form $1/\\mu$\n  (e.g. \\citealt{Jeffreys:1961, Novick:1965, Villegas:1977}). While we\n  find that our choice of non-informative prior has negligible effect\n  on the spin temperature posterior for the full \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}}\n  absorption survey, as one would expect this choice becomes more\n  important for smaller surveys. For the early-science 1000\\,deg$^{2}$\n  survey discussed in \\autoref{section:tspin_results} we find that the\n  difference in these two priors produces a $\\sim 2$ to 20\\,per\\,cent\n  effect in the posterior. However, in all cases considered this\n  change is smaller than the 68.3\\,per\\,cent credible interval spanned\n  by the posterior.}. From \\autoref{equation:harmonic_spin_temp} it\ntherefore follows that a suitable form for the non-informative spin\ntemperature prior is $p(\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}) =\n1/\\sqrt{\\overline{\\mu}}$, so that\n\\begin{equation}\\label{equation:tspin_prob}\n  p(\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}|\\mathcal{N}) = C^{-1}\\,{\\overline{\\mu}^{(\\mathcal{N}-1/2)} \\over \\mathcal{N}!} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\overline{\\mu}}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere the distribution is normalised to unit total probability by\nevaluating the integral\n\\begin{equation}\n  C = \\int{{\\overline{\\mu}^{(\\mathcal{N}-1/2)} \\over \\mathcal{N}!} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\overline{\\mu}}}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe probabilistic relationship given by \\autoref{equation:tspin_prob}\nand the expected detection yield derived in\n\\autoref{section:all_sky_survey} can be used as a frame-work for\ninferring the harmonic-mean spin temperature using the results of any\nhomogeneous 21-cm survey. We have assumed that we can accurately\ndistinguish intervening absorbing systems from those associated with\nthe host galaxy of the radio source. However, any 21-cm survey will be\naccompanied by follow-up observations, at optical and sub-mm\nwavelengths, which will aid identification. Furthermore, future\nimplementation of probabilistic techniques to either use photometric\nredshift information or distinguish between line profiles should\nprovide further disambiguation.\n\nOf course we have not yet accounted for any error in our estimate of\n$\\overline{\\mu}$, which will increase our uncertainty in\n$\\overline{T}_\\mathrm{spin}$. In the following section we discuss\nthese possible sources of error and their effect on the result.\n\n\\section{Sources of error}\\label{section:errors}\n\nOur estimate of the expected number of 21\\,cm absorbers is dependent\nupon several distributions describing the properties of the foreground\nabsorbing gas and the background source distribution. For future\nlarge-scale 21\\,cm surveys, the accuracy to which we can infer the\nharmonic mean of the spin temperature distribution will eventually be\nlimited by the accuracy to which we can measure these other\ndistributions. In this section, we describe these errors and their\npropagation through to the estimate of $\\overline{T}_\\mathrm{spin}$,\nsummarizing our results in \\autoref{table:tspin_uncertainties}.\n\n\\subsection{The covering factor}\\label{section:covering_factor}\n\n\\subsubsection{Deviation from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1}\n\nThe fraction $c_{\\rm f}$ by which the foreground gas subtends the\nbackground radiation source is difficult to measure directly and is\nthereby a significant source of error for 21\\,cm absorption\nsurveys. In this work, we have assumed a uniform distribution for\n$c_{\\rm f}$, taking random values between 0 and 1. In\n\\autoref{section:expected_number}, we tested this assumption by\ncomparing it with the distribution of flux density core fractions in a\nsample of 37 quasars, used by \\cite{Kanekar:2014a} as a proxy for the\ncovering factor. By carrying out a two-tailed KS test, we found some\nevidence (at the 0.05 level) that this quasar sample was inconsistent\nwith our assumption of a uniform distribution between 0 and\n1. Noticeably there seems to be an under-representation of quasars in\nthe Kanekar et al. sample with estimated $c_{\\rm f} \\lesssim 0.2$. In\nthe low optical depth limit, the detection rate is dependent on the\nratio of spin temperature to covering factor, in which case a\nfractional deviation in $c_{\\rm f}$ will propagate as an equal\nfractional deviation in $\\overline{T}_\\mathrm{spin}$. Based on the\ndifference seen in the covering factor distribution of the Kanekar et\nal. sample and the uniform distribution, we assume that the spin\ntemperature can deviate by as much as $\\pm$10\\,per\\,cent.\n\n\\subsubsection{Evolution with redshift}\n\nWe also consider that the covering factor distribution may evolve with\nredshift, which would mimic a perceived evolution in the average spin\ntemperature. Such an effect was proposed by \\cite{Curran:2006b} and\n\\cite{Curran:2012b}, who claimed that the relative change in\nangular-scale behaviour of absorbers and radio sources between low-\nand high-redshift samples could explain the apparent evolution of the\nspin temperature found by \\cite{Kanekar:2003b}. To test for this\neffect in their larger DLA sample, \\cite{Kanekar:2014a} considered a\nsub-sample at redshifts greater than $z = 1$, for which the relative\nevolution of the absorber and source angular sizes should be\nminimal. While the significance of their result was reduced by\nremoving the lower redshift absorbers from their sample, they still\nfound a difference at $3.5\\,\\sigma$ significance between spin\ntemperature distributions in the two DLA sub-samples separated by a\nmedian redshift of $z = 2.683$.\n\nFuture surveys with ASKAP and the other SKA pathfinders will search\nfor \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} absorption at intermediate redshifts ($z \\sim\n1$), where the relative evolution of the absorber and source angular\nsizes is expected to be more significant than for the higher redshift\nDLA sample considered by \\cite{Kanekar:2014a}. We therefore consider\nthe potential effect of this cosmological evolution on the inferred\nvalue of $\\overline{T}_\\mathrm{spin}$. We approximate the covering\nfactor using the following model of \\cite{Curran:2006b}\n\\begin{equation}\\label{equation:covering_factor}\n  c_{f} \\approx\n\\begin{cases}\n  \\left({\\theta_{\\rm abs}\\over \\theta_{\\rm src}}\\right)^{2}, & \\text{if}\\ \\theta_{\\rm abs} < \\theta_{\\rm src}, \\\\\n  1, & \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\theta_{\\rm abs}$ and $\\theta_{\\rm src}$ are the angular sizes\nof the absorber and background source, respectively. Under the\nsmall-angle approximation $\\theta_{\\rm abs} \\approx {d_{\\rm\n    abs}/D_{\\rm abs}}$ and $\\theta_{\\rm abs} \\approx {d_{\\rm\n    src}/D_{\\rm src}}$, where $d_{\\rm abs}$ and $D_{\\rm abs}$ are the\nlinear size and angular diameter distance of the absorber, and\nlikewise $d_{\\rm src}$ and $D_{\\rm src}$ are the linear size and\nangular diameter distance of the background source. Assuming that the\nratio $d_{\\rm abs}/d_{\\rm src}$ is randomly distributed and\nindependent of redshift, any evolution in the covering factor is\ntherefore dominated by relative changes in the angular diameter\ndistances. We calculate the expected angular diameter distance ratio\nat a redshift $z$ by\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\left\\langle{D_{\\rm abs}\\over D_{\\rm src}}\\right\\rangle_{z} = D_{\\rm abs}(z){\\int_{z}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{N}_{\\rm src}(z^{\\prime})D_{\\rm src}(z^{\\prime})^{-1}\\mathrm{d}z^{\\prime}\\over\\int_{z}^{\\infty}\\mathcal{N}_{\\rm src} (z^{\\prime})\\mathrm{d}z^{\\prime}},\n\\end{equation}\nwhich, for the source redshift distribution model given by\n\\cite{deZotti:2010}, evolves from 0.7 at $z = 0.4$ to 1.0 at $z = 1.0$\n(see \\autoref{figure:dang_ratio}).  We note that this is consistent\nwith the behaviour measured by \\cite{Curran:2012b} for the total\nsample of DLAs observed at 21\\,cm wavelengths. By applying this as a\ncorrection to the otherwise uniformly distributed covering factor\n(using \\autoref{equation:covering_factor}), we find that the inferred\nvalue of $\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}$ systematically increases by\napproximately 30 per\\,cent.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.475\\textwidth]{dang_ratio.pdf}\n\\caption{The expected redshift behaviour of $D_{\\rm abs}/D_{\\rm src}$\n  based on the \\citet{deZotti:2010} model for the radio source redshift\n  distribution.}\\label{figure:dang_ratio}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{The $\\bmath{N_{\\rm HI}}$ frequency distribution}\n\n\\subsubsection{Uncertainty in the measurement of $f(N_{\\rm HI},X)$}\n\nWe assume that $f(N_{\\rm HI}, X)$ is relatively well understood as a\nfunction of redshift by interpolating between model gamma functions\nfitted to the distributions at $z = 0$ and $3$. However, these\ndistributions were measured from finite samples of galaxies, which of\ncourse have associated uncertainties that need to be considered. In\nthe case of the data presented by \\cite{Zwaan:2005} and\n\\cite{Noterdaeme:2009}, both have typical measurement uncertainties in\n$f(N_{\\rm HI}, X)$ of approximately 10\\,per\\,cent over the range of\ncolumn densities for which our simulated ASKAP survey is sensitive\n(see \\autoref{figure:ndetections_nhi}). This will propagate as a\n10\\,per\\,cent fractional error in the expected number of absorber\ndetections, and contribute a similar percentage uncertainty in the\ninferred average spin temperature.\n\n\\subsubsection{Correcting for 21\\,cm self-absorption}\n\nIn the local Universe, \\cite{Braun:2012} showed that self-absorption\nfrom opaque \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} clouds identified in high-resolution\nimages of the Local Group galaxies M31, M33 and the Large Magellanic\nCloud may necessitate a correction to the local atomic mass density of\nup to 30\\,per\\,cent. Although it is not yet clear whether this small\nsample of Local Group galaxies is representative of the low-redshift\npopulation, it is useful to understand how this effect might propagate\nthrough to our average spin temperature measurement. We therefore\nreplace the gamma-function parametrization of the local $f(N_{\\rm\n  HI})$ given by \\cite{Zwaan:2005} with the non-parametric values\ngiven in table\\,2 of \\cite{Braun:2012}, and recalculate\n$\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}$. For an all-sky survey with the full\n36-antenna ASKAP we find that $\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}$ increases by\n$\\sim$30 for 100 detections and $\\sim$10\\,per\\,cent for 1000\ndetections. Note that the correction increases for low numbers of\ndetections, which are dominated by the highest column density systems.\n\n\\subsubsection{Dust obscuration bias in optically-selected DLAs}\n\nAt higher redshifts, it is possible that the number density of\noptically-selected DLAs could be significantly underestimated as a\nresult of dust obscuration of the background quasar\n(\\citealt{Ostriker:1984}). This would cause a reduction in the\n$f(\\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}}, X)$ measured from optical surveys, thereby\nsignificantly underestimating the expected number of intervening\n21\\,cm absorbers at high redshifts. The issue is further compounded by\nthe expectation that the highest column density DLAs ($N_{\\rm HI}\n\\gtrsim 10^{21}$\\,cm$^{-2}$), for which future wide-field 21\\,cm\nsurveys are most sensitive (see \\autoref{figure:ndetections_nhi}), may\ncontain more dust than their less-dense counterparts.\n\nThis conclusion was supported by early analyses of the existing quasar\nsurveys at that time (e.g. \\citealt{Fall:1993}), which indicated that\nup to 70\\,per\\,cent of quasars could be missing from optical surveys\nthrough the effect of dust obscuration, albeit with large\nuncertainties. However, subsequent optical and infrared observations\nof radio-selected quasars (e.g. \\citealt{Ellison:2001};\n\\citealt*{Ellison:2005}; \\citealt{Jorgenson:2006}), which are free of\nthe potential selection biases associated with these optical surveys,\nfound that the severity of this issue was substantially over-estimated\nand that there was minimal evidence in support of a correlation\nbetween the presence of DLAs and dust reddening. Furthermore, the\n\\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} column density frequency distribution measured by\n\\cite{Jorgenson:2006} was found to be consistent with the\noptically-determined gamma-function parametrization of\n\\cite{Prochaska:2005}, with no evidence of DLA systems missing from\nthe SDSS sample at a sensitivity of $N_{\\rm HI} \\lesssim 5 \\times\n10^{21}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. Although radio-selected surveys of quasars are\nfree of the selection biases associated with optical surveys, they do\ntypically suffer from smaller sample sizes and are therefore less\nsensitive to the rarer DLAs with the highest column densities.\n\nAnother approach is to directly test whether optically-selected\nquasars with intervening DLAs, selected from the SDSS sample, are\nsystematically more dust reddened than a control sample of non-DLA\nquasars. Comparisons in the literature are based on several different\ncolour indicators, which include the spectral index\n(e.g. \\citealt{Murphy:2004,Murphy:2016}), spectral stacking\n(e.g. \\citealt{Frank:2010, Khare:2012}) and direct photometry\n(e.g. \\citealt*{Vladilo:2008}; \\citealt{Fukugita:2015}). The current\nstatus of these efforts is summarized by \\citet{Murphy:2016}, showing\nbroad support for a missing DLA population at the level of\n$\\sim$5\\,per\\,cent but highlighting that tension still exists between\ndifferent dust measurements. No substantial evidence has yet been\nfound to support a correlation between the dust reddening and\n\\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} column density in these optically selected DLA\nsurveys (e.g. \\citealt{Vladilo:2008, Khare:2012, Murphy:2016}).\n\nIn an attempt to reconcile the differences and myriad biases\nassociated with these techniques, \\cite{Pontzen:2009} carried out a\nstatistically-robust meta-analysis of the available optical and radio\ndata, using a Bayesian parameter estimation approach to model the dust\nas a function of column density and metallicity. They found that the\nexpected fraction of DLAs missing from optical surveys is\n7\\,per\\,cent, with fewer than 28\\,per\\,cent missing at 3\\,$\\sigma$\nconfidence. Based on this body of work we therefore assume that\napproximately 10\\,per\\,cent of DLAs are missing from the SDSS sample\nof \\cite{Noterdaeme:2009} and consider the affect on our estimate of\n$\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}$. We further assume that there is no\ndependance on column density, an assumption which is supported by the\naforementioned observational data for the range of column densities to\nwhich our 21\\,cm survey is sensitive. We find that increasing the\nhigh-redshift column density frequency distribution by 10\\,per\\,cent\nintroduces a systematic increase of approximately 3\\,per\\,cent in the\nexpected number of detections for the redshifts covered by our ASKAP\nsurveys. We note that this error will increase significantly for\n21\\,cm surveys at higher redshifts where the optically derived\n$f(\\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}}, X)$ dominates the calculation of the expected\ndetection rate.\n\n\\subsection{The radio source background}\n\nAs described in \\autoref{section:all_sky_survey}, we weight the\ncomoving path-length for each sight-line by a statistical redshift\ndistribution in order to account for evolution in the radio source\nbackground. We use the parametric model of \\cite{deZotti:2010}, which\nis derived from fitting the measured redshifts of \\cite{Brookes:2008}\nfor CENSORS sources brighter than 10\\,mJy, and assume that this\napplies to all sources in the range 10 - 1000\\,mJy. In\n\\autoref{figure:zdist}, we show the cumulative distribution of sources\nlocated behind a given redshift and the associated measurement\nuncertainty given by the errorbars. For the intermediate redshifts\ncovered by the ASKAP survey, the fractional uncertainty in this\ndistribution increases from $\\sigma_{\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm\n    src}}/\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm src} \\approx 3.5$ to 8\\,per\\,cent between\n$z = 0.4$ and 1.0, which propagates through to a similar fractional\nuncertainty in $\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}$. However, for higher\nredshifts this fractional uncertainty increases rapidly at $z > 2$, to\nmore than 50\\,per\\,cent at $z = 3$, reflecting the paucity of optical\nspectroscopic data for the high-redshift radio source\npopulation. Understanding how the radio source population is\ndistributed at lower flux densities and at higher redshifts is\ntherefore a concern for the future 21\\,cm absorption surveys\nundertaken with the SKA mid- and low-frequency telescopes (see\n\\citealt{Kanekar:2004} and \\citealt*{Morganti:2015} for reviews).\n\n\\begin{table} \n \\begin{threeparttable}\n   \\caption{An account of errors in our estimate of $\\overline{T}_{\\rm\n       spin}$ due to the accuracy to which we can determine the\n     expected number of absorber\n     detections.}\\label{table:tspin_uncertainties}\n  \\begin{tabular}{l@{\\hspace{0.05in}}l@{\\hspace{0.05in}}l@{\\hspace{0.05in}}l@{\\hspace{0.05in}}l} \n    \\hline\n    &  Source of error &  $\\mathrm{err}(\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin})$ & Refs. \\\\\n    & & [per\\,cent] & \\\\\n    \\hline\n    Covering factor & Distribution uncertainty & $\\pm10$ & $a$ \\\\\n    Covering factor & Systematic evolution & +30 & $a$, $b$\\\\ \n    $f(N_{\\rm HI}, X)$ & Measurement uncertainty & $\\pm10$ & $c, d$\\\\\n    Low-$z$ $f(N_{\\rm HI}, X)$ & Systematic self-absorption & $+(10-30)$ & $e$ \\\\ \n    High-$z$ $f(N_{\\rm HI}, X)$ & Systematic dust-obscuration & $+3$ & $f$, $g$ \\\\ \n    $\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm src}(z^{\\prime} \\geq z)$ & Measurement uncertainty & $\\pm 5$ & $h$, $i$ \\\\\n    \\hline\n   \\end{tabular}\n   \\begin{tablenotes}\n    \\item[] References: $^{a}${\\citet{Kanekar:2014a}},\n     $^{b}${\\citet{Curran:2012b}}, $^{c}${\\citet{Zwaan:2005}},\n     $^{d}${\\citet{Noterdaeme:2009}} , $^{e}${\\citet{Braun:2012}},\n     $^{f}${\\citet{Pontzen:2009}}, $^{g}${\\citet{Murphy:2016}},\n     $^{h}${\\citet{Brookes:2008}}, $^{i}${\\citet{deZotti:2010}}.\n   \\end{tablenotes}\n\\end{threeparttable}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{Expected results for future 21-cm absorption\n  surveys}\\label{section:tspin_results}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.475\\textwidth]{tspin_prob.pdf}\n\\caption{The posterior probability density of the average spin\n  temperature, as a function of absorber detection yield\n  ($\\mathcal{N}$).

We account for\nthe uncertainties in the expected detection rate $\\overline{\\mu}$,\ndiscussed in \\autoref{section:errors}, by using a Monte Carlo approach\nand marginalizing over many realizations. A yield of 1000 absorbers\nfrom such a survey would imply an average spin temperature of\n$\\overline{T}_\\mathrm{spin} =\n127^{+14}_{-14}\\,(193^{+23}_{-23})$\\,K\\footnote{We give the\n  68.3\\,per\\,cent interval about the median value measured from the\n  posterior distributions shown in \\autoref{figure:tspin_prob}.},\nwhere values in parentheses denote the alternative posterior\nprobability resulting from the systematic errors discussed in\n\\autoref{section:errors}. This scenario would indicate that a large\nfraction of the atomic gas in DLAs at these intermediate redshifts is\nin the classical stable CNM phase. Conversely, a yield of only 100\ndetections would imply that $\\overline{T}_\\mathrm{spin} =\n679^{+64}_{-65}\\,(1184^{+116}_{-120})$\\,K, indicating that less than\n10\\,per\\,cent of the atomic gas is in the CNM and that the bulk of the\nneutral gas in galaxies is significantly different at intermediate\nredshifts compared with the local Universe.\n\nWe also consider the effect of reducing the sky area and array size,\nwhich is relevant for planned early science surveys with ASKAP and\nother SKA pathfinder telescopes. In the bottom panel of\n\\autoref{figure:tspin_prob}, we show the spin temperatures inferred\nwhen observing a random 1000\\,deg$^{2}$ field for 12\\,h per pointing,\nbetween $z_{\\rm HI} = 0.4$ and $1.0$, using a 12-antenna version of\nASKAP. We find that detection yields of 30 and 3 from such a survey\nwould give inferred spin temperatures of $\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}\n=134^{+23}_{-27}\\,(209^{+40}_{-47})$ and\n$848^{+270}_{-430}\\,(1535^{+513}_{-837})$\\,K, respectively. The\nsignificant reduction in telescope sensitivity and sky-area,\ncompensated by the increase in integration time per pointing planned\nfor early-science, results in a factor of 30 decrease in the expected\nnumber of detections and therefore an increase in the sample variance\nand uncertainty in $\\overline{T}_{\\rm spin}$. However, this result\ndemonstrates that we expect to be able to distinguish between the\nlimiting cases of CNM-rich or deficient DLA populations even during\nthe early-science phases of the SKA pathfinders. For example 30\ndetections with the early ASKAP survey rules out an average spin\ntemperature of 1000\\,K at high probability.\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nWe have demonstrated a statistical method for measuring the average\nspin temperature of the neutral ISM in distant galaxies, using the\nexpected detection yields from future wide-field 21\\,cm absorption\nsurveys. The spin temperature is a crucial property of the ISM that\ncan be used to determine the fraction of the cold ($T_{\\rm k} \\sim\n100$\\,K) and dense ($n \\sim 100$\\,cm$^{-2}$) atomic gas that provides\nsites for the future formation of cold molecular gas clouds and star\nformation. Recent 21\\,cm surveys for \\mbox{H\\,{\\sc i}} absorption in\n\\mbox{Mg\\,{\\sc ii}} absorbers and DLAs towards distant quasars have\nyielded some evidence of an evolution in the average spin temperature\nthat might reveal a decrease in the fraction of cold dense atomic gas\nat high redshift (e.g. \\citealt{Gupta:2009, Kanekar:2014a}).\n\nBy combining recent specifications for ASKAP, with available\ninformation for the population of background radio sources, we show\nthat strong statistical constraints (approximately $\\pm10$\\,per\\,cent)\nin the average spin temperature can be achieved by carrying out a\nshallow 2-h per pointing survey of the southern sky between redshifts\nof $z = 0.4$ and $1.0$. However, we find that the accuracy to which we\ncan measure the average spin temperature is ultimately limited by the\naccuracy to which we can measure the distribution of the covering\nfactor, the $N_{\\rm HI}$ frequency distribution function and the\nevolution of the radio source population as a function of redshift. By\nimproving our understanding of these distributions we will be able to\nleverage the order-of-magnitude increases in sensitivity and redshift\ncoverage of the future SKA telescope, allowing us to measure the\nevolution of the average spin temperature to much higher redshifts.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements} \n\nWe thank Robert Allison, Elaine Sadler and Michael Pracy for useful\ndiscussions, and the anonymous referee for providing comments that\nhelped improve this paper.

{"text": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nGiven $\\rho>0$, we consider the problem\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:main_prob_U}\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\Delta U + \\lambda U = |U|^{p-1}U  & \\text{in }\\Omega,\\smallskip\\\\\n\\int_\\Omega U^2\\,dx = \\rho, \\quad U=0  & \\text{on }\\partial\\Omega,\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\Omega\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^N$ is a Lipschitz, bounded domain, $1<p<2^*-1$, $\\rho>0$ is a fixed\nparameter, and both $U\\in H^1_0(\\Omega)$ and $\\lambda\\in{\\mathbb{R}}$ are unknown. More precisely,\nwe investigate conditions on $p$ and $\\rho$ (and also $\\Omega$) for the solvability of\nthe problem.\n\nThe main interest in \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} relies on the investigation of standing wave\nsolutions for the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation\n\\[\ni\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial t}+\\Delta \\Phi+ |\\Phi|^{p-1}\\Phi=0,\\qquad\n(t,x)\\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\times \\Omega\n\\]\nwith Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\\partial\\Omega$. This equation appears in several\ndifferent physical models, both in the case $\\Omega={\\mathbb{R}}^N$ \\cite{MR2002047}, and on bounded\ndomains \\cite{MR1837207}. In particular, the latter case appears in nonlinear optics and in\nthe theory of Bose-Einstein condensation, also as a limiting case of the equation on ${\\mathbb{R}}^N$\nwith confining potential. When searching for solutions having the\nwave function $\\Phi$ factorized as $\\Phi(x,t)=e^{i\\lambda t} U(x)$, one obtains\nthat the real valued function $U$ must solve\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:NLS}\n-\\Delta U + \\lambda U = |U|^{p-1}U ,\\qquad U\\in H^1_0(\\Omega),\n\\end{equation}\nand two points of view are available. The first possibility is to assign the chemical\npotential $\\lambda\\in{\\mathbb{R}}$, and search for solutions of \\eqref{eq:NLS} as critical points of the\nrelated action functional. The literature concerning this approach is huge and we do not even\nmake an attempt to summarize it here. On the contrary, we focus on the second possibility,\nwhich consists in considering $\\lambda$ as part of the unknown and prescribing the mass  (or\ncharge) $\\|U\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2$ as a natural additional condition. Up to our knowledge,\nthe only previous paper dealing with this case, in bounded domains, is \\cite{MR3318740},\nwhich we describe below. The problem of searching for normalized solutions in ${\\mathbb{R}}^N$,\nwith non-homogeneous nonlinearities, is more investigated \\cite{MR3009665,MR1430506},\neven though the methods used there can not be easily extended to bounded domains, where\ndilations are not allowed. Very recently, also the case of partial confinement has been\nconsidered \\cite{BeBoJeVi_2016}.\n\nSolutions of \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} can be identified with critical points of the\nassociated energy functional\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E}(U) = \\frac12\\int_\\Omega|\\nabla U|^2\\,dx - \\frac{1}{p+1}  \\int_\\Omega|U|^{p+1}\\,dx\n\\]\nrestricted to the mass constraint\n\\[\n{\\mathcal{M}}_\\rho=\\{U\\in H_0^1(\\Omega) : \\|U\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}=\\rho\\},\n\\]\nwith $\\lambda$ playing the role of a Lagrange multiplier.\n\nA cricial role in the discussion of the above problem is played by the Gagliardo-Nirenberg\ninequality: for any $\\Omega$ and for any $v\\in H^1_0(\\Omega)$,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{sobest}\n\\|v\\|^{p+1}_{L^{p+1}(\\Omega)} \\leq C_{N,p} \\| \\nabla v \\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^{N(p-1)/2}\n\\| v \\|_{L^2(\\Omega)} ^{(p+1)-N(p-1)/2},\n\\end{equation}\nthe equality holding only when $\\Omega={\\mathbb{R}}^N$ and $v=Z_{N,p}$, the positive solution of $-\\Delta Z + Z = Z^{p}$ (which is unique up to\ntranslations \\cite{MR969899}).\nAccordingly, the exponent $p$ can be classified in relation with the so called\n\\emph{$L^2$-critical exponent} $1+4/N$ (throughout all the paper, $p$ will be always\nSobolev-subcritical and its criticality will be understood in the $L^2$ sense).\nIndeed we have that ${\\mathcal{E}}$ is bounded below and coercive on ${\\mathcal{M}}_\\rho$ if and only if\neither $p$ is subcritical, or it is critical and $\\rho$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThe recent paper \\cite{MR3318740} deals with problem \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} in the case of the spherical domain $\\Omega = B_1$, when searching for positive solutions $U$.\nIn particular, it is shown that the solvability of \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} is strongly influenced by the exponent $p$, indeed:\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item in the subcritical case $1<p<1+4/N$, \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} admits a unique positive\n solution for every $\\rho>0$;\n \\item if $p=1+4/N$ then \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} admits a unique\n positive solution for\n \\[\n 0<\\rho<\\rho^*=\\left(\\frac{p+1}{2C_{N,p}}\\right)^{N/2}=\\|Z_{N,p}\\|^2_{L^2({\\mathbb{R}}^N)},\n \\]\n and no positive solutions for $\\rho\\geq\\rho^*$;\n \\item finally, in the supercritical regime $1+4/N<p<2^*-1$, \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} admits positive\n solutions if and only if $0<\\rho\\leq\\rho^*$ (the threshold $\\rho^*$ depending on $p$), and such\n solutions are at least two for $\\rho<\\rho^*$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn this paper we carry on such analysis, dealing with a general domain $\\Omega$ and with solutions which\nare not necessarily positive.\nMore precisely, let us recall that for any $U$ solving \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} for some $\\lambda$, it is well-defined the Morse index\n\\[\nm(U) = \\max\\left\\{k : \\begin{array}{l}\n\\exists V\\subset H^1_0(\\Omega),\\,\\dim(V)= k:\\forall v\\in V\\setminus\\{0\\}\\smallskip\\\\\n\\displaystyle\\int_\\Omega |\\nabla v|^2 + \\lambda v^2 - p|U|^{p-1}v^2\\,dx<0\n\\end{array}\n\\right\\}\\in{\\mathbb{N}}.\n\\]\nThen, if $\\Omega=B_1$, it is well known that a solution $U$ of \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} is\npositive if and only if $m(U)=1$. Under this perspective, the results in \\cite{MR3318740}\ncan be read in terms of Morse index one--solutions, rather than positive ones: introducing the sets of admissible masses\n\\[\n{\\mathfrak{A}}_k ={\\mathfrak{A}}_k(p,\\Omega) := \\left\\{\\rho>0 : \\begin{array}{l} \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U}\n\\text{ admits a solution $U$ (for some $\\lambda$)}\\\\ \\text{having Morse index }m(U)\\leq k\n\\end{array} \\right\\},\n\\]\nthen \\cite{MR3318740} implies that ${\\mathfrak{A}}_1(p,B_1)$ is a bounded interval if\nand only if $p$ is critical or supercritical, while ${\\mathfrak{A}}_1(p,B_1)={\\mathbb{R}}^+$ in the subcritical case.\nOn the contrary, when considering general domains and higher Morse index, the situation may become\nmuch more complicated. We collect some examples in the following remark.\n\\begin{remark}\\label{rem:specialdomains}\nIn the case of a symmetric domain, one can use any solution as a building block to construct other solutions with\na more complex behavior, obtaining the so-called necklace solitary waves. Such kind of solutions are constructed\nin \\cite{MR3426917}, even though in such paper the focus is on stability, rather than on normalization conditions.\nFor instance, by scaling argument, any Dirichlet solution of $-\\Delta U + \\lambda U = |U|^{p-1}U$ in a rectangle $R=\\prod_{i=1}^N(a_i,b_i)$ can\nbe scaled to a solution of $-\\Delta U + k^2\\lambda U = |U|^{p-1}U$ in $R/k$, $k\\in{\\mathbb{N}}_+$, and then $k^N$ copies of it can be\njuxtaposed, with alternating sign. In this way one obtains a new solution on $R$ having $k^{4/(p-1)}$ times the mass of the starting one,\nand eventually solutions in $R$ with arbitrarily high mass (but with higher Morse index) can be constructed even in the critical\nand supercritical case. An analogous construction can be performed in the disk, using solutions in circular sectors as building blocks,\neven though in this case explicit bounds on the mass obtained are more delicate.\nAlso, instead of symmetric domains, singular perturbed ones can be considered, such as dumbbell domains\n\\cite{MR949628}: for instance, using \\cite[Theorem 3.5]{MR2997381}, one can show that for any $k$, there exists a domain $\\Omega$,\nwhich is close in a suitable sense to the disjoint union of $k$ domains, such that \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} has a \\emph{positive}\nsolution on $\\Omega$ with Morse index $k$ and $\\rho=\\rho_k\\to+\\infty$ as $k\\to+\\infty$.\nThis kind of results justifies the choice of classifying the solutions in terms of their Morse index, rather\nthan in terms of their nodal properties.\n\\end{remark}\n\nMotivated by the previous remark, the first question we address in this paper concerns the boundedness of ${\\mathfrak{A}}_k$.\nWe provide the following complete classification.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:bbd_index}\nFor every $\\Omega\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^N$ bounded $C^1$ domain, $k\\ge1$, $1<p<2^*-1$,\n\\[\n\\sup{\\mathfrak{A}}_k(p,\\Omega) < +\\infty\n\\qquad\\iff\\qquad\np \\ge 1+\\frac{4}{N}.\n\\]\n\\end{theorem}\nThe proof of such result, which is outlined in Section \\ref{sec:blow-up}, is obtained\nby a detailed blow-up analysis of sequences of solutions with bounded Morse index, via\nsuitable a priori pointwise estimates (see \\cite{MR2063399}). In this respect, the\nregularity assumption on $\\partial\\Omega$ simplifies the treatment of possible\nconcentration phenomena towards the boundary. The argument, which holds\nfor solutions which possibly change sign, is inspired by \\cite{MR2825606}, where the\ncase of positive solutions is treated.\n\nOnce Theorem \\ref{thm:bbd_index} is established, in case $p\\geq 1 + 4/N$ two questions arise, namely:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n \\item is it possible to provide lower bounds for $\\sup{\\mathfrak{A}}_k$? Is it true that $\\sup{\\mathfrak{A}}_k$ is strictly increasing in $k$, or, at least, that $\\sup{\\mathfrak{A}}_k > \\sup{\\mathfrak{A}}_1$ for some $k$?\n \\item is \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} solvable for every $\\rho\\in(0,\\sup{\\mathfrak{A}}_k)$, or at least can we characterize some subinterval of solvability?\n\\end{enumerate}\nIt is clear that both issues can be addressed by characterizing\nvalues of $\\rho$ for which existence (and multiplicity) of solutions with\nbounded Morse index can be guaranteed. To this aim, it can be useful to restate\nproblem \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} as\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:main_prob_u}\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\Delta u + \\lambda u = \\mu|u|^{p-1}u  & \\text{in }\\Omega,\\\\\n\\int_\\Omega u^2\\,dx = 1, \\quad u=0  & \\text{on }\\partial\\Omega,\n\\end{cases}\n\\qquad\\text{where}\\quad\n\\begin{cases}\nU=\\sqrt{\\rho} u\\\\\n\\mu = \\rho^{(p-1)/2},\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere now $\\mu>0$ is prescribed. Since\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{Emu}\n\\text{both } \\mathcal{E}_{\\mu}(u) := \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\Omega}|\\nabla u|^2- \\frac{\\mu}{p+1}\\int_{\\Omega}| u|^{p+1}\n\\qquad\n\\text{and }{\\mathcal{M}}={\\mathcal{M}}_1=\\{u : \\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}=1\\}\n\\end{equation}\nare invariant under the ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$-action of the involution $u\\mapsto -u$, solutions of\n\\eqref{eq:main_prob_u} can be found via min-max principles in the framework of index\ntheories (see e.g. \\cite[Ch. II.5]{St_2008}). Notice that in the supercritical case\n${\\mathcal{E}}_\\mu$ is not bounded from below on ${\\mathcal{M}}$.  Following \\cite{MR3318740}, it can be\nconvenient to parameterize solutions to \\eqref{eq:main_prob_u} with respect to the\n$H^1_0$-norm, therefore we introduce the sets\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:defBU}\n\\mathcal{B}_\\alpha:=\\left\\{u\\in {\\mathcal{M}}:\\,\\int_\\Omega |\\nabla u|^2\\,dx<\\alpha\\right\\},\\quad\\quad\n\\mathcal{U}_\\alpha:=\\left\\{u\\in {\\mathcal{M}}:\\,\\int_\\Omega |\\nabla u|^2\\,dx=\\alpha\\right\\}.\n\\end{equation}\nIntroducing the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $-\\Delta$ in $H^1_0(\\Omega)$,\n$\\lambda_1(\\Omega)$, we have that the sets above are non-empty whenever $\\alpha>\n\\lambda_1(\\Omega)$.\nSince we are interested in critical points\nhaving Morse index bounded from above, following \\cite{MR968487,MR954951,MR991264} we\nintroduce the following notion of genus.\n\\begin{definition}\\label{def:genus}\nLet $A\\subset H^1_0(\\Omega)$ be a closed set, symmetric with respect to the origin (i.e.\n$-A=A$). We define the \\emph{genus} $\\gamma$ of a $A$ as\n\\[\n\\gamma(A) := \\sup\\{m : \\exists h \\in C({\\mathbb{S}}^{m-1};A),\\, h(-u)=-h(u)\\}.\n\\]\nFurthermore, we define\n\\[\n\\Sigma_{\\alpha}=\\{A\\subset \\overline{\\mathcal{B}}_\\alpha: A\\text{ is closed and }-A=A\\},\n\\qquad\n\\Sigma^{(k)}_{\\alpha}=\\{A\\in \\Sigma_{\\alpha} : \\gamma(A)\\ge k\\},\n\\]\n\\end{definition}\nWe remark that this notion of genus is different from the\nclassical one of \\emph{Krasnoselskii genus}, which is well suited for estimates\nof the Morse index from below, rather than above. Nonetheless, $\\gamma$ shares with\nthe Krasnoselskii genus most of the main properties of an index\n\\cite{MR0163310,MR0065910}. In particular, by the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem, any set $A$\nhomeomorphic to the sphere ${\\mathbb{S}}^{m-1} := \\partial B_1 \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^m$ has genus\n$\\gamma(A) = m$. Furthermore, we show in Section \\ref{sec:2const} that $\\Sigma^{(k)}_{\\alpha}$ is not empty,\nprovided $\\alpha>\\lambda_k(\\Omega)$ (the $k$-th Dirichlet eigenvalue of $-\\Delta$ in $H^1_0(\\Omega)$).\n\nEquipped with this notion of genus we provide two different variational principles\nfor solutions of \\eqref{eq:main_prob_u} (and thus of \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U}). The first\none is based on a variational problem with \\emph{two constraints}, which was exploited as the\nmain tool in proving the results in \\cite{MR3318740}.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:genus_2constr}\nLet $k\\geq1$ and $\\alpha>\\lambda_{k}(\\Omega)$.

Then\n\\[\n(0,\\hat\\rho_k) \\subset {\\mathfrak{A}}_k.\n\\]\n\\end{corollary}\nThe link between Theorem \\ref{thm:genus_2constr} and Theorem \\ref{thm:genus_1constr} is that we can provide explicit estimates\nof $\\hat \\mu_k$ (and hence of $\\hat\\rho_k$) in terms of the map $\\alpha\\mapsto M_{\\alpha,k}$ (see Section \\ref{sec:1const}).\n\nWe stress that the above\nresults hold for any Lipschitz $\\Omega$. As a first consequence, this allows to extend the\nexistence result in \\cite{MR3318740} to non-radial domains.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:intro_GS}\nFor every $0<\\rho<\\hat\\rho_1=\\hat\\rho_1(\\Omega,p)$ problem \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} admits a solution which is a local minimum of\nthe energy ${\\mathcal{E}}$ on ${\\mathcal{M}}_\\rho$. In particular, $U$ is positive, has Morse index one and the associated solitary wave is orbitally\nstable.\n\nFurthermore, for every Lipschitz $\\Omega$,\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $\\displaystyle 1<p<1+\\frac{4}{N} \\implies \\hat\\rho_1\\left(\\Omega,p\\right)\n= +\\infty$,\n\\item $\\displaystyle p=1+\\frac{4}{N} \\implies \\hat\\rho_1\\left(\\Omega,p\\right)\n\\geq  \\|Z_{N,p}\\|^2_{L^2({\\mathbb{R}}^N)}$,\n\\item $\\displaystyle 1+\\frac{4}{N}<p<2^*-1 \\implies \\hat\\rho_1\\left(\\Omega,p\\right)\n\\geq D_{N,p} \\lambda_1(\\Omega)^{\\frac{2}{p-1}-\\frac{N}{2}}$,\n\\end{itemize}\nwhere the universal constant $D_{N,p}$ is explicitly written in terms of $N$ and $p$ in\nSection \\ref{sec:1const}.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\begin{remark}\\label{rem:introGS}\nOf course, in the subcritical and critical cases, $c_1$ is actually a global minimum.\nFurthermore, the lower bound for the supercritical case agrees with that of the critical one\nsince, as shown in Section  \\ref{sec:1const}, $D_{N,1+4/N} = \\|Z_{N,p}\\|^2_{L^2({\\mathbb{R}}^N)}$\n(and $\\lambda_1(\\Omega)$ is raised to the $0^{\\text{th}}$-power). Notice that the estimate for the supercritical case is new also in the case $\\Omega=B_1$.\n\\end{remark}\nWe observe that the exponent of $\\lambda_1(\\Omega)$ in the supercritical threshold is negative,\ntherefore such threshold decreases with the size of $\\Omega$.\n\nOnce the first thresholds have been estimated, we turn to the higher ones: by exploiting\nthe relations between $M_{\\alpha,k}$ and $c_k$, we can show that the thresholds obtained\nfor Morse index one--solutions in Theorem \\ref{thm:intro_GS} can be increased, by\nconsidering higher Morse index--solutions, at least for some exponent.\n\\begin{proposition}\\label{thm:intro_3>1}\nFor every $\\Omega$ and $1<p<2^*-1$,\n\\[\n\\hat\\rho_3\\left(\\Omega,p\\right) \\geq 2 \\cdot D_{N,p} \\lambda_3(\\Omega)^{\\frac{2}{p-1}-\\frac{N}{2}}.\n\\]\n\\end{proposition}\n\\begin{remark}\nIn the critical case, the lower bound for $\\hat\\rho_3$ provided by Proposition \\ref{thm:intro_3>1} is twice that for $\\hat\\rho_1$ obtained in Theorem \\ref{thm:intro_GS}.\nBy continuity, the estimate for $\\hat\\rho_3$ is larger than that for $\\hat\\rho_1$ also when\n$p$ is supercritical, but not too large. To quantify such assertion, we can use Yang's inequality\n\\cite{MR1894540,MR2262780}, which implies that for every $\\Omega$ it holds\n\\[\n\\lambda_3(\\Omega)\\leq \\left(1+\\frac{N}{4}\\right)2^{2/N} \\lambda_1(\\Omega).\n\\]\nWe deduce that $2 \\cdot D_{N,p} \\lambda_3(\\Omega)^{\\frac{2}{p-1}-\\frac{N}{2}}\n\\geq  D_{N,p} \\lambda_1(\\Omega)^{\\frac{2}{p-1}-\\frac{N}{2}}$ whenever\n\\[\np\\leq 1+\\frac{4}{N} + \\frac{8}{N^2\\log_2\\left(1+\\frac{4}{N}\\right)}.\n\\]\nIn particular, the physically relevant case $N=3$, $p=3$ is covered. Furthermore, if\n$N\\geq 7$, the above condition holds for every $p<2^*-1$.\n\\end{remark}\nBeyond existence results for\n\\eqref{eq:main_prob_U}, also multiplicity results can be achieved. A first general\nconsideration, with this respect, is that Theorem \\ref{thm:genus_1constr} holds true\nalso when using the standard Krasnoselskii genus instead of $\\gamma$; this allows to\nobtain critical points having Morse index bounded from below (see\n\\cite{MR968487,MR954951,MR991264}), and therefore to obtain infinitely many solutions,\nat least when $\\rho$ is less than some threshold. More specifically, we can also\nprove the existence of a second solution in the supercritical case, thus extending to\nany $\\Omega$ the multiplicity result obtained in \\cite{MR3318740} for the ball.\nIndeed, on the one\nhand, in the supercritical case ${\\mathcal{E}}_\\mu$ is unbounded from below; on the other hand\nthe solution obtained in Theorem \\ref{thm:genus_1constr}, for $k=1$, is a local minimum.\nThus the Mountain Pass Theorem \\cite{MR0370183} applies on $\\mathcal{M}$, and a second solution can be\nfound for $\\mu<\\hat\\mu_1$, see Proposition \\ref{mpcritlev} for further details (and also\nRemark \\ref{rem:further_crit_lev} for an analogous construction for $k\\ge2$).\n\n\n\nTo conclude this introduction, let us mention that the explicit lower bounds obtained in\nTheorem \\ref{thm:intro_GS} can be easily applied in order to gain\nmuch more information also in the case of special domains, as those considered in\nRemark \\ref{rem:specialdomains}. For instance, we can prove then following.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{pro:symm}\nLet $\\Omega=B$ be a ball in ${\\mathbb{R}}^N$. Then\n\\[\np<1+\\frac{4}{N-1}\n\\quad\\implies\\quad\n\\text{\\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} admits a solution for every }\\rho>0.\n\\]\nAn analogous result holds when $\\Omega=R$ is a rectangle, without further restrictions on\n$p<2^*-1$.\n\\end{theorem}\nTherefore our starting problem in $\\Omega=B$ can be solved for any mass value also in the critical and\nsupercritical regime, at least for $p$ smaller than this further critical exponent $1+4/(N-1) > 1+ 4/N$.\nOf course, higher masses require higher Morse index--solutions. In particular, since by \\cite{MR3318740}\nwe know that ${\\mathfrak{A}}_1(B,1+4/N) = (0,\\|Z_{N,p}\\|_{L^2})$, we have that for\nlarger masses, even though no positive solution exists, nodal solutions with higher\nMorse index can be obtained: in such cases \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} admits \\emph{nodal ground\nstates with higher Morse index}.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: in Section \\ref{sec:blow-up} we perform a blow-up analysis of\nsolutions with bounded Morse index, in order to prove Theorem \\ref{thm:bbd_index}; Section \\ref{sec:2const}\nis devoted to the analysis of the variational problem with two constraints \\eqref{maxmin}\nand to the proof of Theorem \\ref{thm:genus_2constr};\nthat of Theorems \\ref{thm:genus_1constr}, \\ref{thm:intro_GS} and Proposition\n\\ref{thm:intro_3>1} is developed\nin Section \\ref{sec:1const}, by means of the variational problem with one constraint\n\\eqref{infsuplev}; finally, Section\n\\ref{sec:symm} contains the proof of Theorem \\ref{pro:symm}.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Notation.} We use the standard notation\n$\\{\\varphi_k\\}_{k\\geq1}$ for a basis of eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet laplacian in $\\Omega$,\northogonal in $H^1_0(\\Omega)$ and orthonormal in $L^2(\\Omega)$. Such functions are ordered in such\na way that the corresponding eigenvalues $\\lambda_k(\\Omega)$ satisfy\n\\[\n0<\\lambda_1(\\Omega)<\\lambda_2(\\Omega)\\leq\\lambda_3(\\Omega)\\leq\\dots,\n\\]\nand $\\varphi_1$ is chosen to be positive on $\\Omega$. $C_{N,p}$ denotes the universal constant in\nthe Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality \\eqref{sobest}, which is achieved (uniquely, up to translations and dilations)\nby the positive, radially symmetric function $Z_{N,p}\\in H^1({\\mathbb{R}}^N)$, with\n\\[\n\\|Z_{N,p}\\|^2_{L^2({\\mathbb{R}}^N)}=\\left(\\frac{p+1}{2C_{N,p}}\\right)^{N/2}.\n\\]\nFinally, $C$ denotes every (positive) constant we need not to specify, whose value may change also within the same formula.\n\n\\section{Blow-up analysis of solutions with bounded Morse index}\\label{sec:blow-up}\n\nThroughout this section we will deal with a sequence $\\{(u_n,\\mu_n,\\lambda_n)\\}_n \\subset H^1_0(\\Omega)\\times{\\mathbb{R}}^+\\times{\\mathbb{R}}$ satisfying\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:auxiliary_n}\n-\\Delta u_n+\\lambda_n u_n=\\mu_n |u_n|^{p-1}u_n,\\qquad\\int_\\Omega u_n^2\\, dx=1,\\qquad \\int_\\Omega |\\nabla u_n|^2\\, dx=:\\alpha_n.\n\\end{equation}\nTo start with, we recall the following result (actually, in \\cite{MR3318740}, the result is stated for positive solution, but the proof\ndoes not require such assumption).\n\\begin{lemma}[{\\cite[Lemma 2.5]{MR3318740}}]\\label{lemma:case_alpha_n_bounded}\nTake a sequence $\\{(u_n,\\mu_n,\\lambda_n)\\}_n$ as in \\eqref{eq:auxiliary_n}.

In particular, $\\tilde V$ is stable outside a compact set (see Definition $2.1$ in \\cite{MR2825606}) so that, by Theorem $2.3$ and Remark $2.4$  of \\cite{MR2825606}, we have\n$$\\tilde V(x)\\rightarrow 0 \\quad\\quad \\text{as} \\quad\\quad |x|\\rightarrow +\\infty.$$\nMoreover, since $\\tilde V$ is not trivial, we also have that $\\tilde\\lambda>0$.

To start with, it satisfies\nthe Palais-Smale (P.S. for short) condition on $\\overline{\\mathcal{B}}_{\\alpha}$; more precisely, the following\nholds.\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{psball}\nEvery P.S. sequence $u_n$ for $f\\big |_{\\overline{\\mathcal{B}}_{\\alpha}}$ is a P.S.\nsequence  for $f\\big |_{\\mathcal{U}_{\\alpha}}$ and has a strongly convergent\nsubsequence in $\\mathcal{U}_{\\alpha}$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}\nWe first show that there are no P.S. sequences in ${\\mathcal{B}_{\\alpha}}$. In fact, if $u_n$ is such a sequence, there is a sequence of real numbers $k_n$ such that\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{ps}\n\\int_{\\Omega}|u_n|^{p-1}u_n\\,v-k_n\\int_{\\Omega}u_n\\,v=o(1)\\,\\|v\\|_{H^1_0}\n\\end{equation}\nfor every $v\\in H^1_0(\\Omega)$. Since $u_n$ is bounded in $H^1_0(\\Omega)$, there is a subsequence (still denoted by $u_n$)\nweakly convergent to $u\\in H^1_0(\\Omega)$; moreover, $u_n$ converges strongly in $L^{p+1}(\\Omega)$ and in $L^2(\\Omega)$ to the same limit. By choosing $v=u_n$, we see that $k_n$ is bounded, so that we can also assume that $k_n\\rightarrow k$. By taking the limit of \\eqref{ps} for $n\\to\\infty$ we get\n\\begin{equation}\n\\nonumber\n\\int_{\\Omega}|u|^{p-1}u\\,v=k\\int_{\\Omega}u\\,v\n\\end{equation}\nfor every $v\\in H^1_0(\\Omega)$. Hence $u$ is constant, but this contradicts $u\\in {\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\nNow, if $u_n$ is a P.S. sequence for $f$ on ${\\mathcal{U}}_{\\alpha}$, there are sequences of real numbers $k_n$, $l_n$ such that\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{ps1}\n\\int_{\\Omega}|u_n|^{p-1}u_n\\,v-k_n\\int_{\\Omega}u_n\\,v-l_n\\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla u_n\\,\\nabla v=o(1)\\,\\|v\\|_{H^1_0}.\n\\end{equation}\nIt is readily seen that $l_n$ is bounded away from zero, otherwise \\eqref{ps1} is equivalent to \\eqref{ps} (for some subsequence) and we still reach a contradiction. Then, we can divide both sides by $l_n$ and find that\nthere are sequences $\\{\\lambda_n\\}_n$, $\\{\\mu_n\\}_n$, with $\\mu_n$ bounded, such that\n\\begin{equation}\n\\nonumber\n\\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla u_n\\,\\nabla v+\\lambda_n\\int_{\\Omega}u_n\\,v-\\mu_n\\int_{\\Omega}|u_n|^{p-1}u_n\\,v=o(1)\\,\\|v\\|_{H^1_0}.\n\\end{equation}\nNow, by reasoning as before one finds that\nalso the sequence $\\{\\lambda_n\\}_n$ is bounded, so that by the relation\n$$-\\Delta u_n+\\lambda_n u_n-\\mu_n |u_n|^{p-1}u_n=o(1)\\quad \\mathrm{in}\\,\\, H^{-1}(\\Omega)$$\nand  by the compactness of the embedding $H^1_0(\\Omega)\\hookrightarrow L^{p+1}(\\Omega)$, the P.S. condition holds for the functional $f\\big |_{{\\mathcal{U}}_{\\alpha}}$.\n\\end{proof}\nWe can combine the previous lemmas to prove one of the main results stated in the introduction.\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \\ref{thm:genus_2constr}]\nLemma \\ref{psball} allows to apply standard variational methods (see e.g.\n\\cite[Thm. II.5.7]{St_2008}). We deduce that\n$M_{\\alpha,\\,k}$ is achieved\nat some critical point $u$ of $f\\big |_{\\mathcal{U}_{\\alpha}}$.\nThis amounts to say that $u$ satisfies \\eqref{lagreq}\nfor some real $\\lambda$ and $\\mu\\neq 0$. We claim that there exists at least one\n$u\\in f^{-1}(M_{\\alpha,\\,k})\\cap \\mathcal{U}_{\\alpha}$ such that \\eqref{lagreq} holds with $\\mu>0$.\nAssume by contradiction that for \\emph{every} critical point of $f\\big |_{\\mathcal{U}_{\\alpha}}$ at level $M_{\\alpha,k}$ it holds $\\mu< 0$ in equation \\eqref{lagreq}.\n\nLet us define the functional $T:\\,H^1_0(\\Omega)\\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ as\n$$T(u)=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\Omega}|\\nabla u|^2.$$\nBy denoting with $D$ the Fr\\'{e}chet derivative and by $<\\,,\\,>$ the pairing between $H_0^1$ and its dual $H^{-1}$, our assumption can be restated as follows:\n\n\\noindent if there are $u\\in f^{-1}(M_{\\alpha,\\,k})\\cap\\mathcal{U}_{\\alpha}$ and $\\mu\\neq 0$  such that\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{lagreq1}\n\\langle DT(u),\\phi\\rangle=\\mu\\langle Df(u),\\phi\\rangle\n\\end{equation}\nfor every $\\phi\\in H^1_0(\\Omega)$ satisfying $\\int_{\\Omega}\\phi u=0$ (that is for every $\\phi$ tangent\nto ${\\mathcal{M}}$ at $u$) then $\\mu<0$.\n\nWe stress that both $DT(u)$ and $Df(u)$ in the above equation are bounded away from zero, since there are no Dirichlet eigenfunctions in $\\mathcal{U}_{\\alpha}$ nor critical points of $f$ on ${\\mathcal{M}}$.\nHence, by denoting with $\\nabla_{T{\\mathcal{M}}}$ the gradient of a functional (in $H^1_0$) in the direction tangent to ${\\mathcal{M}}$, if $u\\in f^{-1}(M_{\\alpha,\\,k})\\cap \\mathcal{U}_{\\alpha}$ then $\\nabla_{T{\\mathcal{M}}}T(u)$ and\n$\\nabla_{T{\\mathcal{M}}}f(u)$ \\emph{are either  opposite or not parallel}. Moreover, the angle between these (non vanishing) vectors is \\emph{bounded away from zero}; otherwise, we would find sequences $u_n\\in \\mathcal{U}_{\\alpha}$, $\\mu_n>0$ such that\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{noparal}\n(\\nabla_{T{\\mathcal{M}}}T(u_n),v)_{H^1_0}-\\mu_n(\\nabla_{T{\\mathcal{M}}}f(u_n),v)_{H^1_0}=o(1)\\|v\\|_{H^1_0}\n\\end{equation}\nfor every $v\\in H^1_0(\\Omega)$; but since\n$$(\\nabla_{T{\\mathcal{M}}}T(u_n),v)_{H^1_0}=\\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla u_n\\,\\nabla v-\\lambda_n^T\\int_{\\Omega}u_n\\, v\\,,$$\n$$(\\nabla_{T{\\mathcal{M}}}f(u_n),v)_{H^1_0}=\\int_{\\Omega}|u_n|^{p-1}u_n\\,v-\\lambda_n^f\\int_{\\Omega}u_n\\, v\\,,$$\nfor suitable bounded sequences $\\lambda_n^T$, $\\lambda_n^f$, this is equivalent to saying that $u_n$ is a P.S. sequence for\n$f\\big |_{\\mathcal{U}_{\\alpha}}$, so that, by Lemma \\ref{psball}, we would get a constrained critical point with $\\mu>0$.\n\nThen, by choosing suitable linear combinations of the above tangential components\none can define a bounded $\\mathcal{C}^1$ map $u\\mapsto v(u)\\in H_0^1(\\Omega)$, with $v(u)$ tangent to ${\\mathcal{M}}$\nand satisfying the following property: there is $\\delta>0$ such that\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{diseqv}\n\\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla u\\,\\nabla v(u)< -\\delta\\, ,\\quad\\quad \\int_{\\Omega}|u|^{p-1}u\\,v(u)>\\delta\\,,\n\\end{equation}\nfor every $u\\in f^{-1}(M_{\\alpha,\\,k})\\cap \\mathcal{U}_{\\alpha}$.

In this section we are concerned with critical\npoints of $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mu}$ on ${\\mathcal{M}}$ (which, in turn, correspond to solutions of our\nstarting problem \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U}).\n\nBy the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality \\eqref{sobest},\nsetting $\\|\\nabla u\\|^2_{L^2}=\\alpha$, one obtains\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:boundonboundEmu}\n\\frac12\\,\\alpha- \\mu\\frac{C_{N,p}}{p+1}\\,\\alpha^{N(p-1)/4}\n\\leq \\mathcal{E}_{\\mu}(u)\\le \\frac12\\alpha.\n\\end{equation}\nIn particular, $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mu}$ is bounded on any bounded subset of ${\\mathcal{M}}$,\nand it is bounded from below (and coercive) on the entire ${\\mathcal{M}}$ for {subcritical} $p<1+4/N$\nand for {critical} $p=1+4/N$ whenever $\\mu< \\frac{p+1}{2}C_{N,p}^{-1}$ .\nIn these cases, one can easily show that $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mu}$ satifies the P.S. condition\nand apply the classical {minimax principle for even functionals} on a closed symmetric\nsubmanifold (see e.g. \\cite[Thm. II.5.7]{St_2008}).\n\nIn the complementary case, when $p$ is either supercritical, i.e. $p>1+4/N$, or\ncritical and $\\mu$ is large, then $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mu}$ is not bounded from below (see e.g.\n\\eqref{minusinfty} below). In order to provide a minimax principle suitable for this case,\nwe recall the Definition \\ref{def:genus} of genus and\nthat of $\\mathcal{B}_\\alpha$ (see equation \\eqref{eq:defBU}). Furthermore, we denote with $K_{c}$ the (closed and symmetric) set of critical points of\n${\\mathcal{E}}_\\mu$ at level $c$ contained in $\\mathcal{B}_\\alpha$. The following theorem is an adaptation of well known arguments\nof previous critical point theorems relying on index theory.\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{infsupteo}\nLet $k\\ge1$, $\\alpha>\\lambda_k(\\Omega)$, $\\mu>0$ and $\\tau>0$ be fixed, and let $c_k$ be defined as\nin Theorem \\ref{thm:genus_1constr}, equation \\eqref{infsuplev}.

By a suitably modified version of\nthe Deformation Lemma (recall that ${\\mathcal{E}}_\\mu$ satisfies the P.S. condition on ${\\mathcal{M}}$),\nthere exist $\\delta>0$ and an equivariant homeomorphism\n$\\eta$ such that\n$\\eta(u)=u$ outside\n$\\mathcal{B}_{\\alpha}\\cap {\\mathcal{M}}_{c_k+2\\delta}$ and\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{lowlev}\n\\eta({{\\mathcal{M}}_{c_k+\\delta}\\cap \\mathcal{B}_{\\alpha-\\tau}})\\subset {\\mathcal{M}}_{c_k-\\delta}\\cap\n\\mathcal{B}_{\\alpha}.\n\\end{equation}\nBy definition of $c_{k}$ there exists $A\\in \\Sigma^{(k)}_{\\alpha}$ such that\n$A\\subset {\\mathcal{M}}_{c_k+\\delta}$; it follows by assumption \\eqref{ass2} (and by decreasing $\n\\delta$ if necessary) that $A\\subset {\\mathcal{M}}_{c_k+\\delta}\\cap \\mathcal{B}_{\\alpha-\\tau}$.\nThen, since $\\eta$ is an odd homeomorphism, $\\eta(A)\\in \\Sigma^{(k)}_{\\alpha}$\nand, by definition, $\\sup_{\\eta(A)}{\\mathcal{E}}_\\mu \\ge c_k$, in contradiction with\n\\eqref{lowlev}. Finally, the estimate of the Morse index is a direct consequence of the\ndefinition of genus we deal with: see \\cite{MR968487}, Proposition on page 1030, or the discussion\nat the end of Section 2 in \\cite{MR991264}.\n\\end{proof}\nWe now provide a sufficient condition to guarantee the validity of assumption\n\\eqref{ass2}.\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:ckMak}\nLet $k\\ge1$, $\\alpha>\\lambda_k(\\Omega)$ and $\\mu>0$ satisfy\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{muboundef}\n0<\\mu<\\frac{p+1}{2}\\,\\frac{\\alpha-\\lambda_{k}(\\Omega)}{M_{\\alpha,k}-|\\Omega|^{-\\frac{p-1}{2}}}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $M_{\\alpha,k}$ is defined in Theorem \\ref{thm:genus_2constr}.\nThen, for $\\tau>0$ sufficiently small, \\eqref{ass2} holds true.\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}\nWe first estimate $c_k$ from above. To this aim, we construct a subset\n$\\tilde A\\in \\Sigma^{(k)}_{\\alpha-\\tau}$ (for any $\\tau$ sufficiently small)\nas\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{Atilde}\n\\tilde A= \\left\\{\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i\\varphi_i : x=(x_1,\\dots,x_k)\\in{\\mathbb{S}}^{k-1}\\right\\},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere, as usual $\\varphi_i$ denotes the Dirichlet eigenfunction associated to\n$\\lambda_i(\\Omega)$. Indeed $\\gamma(\\tilde A)=k$ (it is homeomorphic to\n${\\mathbb{S}}^{k-1}$), and $\\max_{u\\in\\tilde A}\\|u\\|^2_{H^1_0}=\\lambda_{k}(\\Omega)<\\alpha-\\tau$ for\n$\\tau$ small. Hence Holder inequality yields\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{boundabove1}\nc_k \\leq \\sup_{\\tilde A}\\mathcal{E}_{\\mu}\\le \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_{k}(\\Omega)\n- \\frac{\\mu}{p+1}\\,|\\Omega|^{-\\frac{p-1}{2}}.\n\\end{equation}\nOn the other hand, let $A\\in\\Sigma^{(k)}_{\\alpha}$. Theorem \\ref{thm:genus_2constr}\nimplies\n\\[\n\\inf_{u\\in A} \\int_\\Omega |u|^{p+1} \\leq M_{\\alpha,k}.\n\\]\nIf moreover $A\\setminus\\mathcal{B}_{\\alpha-\\tau}\\neq\\emptyset$ we infer\n\\[\n\\sup_{A\\setminus\\mathcal{B}_{\\alpha-\\tau}}\\mathcal{E}_{\\mu}\\ge\n\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha - \\tau)  - \\frac{\\mu}{p+1} M_{\\alpha,k},\n\\]\nand taking the infimum an analogous inequality holds true for $\\hat c_k$. Comparing\nwith \\eqref{boundabove1} the lemma follows.\n\\end{proof}\nExploiting the results above, we are ready to prove our main existence results.\n\\begin{proof}[End of the proof of Theorem \\ref{thm:genus_1constr}]\nBy Theorem \\ref{infsupteo} and Lemma \\ref{lem:ckMak} the proof is completed by choosing\n\\[\n\\hat\\mu_k:=\\sup_{\\alpha>\\lambda_k(\\Omega)} \\frac{p+1}{2}\\,\\frac{\\alpha-\\lambda_{k}(\\Omega)}{M_{\\alpha,k}-|\\Omega|^{-\\frac{p-1}{2}}}.\n\\qedhere\n\\]\n\\end{proof}\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \\ref{thm:intro_GS}]\nWe write the proof in terms of ${\\mathcal{E}}_\\mu$, the theorem following by the relations in\n\\eqref{eq:main_prob_u}. Recall that, for every $u\\in \\overline{\\mathcal{B}}_\\alpha$, $\\gamma\n\\left(\\{u,-u\\}\\right)=1$. We deduce that $c_1$ is actually a local\nminimum for ${\\mathcal{E}}_\\mu$, achieved by some $u$ which solves \\eqref{eq:main_prob_u}\n(for a suitable $\\lambda$), and it can be chosen positive by symmetry.\nSince\n\\[\n\\int_\\Omega |\\nabla u|^2 + \\lambda u^2 - p\\mu|u|^{p+1}\\,dx=-(p-1)\\int_\\Omega \\mu|u|^{p+1}\\,dx<0,\n\\]\nand $H^1_0(\\Omega) = \\spann\\{u\\}\\oplus T_{u}\\mathcal{M}$, we have that $u$\nhas Morse index $1$. In a standard way, the minimality\nproperty of $u$ implies also orbital stability  of the associated solitary wave (see e.g.\n\\cite{MR677997}). Turning to the estimates for $\\hat\\mu_1 = \\hat\\rho_1^{(p-1)/2}$,\nwe can deduce it using Lemma \\ref{lem:ckMak} and Remark \\ref{rem:MvsCNp}, which yield\n\\[\n\\hat\\mu_1\\left(\\Omega,p\\right):=\\sup_{\\alpha>\\lambda_1(\\Omega)} \\frac{p+1}{2}\\,\\frac{\\alpha-\\lambda_{1}(\\Omega)}{C_{N,p} \\alpha^{\\frac{N(p-1)}{4}}-|\\Omega|^{-\\frac{p-1}{2}}}\n\\geq \\frac{p+1}{2C_{N,p}}\\,\\sup_{\\alpha>\\lambda_1(\\Omega)}\\frac{\\alpha-\\lambda_{1}\n(\\Omega)}{\\alpha^{\\beta}},\n\\]\nwhere $\\beta:=N(p-1)/4$.

For concreteness,\nlet us first consider the case $k=1$: since in such case $c_1$ is a local minimum of\n${\\mathcal{E}}_\\mu$ in $\\mathcal{M}$, and ${\\mathcal{E}}_\\mu$ is unbounded from below in $\\mathcal{M}$,\nthe critical level $\\bar c_1$ is of mountain pass type.\n\\begin{proposition}\n\\label{mpcritlev}\nLet $p>1+4/N$, $\\mu<\\hat\\mu_1$, and $u_1$ denote the local minimum point of ${\\mathcal{E}}_\\mu$\nin $\\mathcal{M}$, according to Theorems \\ref{infsupteo} and \\ref{thm:intro_GS}.

Since $u_1$ is a local minimum,\nthe functional $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mu}$ has a mountain pass structure on ${\\mathcal{M}}$;\nby recalling that $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mu}$ satisfies the P.S. condition the\nproposition follows.\n\\end{proof}\n\\begin{remark}\\label{rem:further_crit_lev}\nOne can generalize Proposition \\ref{mpcritlev} by constructing critical points via a saddle-point theorem in the following way: let us pick $k$ points $x_1, x_2,...,x_k$ in $\\Omega$ and consider the corresponding function $\\tilde w_i$; we may assume that\n$\\mathrm{supp}\\,\\tilde w_i\\cap \\mathrm{supp}\\,\\tilde w_j=\\emptyset$ for $i\\neq j$, so that these functions are orthogonal. Let us now define the subspace\n$V_k=\\mathrm{span}\\{\\varphi_1,\\dots,\\varphi_k;\\tilde w_1,...,\\tilde w_k\\}$; note that dim $V_k=2k$. Let $R$ be an operator (in $L^2(\\Omega)$) such that $R=I$ on $V_k^{\\perp}$, $Ru_i=\\tilde w_i$, $i=1,2,..,k$. Possibly after permutations, we can choose $R$ such that $R\\big |_{V_k}\\in SO(2k)$ (actually, there are infinitely many different choices of $R$). Now, since $SO(2k)$ is (arcwise) connected, there is a continuous path\n$\\tilde{\\gamma}:\\,[0,1]\\rightarrow SO(2k)$ such that $\\gamma(0)=I$, $\\gamma(1)=R\\big |_{V_k}$.\nThen, we can define the following map\n\\[\n\\gamma:\\, [0,1] \\times S^{k-1}\\rightarrow {\\mathcal{M}},\n\\quad\\quad \\gamma(s;t_1,....,t_k)=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}t_i\\tilde{\\gamma}(s)u_i,\\quad\n\\]\nwhere $\\sum_{i=1}^{k}t_i^2=1$. It is clear that $\\gamma$ is continuous; moreover,\n\\[\n\\gamma(0;t_1,....,t_k)\\in \\mathrm{span }\\{\\varphi_1,\\dots,\\varphi_k\\}\\cap {\\mathcal{M}}\n\\quad \\mathrm{and}\\quad\n\\gamma(1;t_1,....,t_k)\\in \\mathrm{span }\\{\\tilde w_1,\\dots,\\tilde w_k\\}\\cap {\\mathcal{M}}.\n\\]\nThen, by denoting with $\\Gamma_k$ the set of the above paths, if $\\mu$ is sufficiently\nsmall we obtain the critical levels\n\\[\n\\bar c_k : =\\inf_{\\gamma\\in \\Gamma_k}\\sup_{[0,1]\\times S^{k-1}}\\mathcal{E}_{\\mu}(\\gamma(s;t_1,....,t_k)).\n\\]\n\\end{remark}\n\n\n\n\\section{Results in symmetric domains}\\label{sec:symm}\n\nThis section is devoted to the proof of Theorem \\ref{pro:symm}, therefore we assume $1+4/N \\leq p < 2^*-1$.\nWe perform the proof in the case of $\\Omega=B$, but it will be clear that the main assumption on $\\Omega$ is the following:\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item[\\textbf{(T)}] there is a tiling of $\\Omega$, made by $h$ copies of a subdomain $D$, in such a way that from\n any solution $U_D$ of \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} on $D$ one can construct, using reflections, a solution $U_\\Omega$ of  \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} on $\\Omega$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThen $U_\\Omega$ has $h$ times the mass of $U_D$, and recalling Theorem \\ref{thm:intro_GS} we deduce that \\eqref{eq:main_prob_U} on $\\Omega$ is solvable for any\n$\\rho< h \\cdot D_{N,p} \\lambda_1(D)^{\\frac{2}{p-1}-\\frac{N}{2}}$.

{"text": "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\nDespite the immense popularity and availability of online video content via outlets such as Youtube and Facebook,\nmost work on object detection  \nfocuses on static images.\nGiven the breakthroughs of deep convolutional neural networks \nfor detecting objects in static images, \nthe application of these methods to video \nmight seem straightforward.\nHowever, motion blur and compression artifacts \ncause substantial frame-to-frame variability,\neven in videos that appear smooth to the eye.\nThese attributes complicate prediction tasks \nlike classification and localization.\nObject-detection models trained on images \ntend not to perform competitively \non videos owing to domain shift factors \\cite{KalogeitonFS15}. \nMoreover, object-level annotations \nin popular video data-sets \ncan be extremely sparse, \nimpeding the development \nof better video-based object detection models. \n\nGirshik \\emph{et al}\\bmvaOneDot \\cite{RCNN_girshick14CVPR} demonstrate that even given scarce labeled training data, \nhigh-capacity convolutional neural networks \ncan achieve state of the art detection performance \nif first pre-trained on a related task with abundant training data,\nsuch as 1000-way ImageNet classification.\nFollowed the pretraining, \nthe networks can be fine-tuned to a related but distinct domain. \nAlso relevant to our work, \nthe recently introduced models Faster R-CNN \\cite{Faster_RCNN_RenHG015} and You Look Only Once (YOLO) \\cite{YOLO_RedmonDGF15}\nunify the tasks of classification and localization. These methods, which are accurate and efficient,\npropose to solve both tasks through a single model,\nbypassing the separate object proposal methods \nused by R-CNN \\cite{RCNN_girshick14CVPR}. \n\nIn this paper, we introduce a method\nto extend unified object recognition and localization \nto the video domain.\nOur approach applies transfer learning \nfrom the image domain to video frames.\nAdditionally, we present a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) method\nthat refines predictions by exploiting contextual information in neighboring frames.\nIn summary, we contribute the following:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item A new method for refining a video-based object detection consisting of two parts: (i) a \\emph{pseudo-labeler}, which assigns provisional labels \nto all available video frames.\n(ii) A recurrent neural network, \nwhich reads in a sequence of provisionally labeled frames, using the contextual information to output refined predictions.\n\n\\item An effective training strategy utilizing (i) category-level weak-supervision at every time-step, (ii) localization-level strong supervision at final time-step (iii) a penalty encouraging prediction smoothness at consecutive time-steps, and (iv) similarity constraints between \\emph{pseudo-labels} and prediction output at every time-step.\n\n\\item An extensive empirical investigation demonstrating that on the YouTube Objects \\cite{youtube-Objects} dataset,\nour framework achieves mean average precision (mAP) of $68.73$ on test data, \ncompared to a best published result of $37.41$ \\cite{Tripathi_WACV16} and $61.66$\nfor a domain adapted YOLO network \\cite{YOLO_RedmonDGF15}.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\\label{sec:method}\n\nIn this work, \nwe aim to refine object detection in video \nby utilizing contextual information\nfrom neighboring video frames. \nWe accomplish this\nthrough a two-stage process.\nFirst, we train a \\emph{pseudo-labeler}, \nthat is, a domain-adapted convolutional neural network for object detection,\ntrained individually on the labeled video frames. \nSpecifically, we fine-tune the YOLO object detection network \\cite{YOLO_RedmonDGF15}, \nwhich was originally trained for the 20-class PASCAL VOC \\cite{PASCAL_VOC} dataset, \nto the Youtube-Video \\cite{youtube-Objects} dataset. \n\nWhen fine-tuning to the 10 sub-categories \npresent in the video dataset, \nour objective is to minimize \nthe weighted squared detection loss \n(equation \\ref{eqn:obj_det_loss}) \nas specified in YOLO \\cite{YOLO_RedmonDGF15}.\nWhile fine-tuning, we learn only the parameters \nof the top-most fully-connected layers,\nkeeping the $24$ convolutional layers and $4$ max-pooling layers unchanged. \nThe training takes roughly 50 epochs to converge, using the RMSProp \\cite{RMSProp} optimizer \nwith momentum of $0.9$ and a mini-batch size of $128$. \n\nAs with YOLO \\cite{YOLO_RedmonDGF15}, \nour fine-tuned $pseudo-labeler$ \ntakes $448 \\times 448$ frames as input  \nand regresses on category types and locations of possible objects\nat each one of $S \\times S$ non-overlapping grid cells.\nFor each grid cell, \nthe model outputs class conditional probabilities \nas well as $B$ bounding boxes\nand their associated confidence scores. \nAs in YOLO, we consider a \\emph{responsible} bounding box for a grid cell \nto be the one among the $B$ boxes for which the predicted area and the ground truth area \nshares the  maximum Intersection Over Union. \nDuring training, we simultaneously optimize classification and localization error \n(equation \\ref{eqn:obj_det_loss}).\nFor each grid cell, \nwe minimize the localization error \nfor the \\emph{responsible} bounding box \nwith respect to the ground truth \nonly when an object appears in that cell.  \n\nNext, we train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN),\nwith Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) \\cite{Cho14_GRU}.\nThis net takes as input \nsequences of \\emph{pseudo-labels},  \noptimizing an objective \nthat encourages both accuracy on the target frame \nand consistency across consecutive frames. \nGiven a series of \\emph{pseudo-labels} $\\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, ..., \\mathbf{x}^{(T)}$, \nwe train the RNN to generate improved predictions \n$\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}^{(1)}, ..., \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}^{(T)}$ \nwith respect to the ground truth $\\mathbf{y}^{(T)}$ \navailable only at the final step in each sequence. \nHere, $t$ indexes sequence steps and $T$ denotes the length of the sequence. \nAs output, we use a fully-connected layer  \nwith a linear activation function, \nas our problem is regression. \nIn our final experiments, \nwe use a $2$-layer GRU with $150$ nodes per layer, hyper-parameters determined on validation data. \n\n\nThe following equations \ndefine the forward pass through a GRU layer,\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}^{(t)}_l$ denotes the layer's output at the current time step, and $\\mathbf{h}^{(t)}_{l-1}$ denotes the previous layer's output at the same sequence step: \n\\begin{equation} \\label{eqn:GRU}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{r}^{(t)}_l &= \\sigma(\\mathbf{h}^{(t)}_{l-1}W^{xr}_l + \\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)}_lW^{hr}_l + \\mathbf{b}^r_l)\\\\\n\\mathbf{u}^{(t)}_l &= \\sigma(\\mathbf{h}^{(t)}_{l-1}W^{xu}_l + \\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)}_lW^{hu}_l + \\mathbf{b}^u_l)\\\\\n\\mathbf{c}^{(t)}_l &= \\sigma(\\mathbf{h}^{(t)}_{l-1}W^{xc}_l + r_t \\odot(\\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)}_lW^{hc}_l) + \\mathbf{b}^c_l)\\\\\n\\mathbf{h}^{(t)}_l &= (1-\\mathbf{u}^{(t)}_l)\\odot \\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)}_l + \\mathbf{u}^{(t)}_l\\odot \\mathbf{c}^{(t)}_l\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nHere, $\\sigma$ denotes an element-wise logistic function and $\\odot$ is the (element-wise) Hadamard product. \nThe reset gate, update gate, and candidate hidden state are denoted by $\\textbf{r}$, $\\textbf{u}$, and $\\textbf{c}$ respectively.\nFor $S = 7$ and $B=2$, \nthe pseudo-labels $\\mathbf{x}^{(t)}$ and prediction $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}^{(t)}$ both lie in $\\mathbb{R}^{1470}$. \n\\vspace{-2.5mm}\n\\subsection{Training}\nWe design an objective function (Equation \\ref{eqn:objective}) that accounts \nfor both accuracy at the target frame \nand consistency of predictions across\nadjacent time steps in the following ways:  \n\\begin{equation} \\label{eqn:objective}\n\\mbox{loss} = \\mbox{d\\_loss} + \\alpha \\cdot \\mbox{s\\_loss} + \\beta \\cdot \\mbox{c\\_loss} + \\gamma \\cdot \\mbox{pc\\_loss}\n\\end{equation}\nHere, d\\_loss, s\\_loss, c\\_loss and pc\\_loss stand for detection\\_loss, similarity\\_loss, category\\_loss and prediction\\_consistency\\_loss described in the following sections. \nThe values of the hyper-parameters $\\alpha=0.2$, $\\beta=0.2$ and $\\gamma=0.1$ \nare chosen based on the detection performance on the validation set. \nThe training converges in 80 epochs \nfor parameter updates using RMSProp \\cite{RMSProp} and momentum $0.9$. \nDuring training we use a mini-batch size of $128$ \nand sequences of length $30$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Strong Supervision at Target Frame}\nOn the final output, \nfor which the ground truth classification and localization is available, \nwe apply a multi-part object detection loss as described in YOLO \\cite{YOLO_RedmonDGF15}.\n\\vspace{-2.5mm}\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eqn:obj_det_loss}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mbox{detection\\_loss} &= \\lambda_{coord}\\sum^{S^2}_{i=0}\\sum^{B}_{j=0}\\mathbbm{1}^{obj}_{ij}\\big(\\mathit{x}^{(T)}_i - \\hat{\\mathit{x}}^{(T)}_i\\big)^2 + \\big(\\mathit{y}^{(T)}_i - \\hat{\\mathit{y}}^{(T)}_i\\big)^2 \\\\\n& + \\lambda_{coord}\\sum^{S^2}_{i=0}\\sum^{B}_{j=0}\\mathbbm{1}^{obj}_{ij}\\big(\\sqrt{w_i}^{(T)} - \\sqrt{\\hat{w}^{(T)}_i}\\big)^2 + \\big (\\sqrt{h_i}^{(T)} - \\sqrt{\\hat{h}^{(T)}_i} \\big)^2 \\\\\n& + \\sum^{S^2}_{i=0}\\sum^{B}_{j=0}\\mathbbm{1}^{obj}_{ij}(\\mathit{C}_i - \\hat{\\mathit{C}_i})^2 \\\\\n& + \\lambda_{noobj}\\sum^{S^2}_{i=0}\\sum^{B}_{j=0}\\mathbbm{1}^{noobj}_{ij}\\big(\\mathit{C}^{(T)}_i - \\hat{\\mathit{C}}^{(T)}_i\\big)^2 \\\\\n& + \\sum^{S^2}_{i=0}\\mathbbm{1}^{obj}_{i}\\sum_{c \\in classes}\\big(p_i^{(T)}(c) - \\hat{p_i}^{(T)}(c)\\big)^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbbm{1}^{obj}_{i}$ denotes \nif the object appears in cell $i$ \nand $\\mathbbm{1}^{obj}_{ij}$ \ndenotes that $j$th bounding box predictor \nin cell $i$ \nis \\emph{responsible} for that prediction. \nThe loss function penalizes classification \nand localization error differently \nbased on presence or absence of an object \nin that grid cell. \n$x_i, y_i, w_i, h_i$ corresponds \nto the ground truth bounding box center coordinates, width and height for objects in grid cell (if it exists) and $\\hat{x_i}, \\hat{y_i}, \\hat{w_i}, \\hat{h_i}$ stand for the corresponding predictions. \n$C_i$ and $\\hat{C_i}$ denote confidence score of \\emph{objectness} at grid cell $i$ for ground truth and prediction.  \n$p_i(c)$ and $\\hat{p_i}(c)$ \nstand for conditional probability \nfor object class $c$ at cell index $i$ \nfor ground truth and prediction respectively.  \nWe use similar settings for YOLO's object detection loss minimization and use values of $\\lambda_{coord} = 5$ and $\\lambda_{noobj} = 0.5$. \n\\vspace{-2.5mm} \n\n\\subsubsection{Similarity between \\emph{Pseudo-labels} and Predictions}\nOur objective function also includes \na regularizer that penalizes the dissimilarity between \\emph{pseudo-labels} and the prediction at each time frame $t$.\n\\vspace{-2.5mm}\n\\begin{equation} \\label{auto_enc_loss} \n\\mbox{similarity\\_loss} = \n\\sum^T_{t=0}\\sum^{S^2}_{i=0}\\hat{C}^{(t)}_i\\Big(\\mathbf{x}^{(t)}_i - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}_i}^{(t)}   \\Big)^2\n\\end{equation}\nHere, $\\mathbf{x}^{(t)}_i$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}_i}^{(t)}$ denote the \\emph{pseudo-labels} and predictions corresponding to the $i$-th grid cell at $t$-th time step respectively. We perform minimization of the square loss weighted by the predicted confidence score at the corresponding cell. \n\n\\subsubsection{Object Category-level Weak-Supervision}\nReplication of the static target at each sequential step has been shown to be effective in \\cite{LiptonKEW15, yue2015beyond, dai2015semi}.\nOf course, with video data, \ndifferent objects may move \nin different directions and speeds. \nYet, within a short time duration,\nwe could expect all objects to be present. \nThus we employ target replication for classification but not localization objectives.\n\nWe minimize the square loss \nbetween the categories \naggregated over all grid cells \nin the ground truth $\\mathbf{y}^{(T)}$ \nat final time step $T$ and predictions $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}^{(t)}$ \nat all time steps $t$. \nAggregated category from the ground truth \nconsiders only the cell indices \nwhere an object is present. \nFor predictions, contribution of cell $i$ \nis weighted by its predicted confidence score $\\hat{C}^{(t)}_i$. \nNote that cell indices with positive detection \nare sparse. \nThus, we consider the confidence score of each cell while minimizing the aggregated category loss.\n\\vspace{-2.5mm}\n\\begin{equation} \\label{category_supervision}\n\\mbox{category\\_loss} = \n\\sum^T_{t=0}\\bigg(\\sum_{c \\in classes} \\Big(\\sum^{S^2}_{i=0} \\hat{C}^{(t)}_i\\big(\\hat{p}^{(t)}_i(c)\\big) -  \\sum^{S^2}_{i=0}\\mathbbm{1}^{obj^{(T)}}_i \\big(p_i^{(T)}(c)\\big)\\Big) \\bigg)^2\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsubsection{Consecutive Prediction Smoothness} \nAdditionally, we regularize the model \nby encouraging smoothness of predictions \nacross consecutive time-steps.\nThis makes sense intuitively\nbecause we assume that objects\nrarely move rapidly from one frame to another. \n\\vspace{-2.5mm}\n\\begin{equation} \\label{prediction_smoothness} \n\\mbox{prediction\\_consistency\\_loss} = \n\\sum^{T-1}_{t=0}\\Big(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}_i}^{(t)} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}_i}^{(t+1)}   \\Big)^2\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\vspace{-2.5mm}\n\\subsection{Inference}\nThe recurrent neural network predicts output at every time-step. \nThe network predicts $98$ bounding boxes \nper video frame \nand class probabilities \nfor each of the $49$ grid cells. \nWe note that for every cell, \nthe net predicts class conditional probabilities  \nfor each one of the $C$ categories \nand $B$ bounding boxes. \nEach one of the $B$ predicted bounding boxes \nper cell \nhas an associated \\emph{objectness} confidence score. \nThe predicted confidence score\nat that grid is the maximum among the boxes.\nThe bounding box with the highest score \nbecomes the \\emph{responsible} prediction \nfor that grid cell $i$.      \n\nThe product of class conditional probability $\\hat{p}^{(t)}_i(c)$ for category type $c$ and \\emph{objectness} confidence score $\\hat{C}^{(t)}_i$ at grid cell $i$, \nif above a threshold, infers a detection. \nIn order for an object of category type $c$ \nto be detected for $i$-th cell \nat time-step $t$, \nboth the class conditional probability $\\hat{p}^{(t)}_i(c)$ and \\emph{objectness score} $\\hat{C}^{(t)}_i$ must be reasonably high. \n\nAdditionally, we employ Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to winnow multiple high scoring bounding boxes around an object instance \nand produce a single detection for an instance. \nBy virtue of YOLO-style prediction, NMS is not critical.  \n\n\n\\section{Experimental Results}\n\\label{sec:results}\nIn this section, \nwe empirically evaluate our model on the popular \n\\textbf{Youtube-Objects} dataset,\nproviding both quantitative results \n(as measured by mean Average Precision) \nand subjective evaluations of the model's performance, considering both successful predictions and failure cases. \n\nThe \\textbf{Youtube-Objects} dataset\\cite{youtube-Objects} \nis composed of videos collected from Youtube \nby querying for the names of 10 object classes \nof the PASCAL VOC Challenge. \nIt contains 155 videos in total \nand between 9 and 24 videos for each class. \nThe duration of each video varies \nbetween 30 seconds and 3 minutes. \nHowever, only $6087$ frames \nare annotated with $6975$ bounding-box instances. The training and test split is provided.  \n\n\\subsection{Experimental Setup}\nWe implement the domain-adaption of YOLO and \nthe proposed RNN model using Theano \\cite{Theano2016arXiv160502688short}. \nOur best performing RNN model \nuses two GRU layers of $150$ hidden units each and dropout of probability $0.5$ between layers, \nsignificantly outperforming domain-adapted YOLO alone. \nWhile we can only objectively evaluate prediction quality on the labeled frames,\nwe present subjective evaluations on sequences.\n\n\\subsection{Objective Evaluation}\nWe compare our approach with other methods evaluated on the Youtube-Objects dataset. \nAs shown in Table \\ref{table:per_category_results} and Table \\ref{table:final_mAP},\nDeformable Parts Model (DPM) \\cite{FelzenszwalbMR_CVPR_2008})-based detector reports \\cite{KalogeitonFS15} mean average precision below $30$, \nwith especially poor performance \nin some categories such as \\emph{cat}.  \nThe method of Tripathi \\emph{et al}\\bmvaOneDot (VPO) \\cite{Tripathi_WACV16} \nuses consistent video object proposals \nfollowed by a domain-adapted AlexNet classifier (5 convolutional layer, 3 fully connected) \\cite{AlexNet12} in an R-CNN \\cite{RCNN_girshick14CVPR}-like framework,\nachieving mAP of $37.41$. \nWe also compare against YOLO ($24$ convolutional layers, 2 fully connected layers),\nwhich unifies the classification and localization tasks,\nand achieves mean Average Precision over $55$. \n\nIn our method, we adapt YOLO to generate \\emph{pseudo-labels} for all video frames,\nfeeding them as inputs to the refinement RNN.\nWe choose YOLO as the \\emph{pseudo-labeler}\nbecause it is the most accurate \namong feasibly fast image-level detectors. \nThe domain-adaptation improves YOLO's performance, \nachieving mAP of $61.66$. \n\nOur model with RNN-based prediction refinement, \nachieves superior aggregate mAP to all baselines. \nThe RNN refinement model using both input-output similarity, category-level weak-supervision, and prediction smoothness performs best,\nachieving $\\mbox{68.73}$ mAP.\nThis amounts to a relative improvement of $\\mbox{11.5\\%}$ over the best baselines.\nAdditionally, the RNN improves \ndetection accuracy on most individual categories (Table \\ref{table:per_category_results}).\n\n\\begin{table} \\label{table:per_category_results} \n\\centering\n\\footnotesize\n\\begin{tabular}{lllllllllll}\n\\multicolumn{11}{c}{\\textbf{Average Precision on 10-categories}} \\\\ \\midrule \n    Methods & airplane & bird & boat & car & cat & cow & dog & horse & mbike & train \\\\ \\midrule\n    DPM\\cite{FelzenszwalbMR_CVPR_2008} & 28.42 & 48.14 & 25.50 & 48.99 & 1.69 & 19.24 & 15.84 & 35.10 & 31.61 & 39.58 \\\\\n    VOP\\cite{Tripathi_WACV16} & 29.77 & 28.82 & 35.34 & 41.00 & 33.7 & 57.56 & 34.42 & 54.52 & 29.77 & 29.23 \\\\\n    YOLO\\cite{YOLO_RedmonDGF15} & 76.67 & 89.51 & 57.66 & 65.52 & 43.03 & 53.48 & 55.81 & 36.96 & 24.62 & 62.03 \\\\\n    DA YOLO & \\textbf{83.89} & \\textbf{91.98} & 59.91 & 81.95 & 46.67 & 56.78 & 53.49 & 42.53 & 32.31 & 67.09 \\\\\n \\midrule\n    RNN-IOS & 82.78 & 89.51 & 68.02 & \\textbf{82.67} & 47.88 & 70.33 & 52.33 & 61.52 & 27.69 & \\textbf{67.72} \\\\\n    RNN-WS & 77.78 & 89.51 & \\textbf{69.40} & 78.16 & 51.52 & \\textbf{78.39} & 47.09 & 81.52 & 36.92 & 62.03 \\\\\n    RNN-PS & 76.11 & 87.65 & 62.16 & 80.69 & \\textbf{62.42} & 78.02 & \\textbf{58.72} & \\textbf{81.77} & \\textbf{41.54} & 58.23 \\\\ \\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Per-category object detection results   for the Deformable Parts Model (DPM),\nVideo Object Proposal based AlexNet (VOP), \nimage-trained YOLO (YOLO), \ndomain-adapted YOLO (DA-YOLO). \nRNN-IOS regularizes on input-output similarity, \nto which RNN-WS adds category-level weak-supervision, \nto which RNN-PS adds a regularizer encouraging prediction smoothness.}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\\begin{table}[h] \\label{table:final_mAP} \n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{llllllll}\n\\multicolumn{8}{c}{\\textbf{mean Average Precision on all categories}} \\\\ \n\\midrule\n     Methods & DPM & VOP & YOLO & DA YOLO & RNN-IOS & RNN-WS & RNN-PS\\\\ \\midrule\n    mAP & 29.41 & 37.41 & 56.53 & \\textbf{61.66} & 65.04 & 67.23 & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{68.73}}\\\\ \\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Overall detection results on Youtube-Objects dataset.

{"text": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe wave-particle duality is an alternative statement of the complementarity principle, and it establishes the relation between \\ankb{corpuscular and undulatory}{the corpuscular and the ondulatory} nature of quantum entities \\cite{Bohr1928}. It can be illustrated in a two-way interferometer, where the apparatus can be set to observe \\ankb{particle}{the particle} behavior when a single path is \\ankb{taken}{taken,} or wave-like behavior, when the impossibility to define a path is shown by the interference. A modern approach to the wave-particle duality includes quantitative relations between quantities that represent the possible \\textit{a priori} knowledge of the which-way information (\\ankb{predictability}{predicability}) and the ``quality'' of the interference fringes (\\ankb{Visibility}{visibility}). Several publications in the literature \\cite{Bohr1928, Wootters1979, Summhammer1987, Greenberger1988, Mandel1991} contributed to the formulation of the quantitative analysis of the wave-particle duality. For a bipartite system\\ankb{ entanglement, the quantum correlations between each part, can play a role. Such correlations can}{, entanglement can} give an extra which-way (path) information about the interferometric possibilities. The quantitative relations for systems composed by two particles were \\ankb{}{extensively} studied in \\cite{Jaeger1993, Jaeger1995, Englert1996, Englert2000, Scully1989, Scully1991, Mandel1995, Tessier2005, Jakob2010, Miatto2015,Bagan2016, Coles2016}. Therefore, \\ankb{understand}{understanding} the behavior of such quantities, in various regimes and situations, is essential to answer fundamental and/or technological questions of the quantum theory \\cite{Greenberger1999}.\n\n\\alams{The Complementarity quantities can present interesting dynamical behaviors,}{Concerning the study of the dynamical behavior of complementarity quantities,} an example is the so-called \\textit{quantum eraser}, \\alams{where an increase or preservation of the visibility of an interferometer experiment is caused when the ``which-way'' information is erased.}{\\ankb{ i.e. an increasing or preservation of the \\ankb{Visibility}{visibility} in an interferometric scheme (or the ``erasure'' of the which-way information probably stored in the initial state).}{ where an increase or preservation of the visibility of an interferometer experiment is caused when the which-path information is erased.}} Since its proposal \\cite{Scully1982}\\ankb{ this phenomena}{, it} has \\ankb{investigated it carefully,}{been investigated carefully} both theoretically and experimentally (see for example Refs. \\cite{Englert2000, Scully1991, Mandel1995, Storey1994, Wiseman1995, Mir2007, Luis1998, Busch2006, Rossi2013, Walborn2002, Mir2007, Teklemariam2001, Teklemariam2002, Kim2000, Salles2008, Heuer2015}). In \\ankb{a recent work }{Ref.~}\\cite{Rossi2013}, the authors explore the quantum eraser problem in \\ankb{multipartite}{a multipartite} model\\ankb{, where two cavities ($q_A+q_B$), which will be taken as a two qubit system $A + B$, in an initial maximally entangled state (and therefore with zero \\ankb{Visibility}{visibility}), couple through a Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian to $N$ two-level atoms (we will call the global system as $q_A + q_B + R$, where all the individual systems are qubits)}{. Initially a bipartite qubit system is prepared in a maximally entangled state and interacts with $N$ other qubits. This model can be implemented considering the qubits of interest the cavity modes of two cavities and the $N$ qubits as two-level atoms}. In this work \\cite{Rossi2013}, an increase of visibility is achieved by performing appropriate projective measurements. An intrinsic relation between the complementarity quantities and the performed measurements is outlined: since \\ankb{they}{the measurements} were made in order to obtain an \\ankb{increasing}{increase} of the \\ankb{Visibility}{visibility}, the remaining quantities (Entanglement as measured by the concurrence, and the predictability) must obey a ``complementary'' behavior. In that case, \\ankb{Visibility}{visibility} and predictability increases, and entanglement decreases, since the measurements are made in order to \\ankb{establishes}{establish} the quantum eraser. In Reference \\cite{Rossi2013} only the maximization of the visibility was considered, in the present work we extend the analysis and consider maximization of predictability, visibility and concurrence. Also, in the previous work \\cite{Rossi2013}, only one value of the coupling constant was considered. In this contribution we consider a second coupling regime that allows for the comparison between stronger and weaker interactions.\n\nSome questions may arise from the analysis presented in \\cite{Rossi2013}: how is the behavior of the \\ankb{Visibility}{visibility}, predictability and Entanglement, for different strengths of the coupling between the cavities and the $N$ atoms? \\ankb{There are any difference in this behavior,}{Is there any difference in this behavior} if one measure the qubits in order to maximize another complementarity quantity? For finite $N$, could \\alams{this behavior}{the behavior of entanglement} resemble the reservoir (dissipative) limit? Moreover, one can think about a three-part control scheme: initially parts $A$ and $B$ possesses a maximally entanglement state, constituted by two qubits $q_A$ and $q_B$, respectively. A third part $R$ may have, in principle, \\emph{full} control of a group of $N$-qubits (each one we call as $q_i$); i.e. $R$ may control: (i) the initial state of each qubit $q_i$, (ii) the interaction strength between $q_i$ and $q_B$ and (iii) the measurement basis where each $q_i$ could be projected by $R$. Here we will focus in the control of item (iii), therefore the initial state of all $q_i$ and the coupling strenght will be fixed for each realization of the scheme. Thus, part $R$ is able to control which complementarity quantity of part $A$ they ($A$ and $R$) would like to maximize. For instance, if $A$ and $R$ desire that $q_A$ is in a superposition state, $R$ can choose which basis he/she will project each qubit in order to accomplish the task (quantum eraser task \\cite{Rossi2013}). However, now $R$ and $A$ are able to choose another complementarity quantity: if they would like to obtain and/or maintain an Entangled state between $A$ and $B$, $R$ may project each $q_i$ in a basis chosen in order obtain an state nearly maximally Entangled (the same idea follows for the predictability). More than that, since part $R$ can adjust the strenght of the interaction between $q_B$ and $q_i$, he/she can study what is the best option of coupling to do each task (together with the freedom to choose the basis of projection). In that way, parts $A$, $B$ and $R$ are able to study in details the behavior of the complementarity quantities, for a variety of conditions.\n\nIn the present work we answer the questions and provide a useful tool to implement the control scheme mentioned above, considering a similar model\\ankb{: the interaction between}{ compound by} two entangled qubits, $q_{A}$ and $q_{B}$, and a third system ($R$) which is composed by $N$ qubits. \\ankb{They interact, one at the time, with the qubit B. The $N$ qubits of $R$ can be measured after the interaction.}{Each qubit of $R$ interacts one at a time with only qubit $B$ and can be projectively measured afterwards.} It is well known that \\ankb{when the interaction time $t\\rightarrow 0$ and on the coupling strength $g\\rightarrow \\infty$ the subsystem}{in the limit that the interaction time $t\\rightarrow 0$ and that the coupling strength $g\\rightarrow \\infty$, the system} $R$ will play the role of a reservoir \\cite{Carmichael1999, Breuer2007, Jacobs1998}. As it is possible to measure each qubit of system $R$ after the interaction, we can control the evolution of $q_{A}$ and $q_{B}$, induced by the interaction with $R$, by selecting an adequate sequence of results of measurements performed in the qubits of $R$. Such control would allow us to make $q_{A}$ and $q_{B}$ approach a chosen asymptotic state. This scheme can be implemented in cavity-QED system, where $q_{A}$ and $q_{B}$ would be cavity modes, prepared in an entangled state with one excitation, and $N$ two level atoms, interacting with the cavities one at the time, would play the role of the qubits that compose the system $R$. We consider the complementarity quantities \\cite{Jakob2010} concurrence, predictability and \\ankb{Visibility}{visibility} to guide the manipulation over $R$ and to quantify the information present in each subsystem. \\ankb{To manipulate the evolution we consider three kinds of sequences of experimental results: The first maximizes the Visibility, the second maximizes the predictability and the third maximizes the concurrence.}{Each quantity is maximized by a different set of projective measurements on $R$.} We also consider two regimes for the strength of the coupling constant $g$ between $q_B$ and each qubit of $R$, $g= \\frac{1}{4}$ and $g= 4$. \\ankb{We perform a numerical calculation in order to find the right sequence of measurement that lead to the maximization of a given quantity.}{} \\alams{We show that for $g= \\frac{1}{4}$ it is possible to manipulate the evolution to make the subsystem of interest $q_{A}+q_{B}$ to approach a chosen asymptotic state. For $g T = 2 \\pi \\times 4$, the subsystem $q_{A}+q_{B}$ always tends to a state with no excitation in $q_{B}$, independently of the chosen sequence of measurement results in $R$. Therefore, when the coupling constant increases, the result of the interaction between the system of interest and $R$ is similar to the interaction with a thermal reservoir. We consider also the case with no maximization, assuming that \\ankb{the}{} all measurements are made in the same basis while we observe the complementarity quantities behavior. Finally we show how the information is distributed over the global system, and how this distribution changes after the measurements in $R$.}{\\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,0.00}{We show that for $g = \\frac{1}{4}$ it is possible to maximize the concurrence of the subsystem $q_A+q_B$, while for $g T= 2 \\pi \\times 4$ (i.e. $g = 4$) the concurrence decays quickly and the maximization is not possible. When the coupling constant increases, the behavior of concurrence is similarly to the one expected if the system $R$ had the properties of a thermal reservoir. However, the visibility shows a different behavior, its maximization is more efficient for $g = 4$. This behavior is caused by the different which-way information distribution produced by the interactions with $g = 4$ and $g=\\frac{1}{4}$, as we shown in the last section. Numerical calculation shows that, for $g = 4$, the first two qubits of $R$ retain a large amount of which-way information, that was initially present in $q_B$. When measurements that maximizes the \nvisibility are performed, the which-way information is erased, and the visibility of $q_A$ increases \nquickly. For $g=\\frac{1}{4}$ the which-way information is distributed almost equally among the qubits of $R$, therefore less information is erased and consequently measurements that maximize the visibility are less efficient.}}\n\nThe paper is organized as \\ankb{follow}{follows}: in section \\ref{model} we \\ankb{present the model in details, including the complete dynamics of the global system and}{briefly review the model and the definition of} the principal quantities studied: \\ankb{Visibility}{visibility}, concurrence and predictability. \\ankb{We also study in this section}{Moreover, we analyze} the distinguishability between different parts of the global system\\ankb{ ($q_A$ and $q_B$, $q_A$ and the i-esim qubit of $R$)}{}. In subsection \\ref{digression} we briefly review the case where $q_A+q_B$ interacts in a dissipative reservoir, and how the complementarity quantities behave in this case. Section \\ref{results} shows how we implement the projective measurements in $R$, and present our results and discussions for the behavior of the complementarity quantities and for the variation of distinguishability (after and before the measurements). In section \\ref{conclusion} we conclude our work.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n{\\includegraphics[scale=0.32]{figure_1.pdf}}\n\\caption{(Color online) A schematic figure of our proposal.

The projective measures follows after $R$ decides which complementarity quantity of $A$ and $B$ will be maximized.}\n\\label{scheme}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Model and definitions}\\label{model}\n\nLet us consider that initially qubits $q_A$ and $q_B$ were prepared in the entangled state $\\ket{\\psi(0)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} (\\ket{0_A 1_B} + \\ket{1_A 0_B})$ and a third system $R$ composed by \\ankb{$N$-qubits}{$N$ qubits}, prepared all in the ground state $\\ket 0$. Each qubit of $R$ interacts one at a time with $q_B$ and after a sequence of these interactions, the information, initially stored in $q_A$ and $q_B$, will be distributed over the \\ankb{$N$-qubits of $R$}{$N$ qubits of $R$} and qubits $q_A$ and $q_B$. As an example of our interaction model, consider the following dynamics governing the interaction of an atom (between a total of $N$ atoms) and a cavity ($q_B$) (see Figure \\ref{scheme}). The Hamiltonian that gives the interaction between the $k$-th atom and $q_B$ is $\\hat{H}^{(k)}= \\omega \\hat{b}^{\\dagger }\\hat{b}+ \\frac{\\omega}{2}\\hat{\\sigma}_{z}^{(k)}+ g (\\hat{b}^{\\dagger}\\hat{\\sigma}_{-}^{(k)}+\\hat{b}\\hat{\\sigma}_{+}^{(k)}),$ where $\\hat{b}^{\\dagger }$ ($\\hat{b}$) corresponds to  the creation (annihilation) operator for $q_B$, $\\omega $ their transition frequency, $\\hat{\\sigma}_{z}^{(k)}=|1^{(k)}\\rangle\\langle 1^{(k)}|-|0^{(k)}\\rangle\\langle 0^{(k)}|$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_{-}^{(k)}=|0^{(k)}\\rangle\\langle 1^{(k)}|$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_{+}^{(k)}=|1^{(k)}\\rangle\\langle 0^{(k)}|$, \\ankb{}{and} $g$ the coupling constant for the interaction between the $k$-th qubit of $R$ and $q_B$. As the initial state has one excitation and the Hamiltonian preserves the excitation number, the states of mode $B$ can be written in the basis $\\lbrace\\vert 0 \\rangle , \\vert 1 \\rangle\\rbrace$. Although constant in each preparation, we let the parameter $g$ free in order to quantify the strength of the interaction, since we will analyze different coupling regimes and the correspondent behavior of the Complementarity quantities. In this model, $\\left|0^{(k)} \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|1^{(k)}\\right\\rangle$ stand for the levels $0$ and $1$ of the $k$-th interacting atom, respectively.\n\nAfter $n$ qubits of $R$ have interacted with $q_B$ (note the difference between $N$, the total number of qubits that are able to interact, and $n$, the number of qubits that will interact at a given time) the global system is left in the state \\cite{Rossi2013}\n\\begin{eqnarray} \\ket{\\psi^{(n)}} &=&\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} \\Big( a^n \\ket{0_{A}} \\ket{0_{res}} \\ket{1_{B}} + \\Gamma \\ket{0_{A}}\n\\ket{1_{res}} \\ket{0_{B}} + \\nonumber \\\\ && + \\ket{1_{A}} \\ket{0_{res}} \\ket{0_{B}} \\Big), \\label{psin}\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $a = \\cos\\left( \\frac{g T}{N} \\right)$ and $b = - i \\sin \\left( \\frac{g T}{N} \\right)$, assuming the same interaction time between each qubit of $R$ and $q_{B}$, given by $\\Delta\nt=\\frac{T}{N}$. To simplify the notation we define a normalized state with one excitation in subsystem $R$:  $\\ket{1_{res}}=\n\\frac{1}{\\Gamma} \\left( a^{n-1} b \\ket{n} + \\ldots + a b \\ket{2} + b\\ket{1} \\right)$\\ankb{ with}{, where} $\\Gamma^{2} = 1 - a^{2n}$\\ankb{ and}{,} $\\ket{i}= \\ket{0_1 0_2 \\ldots 0_{i-1} ~1_i ~ 0_{i+1} \\ldots 0_n}$ represents a state with an excitation in the $i$-th qubit and $\\ket{0_{res}} = \\ket{0_1 0_2 \\ldots 0_n}$.\n\nFor a general pure two qubit state \\cite{Englert1996, Englert2000, Jakob2010}:\n$\\ket{\\Psi} = \\gamma_1 \\ket{00} + \\gamma_2 \\ket{01} + \\gamma_3 \\ket{10} + \\gamma_4 \\ket{11},$\nthe complementary quantities are defined in the following way. The concurrence, which is related to the quantum correlation between the parts, is given by $C(\\ket{\\Psi}) = 2 \\abs{\\gamma_1 \\gamma_4 - \\gamma_2 \\gamma_3}$. The coherence between two orthogonal states gives the visibility, defined by $V = 2 \\abs{\\bra{\\Psi}\\sigma_{+}\\ket{\\Psi}} = 2 \\abs{\\gamma_1 \\gamma_3^* + \\gamma_2 \\gamma_4^*}$.

We consider that the interaction time between each qubit of $R$ and $q_B$ is equal, given by $\\Delta\nt=\\frac{T}{N}$. We also assume that $0<\\Delta t<\\pi/2g.$ After $N$ interactions the reduced state in the subsystem $q_A$ is a statistical mixture $\\rho_{A}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\vert 0_{A} \\rangle \\langle 0_{A} \\vert + \\vert 1_{A} \\rangle \\langle 1_{A} \\vert\\right)$, therefore $V_{q_A} = 0$ and $P_{q_A} = 0$. The concurrence can be calculated from the reduced state of the subsystem $q_A, q_B$ and is given by $C_{q_A, q_B} = a^N$.

The same procedure is carried out in order to maximize the \\ankb{Visibility}{visibility} or the predictability.

In Table \\ref{table} we show the states after $n$ interactions ($n = 1, 2$ and $10$), and after performing the maximization procedures.

It is possible, therefore, to maintain the system $q_A + q_B$ in an approximately maximal Entangled state, notwithstanding the qubits of $R$ became dynamically correlated with $q_A$ and $q_B$ (Equation \\eqref{rhon}).

One can see clearly the Complementarity behavior between the quantities in all plots.\n\nNote in Figure \\ref{alfaequal}a ($g T = 2 \\pi \\times 4$), when $\\theta = \\frac{m \\pi}{2}$ ($m \\in$ Integer) for large values of $n$, the predictability has values near unity, while the \\ankb{Visibility}{visibility} is near zero (the concurrence is negligible in this regime, as pointed out previously). This can be seen through Equation \\eqref{rhon}: if $\\theta = \\frac{m \\pi}{2}$ for odd values of $m$ the state after $n$ measurements is approximately $\\rho_{m} \\thickapprox \\ket{1_A 0_B}$, while for $m$ assuming even values the state will become $\\rho_{m} \\thickapprox \\ket{0_A 0_B}$, explicitly the maximum values of the predictability in Figure \\ref{alfaequal}a. The same argument can be used for the \\ankb{Visibility}{visibility} in this regime, but in this case $\\theta = \\frac{(2m+1) \\pi}{4}$ ($m$ Integer) and the final state tends to $\\rho_{m} \\thickapprox \\frac{\\ket{1_A 0_B} + \\ket{0_A 1_B}}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nFigure \\ref{alfaequal}b, on the other hand, shows the Complementarity quantities in the weak coupling regime. It is noticeable that one can sustain the state in the maximal entangled state by performing specific measurements ($\\theta = m \\pi$, with $m$ Integer). This can be achieved since for this coupling regime only little information about the initial state is captured by the interaction between $q_B$ and $q_i$ (Subsection \\ref{distsec}). The large values for the predictability (and consequently small values of \\ankb{Visibility}{visibility} and concurrence), when $\\theta = \\frac{m \\pi}{2}$ (where $m$ is an odd Integer), can be understood in the same sense as the case of $g T = 2 \\pi \\times 4$ (Figure \\ref{alfaequal}a), where the state is approximately $\\rho_{m} \\thickapprox \\ket{1_A 0_B}$.\n\n\\subsection{Information distribution - Distinguishability}\\label{distsec}\n\nIn this section we use the distinguishability to quantify the information stored by each subsystem. We show how this quantity varies as one evaluate the measurements. We are concerned in how the information stored in some parts of the global system behaves, given that $n$ measurements are performed in the subsystem $R$. The distinguishability is calculated before and after $n$ measurements, and we show the curves that illustrate the behavior of this quantity for the maximizations of $V$, $P$ and $C$.\n\nFigures \\ref{dist}a and \\ref{dist}b show how the distinguishability is distributed in the $N$ qubits, i.e. $D^{(n)}_{q_A,q_i}$: \\begin{eqnarray} D_{q_{A},q_i}^{(n)} &=& \\operatorname{tr}_{q_i} \\Big\\{ \\Big|\n\\frac{1}{2} a^{2n} \\ket{0_i} \\bra{0_i} + \\abs{a^{i-1} b}^2 \\ket{1_i}\n\\bra{1_i} + \\nonumber \\\\ && + (\\abs{a^{n-1} b}^2 + \\ldots  + \\abs{a^{i-2} b}^2 + \\nonumber \\\\ &&+\n\\abs{a^i b} + \\ldots + \\abs{b}^2) \\ket{0_i}\n\\bra{0_i} - \\ket{0_i} \\bra{0_i} \\Big| \\Big\\}  = \\nonumber \\\\ &=& \\abs{a^{i-1} b}^2. \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{dist_eq}\\end{eqnarray} This relation gives the amount of information the $i$-th qubit possess about the initial state. Both Figures are independent of the maximization procedure. Note that for $g T = \\frac{2 \\pi}{4}$, Figure \\ref{dist}b, the information is almost equally distributed in all the qubits of $R$. For coupling $g T = 2 \\pi \\times 4$, the first qubits that interacted with $q_B$ retain a large amount of information from $q_A + q_B$ (Figure \\ref{dist}a). Comparing the results of Figures \\ref{maxcon}a and \\ref{dist}a, we can argue that, if $g T = 2 \\pi \\times 4$ (for high coupling intensity between $R$ and $q_B$), the first qubits of $R$ that interact with $q_B$ ``extract'' sufficient information, that was initially stored only in $q_A + q_B$. Therefore, the global system ($R + q_A + q_B$) becomes strongly correlated, leading the concurrence between $q_A$ and $q_B$ diminishes rapidly, compared with the case $g T = \\frac{2 \\pi}{4}$ (Figures \\ref{maxvis}a, \\ref{maxpre}a and \\ref{maxcon}a).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n{\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{distingui_g.pdf}\\label{dist_a\n}\n{\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{distingui_p.pdf}\\label{dist_b}\n}\n\\caption{Distinguishability between $q_A$ and the $i$-th qubit of $R$, as a function of \\emph{n}, i.e. how much information about the initial state the qubit $i$ have.

We can see that the measurements that maximizes the visibility, erases the information stored by the qubits of $R$. Notice that in \\ref{maxdeltaT}a for $N=4$ the the information of the global system is approximately zero, this is in accord with Figure \\ref{maxvis}a that shows visibility approximately $1$ for $N=4$.  In figure \\ref{maxdeltaT}b the stabilization of the curve shows that the information erased is limited, because it is equally distributed among the qubits of $R$, as it is shown in Figure \\ref{dist}b, therefore it is erased by small amounts after each measurements. Measurements that maximizes predictability and concurrence show no variation of information before and after measurements of the qubits, therefore, they do not erase information form the system $R$.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\\label{conclusion}\n\nIn this work we have proposed and discussed in details a scheme to observe the behavior of Complementarity quantities (concurrence, \\ankb{Visibility}{visibility} and predictability) of a two qubit system, initially maximally entangled, after two steps: one of the qubits ($q_B$) interacts with $R$ (composed by $N$ other qubits -- $q_i$); after the interaction, projective measurements are made in each qubit of $R$ in order to maximize a given quantity. We observe that, if the coupling strength between $q_B$ and $R$ is considerable, the concurrence behaves similarly as a system of two qubits coupled to a thermal reservoir, even though our subsystem $R$ is composed by a finite number of qubits $N$. On the other hand, if the coupling is ``small'' (compared to the previous one), the system entanglement may as well be preserved. \\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,0.00}{The visibility however shows a different behavior, when the coupling is stronger its maximization is more effective.} To explicit these results, we show some intermediate states for different couplings and number of interactions. The differences of the behavior can be understood from the distribution of information over the global system, as measured by the Distinguishability between $q_A+q_i$. We also studied the variation of distinguishability (before and after the measurements) for the global system and for the initial qubits $q_A + q_B$, making a connection between the information stored in each part of the system and the corresponding behavior of the Complementarity quantities. Note that the presented model may be feasible experimentally. One can, in principle, call qubits $q_A$ and $q_B$ as the modes inside microwave cavities, which nowadays are constructed with a lifetime of approximately $0.1$ seconds \\cite{Gleyzes2007, Kuhr2007}. The qubits of the subsystem $R$ could represent two-level atoms in a QED experiment, for instance. The interaction time between each atom ($q_i$) and the mode $q_B$ is of the order of $10^{-5} s$ \\cite{Brune1996}. So, for the $10$ qubits of our model, the effect would be in fact visible and dissipation can be neglected.\n\nWe showed how to fully control and prepare maximized states for different complementarity quantities. Since many parts are involved in this control scheme, this could have applications for protocols of quantum information, for example as protocols of bit commitment \\cite{bitcomm1, bitcomm2}, where Alice wants to save safely the information of her bit for some time, but wants to reveal it later on to Bob. In this case, we could imagine that Alice would have access to part R and Bob, on the other hand, would have access to qubit A  and B.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nThe authors would like to thank the support from the Brazilian agencies CNPq and CAPES (CAPES (6842/2014-03); CNPq (470131/2013-6)).

In the present paper we study some properties of these spaces. The subject is closely related to the classical Whitney problems, see \\cite{W1, W2},  asking about the characterization of trace spaces of $C^k$ functions on ${\\mbf R}^n$ (see survey \\cite{F3} and book \\cite{BB2} and references therein for recent developments in the area). Some of the main results of the theory can be reformulated in terms of certain geometric characteristics of spaces $G_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$, see sections~1.2 and 1.3.\n\n\n\\subsection{Finiteness Principle} For $C_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$ this principle was conjectured by Yu.~Brudnyi and P.~Shvartsman in the 1980s in the \nfollowing form (cf. \\cite[p.\\,210]{F3}).\\smallskip\n\n\\noindent \\textsl{\\large{Finiteness Principle}.}  To decide whether a given $f:S\\rightarrow{\\mbf R}$, $S\\subset{\\mbf R}^n$, extends to a function $F\\in C_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$, it is enough to look at all restrictions $f|_{S'}$, where $S'\\subset S$ is  an arbitrary $d$-element subset. Here $d$ is an integer constant depending only on $k$ and $n$.\\smallskip\n\nMore precisely, if $f|_{S'}$ extends to a function $F^{S'}\\in C_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$ of norm at most $1$ (for each $S'\\subset S$ with at most $d$ elements), then $f$ extends to a function $F\\in C_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$, whose norm is bounded by a constant depending only on $k$ and $n$.\\smallskip\n\nFor $k=0$ (the Lipschitz case) the McShane extension theorem \\cite{McS} implies the Finiteness Principle with the optimal constant $d=2$. \nAlso, for $n=1$ the Finiteness Principle is valid with the optimal constant $d=k+2$. The result is essentially due to Merrien  \\cite{M}.\n\nIn the multidimensional case the Finiteness Principle was proved by Yu.~Brudnyi and Shvartsman for $k=1$ with the optimal constant $d=3\\cdot 2^{n-1}$, see \\cite{BS1}. In the early 2000s the Finiteness Principle was proved by C.~Fefferman for all $k$ and $n$ for regular moduli of continuity $\\omega$ (i.e., $\\omega(1)=1$), see \\cite{F1}. The upper bound for the constant $d$ in  the Fefferman proof was reduced later to $d=2^{ k+n \\choose k}$ by Bierstone and P. Milman \\cite{BM} and independently and by a different method by Shvartsman \\cite{S}. The obtained results (and the Finiteness Principle in general) admit the following reformulation in terms of geometric characteristics of closed unit balls $B_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$ of $G_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$. Specifically,\nlet $B_b^{k,\\omega}(S;m)\\subset B_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$, $m\\in{\\mbf N}$, be the balanced closed convex hull of the union of all finite-dimensional balls $B_b^{k,\\omega}(S')\\subset G_b^{k,\\omega}(S')$, $S'\\subset S$, ${\\rm card}\\, S'\\le m$.\n\n\\begin{Th}\\label{teo1.5}\nThere exist constants $d\\in{\\mbf N}$ and  $c\\in (1,\\infty)$ such that\n\\[\nB_b^{k,\\omega}(S;d)\\subset B_b^{k,\\omega}(S)\\subset c\\cdot B_b^{k,\\omega}(S;d).\n\\]\nHere for $k=0$, $d=2$ (-\\,optimal) and $c=1$, for $n=1$, $d=k+2$ (-\\,optimal) and $c$ depends on $k$ only, for $k=1$, $d=3\\cdot 2^{n-1}$ (-\\,optimal) and $c$ depends on $k$ and $n$ only, and for $k\\ge 2$, $d=2^{ k+n \\choose k}$ and $c=\\frac{\\tilde c}{\\omega(1)}$, where $\\tilde c$ depends on $k$ and $n$ only.\n\\end{Th}\n\n\\subsection{Complementability of Spaces ${\\mathbf G_b^{k,\\omega}(S)}$} We begin with a result describing bounded linear operators on $G_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$. To this end,\nfor a Banach space $X$ by $C_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n;X)$ we denote the Banach space of $X$-valued $C^k$ functions on ${\\mbf R}^n$ with norm defined similarly to that of Definition \\ref{def1} with absolute values replaced by norms $\\|\\cdot\\|_X$ in $X$.\nLet $\\mathcal L\\bigl(X_1;X_2\\bigr)$ stand for the Banach space of bounded linear operators between Banach spaces $X_1$ and $X_2$ equipped with the operator norm.\n\\begin{Th}\\label{te1.6}\nThe restriction map to the set $\\{\\delta_x^0\\, :\\, x\\in {\\mbf R}^n\\}\\subset G_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$ determines an isometric isomorphism between  $\\mathcal L\\bigl(G_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n);X\\bigr)$ and $C_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n;X)$.\n\\end{Th}\n Let $q_S: C_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)\\rightarrow C_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$ be the quotient map induced by the restriction of functions on ${\\mbf R}^n$ to $S$. A right inverse $T\\in {\\mathcal L}(C_b^{k,\\omega}(S); C_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n))$ for $q_S$ (i.e., $q_S\\circ T={\\rm id}$) is called a {\\em linear extension operator}.

For $k=0$ (the Lipschitz case) the  Whitney-Glaeser linear extension operators $C_{b}^{0,\\omega}(S)\\rightarrow C_{b}^{0,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$, see \\cite{Gl}, have depth $d$ depending on $n$ only and norms bounded by a constant depending on $n$ only.\nIn the 1990s bounded linear extension operators $C_{b}^{1,\\omega}(S)\\rightarrow C_{b}^{1,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$ of depth $d$ depending on $n$ only with norms bounded by a constant depending on $n$ only were constructed by Yu.~Brudnyi and Shvartsman \\cite{BS2}.

The first example of a space which fails to have the approximation property was\nconstructed by Enflo \\cite{E}. Since Enflo's work several other examples of such spaces were\nconstructed, for the references see, e.g., \\cite{L}. \n\nA Banach space has the $\\lambda$-{\\em approximation property}, $1\\le\\lambda<\\infty$, if it has the approximation property with the approximating\nfinite rank operators of norm $\\le\\lambda$. A Banach space is said to have the {\\em bounded approximation property}, if it has the $\\lambda$-approximation property for some $\\lambda$. If $\\lambda=1$, then the space is said to have the {\\em metric approximation property}. \n\n\nEvery Banach spaces with a basis has the bounded approximation property. Also, it is known that the approximation property does not imply the bounded approximation property, see \\cite{FJ}. It was established by Pe\\l czy\\'nski \\cite{P} that a separable Banach space has the bounded approximation property if and only if it is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of a separable Banach space with a basis.\n\nNext, for Banach spaces $X,Y$ by  ${\\mathcal F}(X,Y)\\subset {\\mathcal L}(X,Y)$ we denote the subspace of linear bounded operators of finite rank $X\\to Y$.\nLet us consider the trace mapping $V$ from the projective tensor product $Y^*\\hat{\\otimes}_\\pi X\\to {\\mathcal F}(X,Y)^*$ defined by\n\\[\n(Vu)(T)={\\rm trace}(Tu),\\quad\\text{where}\\quad u\\in Y^*\\hat{\\otimes}_\\pi X,\\ T\\in {\\mathcal F}(X,Y),\n\\]\nthat is, if $u=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty y_n^*\\otimes x_n$, then $(Vu)(T)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty y_n^*(Tx_n)$. \n\nIt is easy to see that $\\|Vu\\|\\le \\|u\\|_\\pi$. The $\\lambda$-bounded approximation property of $X$ is equivalent to the fact that\n$\\|u\\|_\\pi\\le\\lambda\\|Vu\\|$ for all Banach spaces $Y$. This well-known result (see, e.g., \\cite[page 193]{DF}) is essentially due to Grothendieck \\cite{G}.\n\nOur result concerning spaces $G_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$ reads  as follows.\n\\begin{Th}\\label{te1.3}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Spaces $G_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$ have the $\\lambda$-approximation property with  \\penalty-10000 $\\displaystyle \\lambda=\\lambda(k,n,\\omega):=1+C\\cdot\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}\\,\\mbox{$\\frac{1}{\\omega(t)}$}$,\nwhere $C$ depends on $k$ and $n$ only.\n\\item All the other spaces $G_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$ have the $\\lambda$-approximation property with \\penalty-10000 $\\lambda= C'\\cdot\\lambda(1,n,\\omega)$, where $C'$ is a constant depending on $n$ only, if $k=0,1$, and with $\\lambda=\\frac{C''\\cdot \\lambda(k,n,\\omega)}{\\omega(1)}$, where $C''$ is a constant depending on $k$ and $n$ only, if $k\\ge 2$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{Th}\nIf $\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}\\omega(t)=\\infty$, then (1) implies that the corresponding space $G_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$ has the metric approximation property. In case $\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}\\omega(t)<\\infty$, one can define the new modulus of continuity $\\widetilde\\omega$ (cf. properties (i) and (ii) in its definition) by the formula\n\\[\n\\widetilde\\omega(t)=\\max\\{\\omega(t),t\\},\\quad t\\in (0,\\infty).\n\\]\nIt is easily seen  that spaces $C_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$ and $C_b^{k,\\widetilde\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$ are isomorphic. Thus $G_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$ is isomorphic to space $G_b^{k,\\widetilde\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$ having the metric approximation property. However, the distortion of this isomorphism depends  on $\\omega$. So, in general, it is not clear whether $G_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$ itself has the metric approximation property.\n\nIn fact, in some cases spaces $G_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$ still have the metric approximation property. E.g., by the classical result of Grothendieck \\cite[Ch.\\,I]{G},\nseparable dual spaces with the approximation property have the metric approximation property.\nThe class of such spaces $G_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$ is studied in the next section.\n\\begin{R}\\label{k}\n{\\rm It is not known, even for the case $k=0$, whether all spaces $C_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$ have the approximation property (for some results in this direction for $k=0$ see, e.g., \\cite{K}).\n}\n\\end{R}\nAt the end of this section we formulate a result describing the structure of operators in ${\\mathcal L}(G_b^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n);X)$, where $X$ is a separable Banach space with the $\\lambda$-approximation property.

Moreover, $\\widetilde H|_S=H$. This implies that $H\\in C_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$ and has norm $\\le \\|h\\|_{(G_b^{k,\\omega}(S))^*}$. Hence, the correspondence $h\\mapsto H$ determines a bounded nonincreasing norm linear injection $I_S:\\bigl(G_b^{k,\\omega}(S)\\bigr)^*\\rightarrow C_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$.\nLet us show that $I_S$ is a surjective isometry.

So let us check the last statement.\n\nLet $f\\in C_0^{k,\\omega}(S)$ be the restriction of a $C^\\infty$ function with compact support on ${\\mbf R}^n$. Since $H|_{S'}:S'\\rightarrow S$ is a proper map (by hypothesis (b) of the theorem),  $(H|_{S'})^*f\\in C_b^{k,\\omega}(S')$ has compact support.  Moreover, since $f\\in C_b^{k,\\omega_o}(S)$,  Lemma \\ref{lem6.3} applied to $\\widetilde\\omega=\\omega_o$ implies that $(H|_{S'})^*f\\in C_b^{k,\\omega_o}(S')$.

Due to condition \\eqref{equ1.8} for $\\omega_o$ we obtain from here that $Ef\\in C_0^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$. Since the set of such functions $f$ is dense in $C_0^{k,\\omega}(S)$ (see Corollary \\ref{cor1.10}), $E$ maps $C_0^{k,\\omega}(S)$ in $C_0^{k,\\omega}({\\mbf R}^n)$, as required.\n\\end{proof}\n\nNow the result of the theorem follows from Lemma \\ref{lem6.4} and Theorem \\ref{te1.4}\\,(2); that is,\n$G_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$ is isomorphic to $\\bigl(C_0^{k,\\omega}(S)\\bigr)^*$ and so $G_b^{k,\\omega}(S)$ and $C_0^{k,\\omega}(S)$\nhave the metric approximation property (see the argument at the end of section~6.1 above).\n\nThe proof of the theorem is complete. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n", "meta": {"timestamp": "2016-07-19T02:06:15", "yymm": "1607", "arxiv_id": "1607.04824", "language": "en", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04824"}}
{"text": "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction} \nIn  recent years  there  has  been a  resurgence  of  interest in  the\nproperties  of metastable  states, due  mostly to  the studies  of the\njammed   states   of   hard    sphere   systems;   see for   reviews  \nRefs. \\onlinecite{charbonneau16,  baule16}. There  are many  topics to\nstudy,  including  for example  the  spectrum  of small  perturbations\naround  the metastable  state,  i.e. the  phonon  excitations and  the\nexistence of  a boson peak,  and whether the Edwards  hypothesis works\nfor these states. In this paper we shall study some of these topics in\nthe context of classical Heisenberg  spin glasses both in the presence \nand absence of a random magnetic\nfield. Here the metastable states which we study  are just the minima of the Hamiltonian, and so are well-defined outside the mean-field limit. It  has  been  known  for some  time  that  there  are  strong\nconnections    between   spin    glasses   and    structural   glasses\n~\\cite{tarzia2007glass,fullerton2013growing,  moore06}.  It  has  been\nargued in very recent work~\\cite{baity2015soft}  that the study of the\nexcitations  in classical Heisenberg  spin glasses  provides the  opportunity to\ncontrast     with      similar     phenomenology      in     amorphous\nsolids~\\cite{wyart2005geometric,   charbonneau15}. The minima and excitations about the minima    in\nHeisenberg spin glasses have been studied for many years \\cite{bm1981,\n  yeo04, bm1982} but only in the absence of external fields. \n  \n   \n\n In  Sec.  \\ref{sec:models}  we define  the models  to be  studied as\n special  cases of  the  long-range one - dimensional $m$-component vector  spin\n glass  where the  exchange  interactions $J_{ij}$  decrease with  the\n distance   between   the   spins   at    sites   $i$   and   $j$   as\n $1/r_{ij}^{\\sigma}$. The spin $\\mathbf{S}_i$ is an $m$-component unit vector. $m=1$ corresponds to the Ising model, $m=2$ corresponds to the XY model and $m=3$ corresponds to the Heisenberg model. By  tuning the parameter $\\sigma$,  one can have\n access to  the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK)  model and on  dilution to\n the  Viana-Bray (VB)  model, and  indeed to  a range  of universality\n classes     from     mean-field-type      to     short-range     type\n \\cite{leuzzi2008dilute},  although in  this  paper  only two  special\n cases are studied;  the SK model and the Viana-Bray  model. We intend\n to study the cases which correspond to short-range models in a future\n publication.\n\nIn Sec. \\ref{sec:metastability} we have used numerical  methods to learn about\nthe metastable minima of the SK model and the Viana Bray model.  Our main procedure for finding the minima is\nto start from  a random configuration of\nspins  and then align each  spin  with the  local field\nproduced by its neighbors and the external random field, if present. The process is\ncontinued until  all spins are  aligned with their local  fields. This\nprocedure finds local minima of  the Hamiltonian. In the thermodynamic\nlimit, the  energy per spin $\\varepsilon$ of these states reaches  a characteristic\nvalue, which is  the same for  almost all realization  of the bonds and random external fields, but slightly dependent  on the dynamical algorithm used  for selecting the spin  to be\nflipped e.g. the ``polite''  or ``greedy''  or Glauber dynamics or the sequential algorithm used in the numerical work in this paper\n\\cite{newman:99,parisi:95}. \n   In the\ncontext of  Ising spin glasses in zero random fields  such states  were first \nstudied by  Parisi  \\cite{parisi:95}.   For Ising spins these\ndynamically  generated states  are an  unrepresentative subset  of the\ntotality  of the  one-spin  flip stable  metastable  states, which  in\ngeneral have  a distribution  of local fields  $p(h)$ with $p(0)$ is\nfinite  \\cite{roberts:81},  whereas  those generated  dynamically  are\nmarginally stable and  have $p(h) \\sim h$, just like  that in the true\nground state  \\cite{yan:15}. Furthermore  these states have  a trivial\noverlap with  each other: $P(q)= \\delta(q)$ \\cite{parisi:95};  there is\nno  sign of  replica  symmetry breaking  amongst  them. Presumably  to\ngenerate  states which  show  this  feature one  needs  to start  from\ninitial spin configurations drawn from  a realization of the system at\na temperature where broken replica  symmetry is already present before\nthe quench.\n\n Because the initial state is random, one would also expect for vector\n spin glasses that  the states reached after the  quench from infinite\n temperature  would  have  only  a trivial  overlap  with  each  other\n \\cite{newman:99}  and  this  is  indeed  found  to  be  the  case  in\n Sec. \\ref{sec:overlap}.  We have studied  the energy which is reached\n in the quench for both the $m=2$ and $m=3$ SK models but for the case\n of zero applied  random field and in  both cases it is  very close to\n the  energy $E_c$  which marks  the boundary  above which  the minima\n where spins are parallel to  their local fields have trivial overlaps\n with each  other, while below it  the minima have overlaps  with full\n broken   replica  symmetry   features   \\cite{bm:81a,  bm1981}.    In\n Ref. \\onlinecite{bm1981}  the number $N_S(\\varepsilon)$ of  minima of\n energy $\\varepsilon$ was calculated for  the case of zero random field\n in the SK model and in fact it  is only for this model and zero field\n that   the  value   of  $E_c$   is   available.   That   is  why   in\n Sec. \\ref{sec:marginal}  only this case was  studied numerically. The\n work in Sec. \\ref{sec:SKanalytic} was the start of an attempt to have\n the same information in the presence of random vector fields.\n\n The number of minima $N_S(\\varepsilon)$  is exponentially large so it\n is useful  to study  the complexity  defined as  $g(\\varepsilon)= \\ln\n N_S(\\varepsilon)/N$,  where  $N$  is  the  number  of  spins  in  the\n system. Despite  the fact  that minima  exist over  a large  range of\n values of $\\varepsilon$  a quench by a particular  algorithm seems to\n reach  just  the   minima  which  have  a   characteristic  value  of\n $\\varepsilon$. What is striking is that this characteristic value is close\n to  the energy  $E_c$ at  which  the minima  would no  longer have  a\n trivial overlap  with each other  but would start to  acquire replica\n symmetry  breaking features,  at least  for  the $m=2$  and $m=3$  SK\n models in zero field.  The states reached in the quenches are usually\n described   as   being   marginally  stable   \\cite{muller:15}.   The\n coincidence of the energy obtained in the numerical quenches with the\n analytically calculated  $E_c$ suggests that  long-range correlations\n normally associated with  a continuous transition will  also be found\n for  the quenched  minima  since  such features  are  present in  the\n analytical work at $E_c$ \\cite{bm:81a}.   In the Ising case the field\n distribution $p(h)$  produced in  the quench  is very  different from\n that assumed when determining $E_c$, and the quenched state energy at\n $\\approx -0.73$ was so far below from the Ising value of $E_c=-0.672$\n that the connection of its marginality to the onset of broken replica\n symmetry has been  overlooked. We believe that  the identification of\n the energy  $E_c$ reached  in the  quench with  the onset  of replica\n symmetry breaking in the overlaps of the minima is the most important\n of our results.\n\n  In Sec.  \\ref{sec:SKanalytic} we present  our analytical work on the\n  $m$-component SK  model in the  presence of an  $m$-component random\n  field.    It  has   been  shown   that  in   the  mean-field   limit\n  ~\\cite{sharma2010almeida} that  under the  application of  a random\n  magnetic field,  of variance  $h_r^2$, there  is a  phase transition\n  line in the $h_r - T$  plane, the so-called de Almeida-Thouless (AT)\n  line,  across which  the  critical  exponents lie  in  the Ising  AT\n  universality class.   Below this  line, the  ordered phase  has full\n  replica symmetry  breaking.  This  ordered phase  is similar  to the\n  Gardner  phase  expected  in high-dimensional  hard  sphere  systems\n  \\cite{charbonneau16}.  In  Sec.  \\ref{sec:SKanalytic} we  study  the\n  minima of  the Heisenberg  Hamiltonian in the  presence of  a random\n  vector field.  In the presence  of such  a field the  Hamiltonian no\n  longer has any  rotational invariances so one might  expect there to\n  be big changes in the excitations about the minimum as there will be\n  no Goldstone modes in the system.\n\n  We start Sec.  \\ref{sec:SKanalytic} by studying the  number of local\n  minima $N_S(\\varepsilon)$  of the Hamiltonian which  have energy per\n  spin  of   $\\varepsilon$.   The  calculation  within   the  annealed\n  approximation, where one  calculates the field and  bond averages of\n  $N_S(\\varepsilon)$ is  just an extension of  the earlier calculation\n  of Bray  and Moore  for zero random  field \\cite{bm1981}.   When the\n  random field $h_r> h_{AT}$, where $h_{AT}$ is the field at which the\n  AT transition  occurs, the complexity is  zero, but $g(\\varepsilon)$\n  becomes non-zero  for $h_r <  h_{AT}$.  When  it is non-zero,  it is\n  thought  better to  average the  complexity itself  over the  random\n  fields and bonds  so that one recovers results likely  to apply to a\n  typical  sample.  We  have   attempted  to  calculate  the  quenched\n  complexity $g$ for  the SK model in the presence  of a random field.\n  The presence  of this random  field greatly complicates  the algebra\n  and  the calculations  in Sec.  \\ref{sec:quenched} and  the Appendix\n  really just  illustrate the  problems that  random fields  pose when\n  determining the quenched average but do not overcome the algebraic\n  difficulties.\n \n  The annealed approximation  is much simpler \n and using it we have calculated the density of states $\\rho(\\lambda)$\n of  the Hessian  matrix associated  with the  minimum for the SK model. \n   When  $h_r  >  h_{AT}$  there is  a  gap\n $\\lambda_0$ in  the spectrum  below which  there are  no excitations.\n $\\lambda_0$  tends to  zero  as $h_r  \\to h_{AT}$.   For  $m \\ge  4$,\n $\\rho(\\lambda)   \\sim  \\sqrt{\\lambda-\\lambda_0}$   as  $\\lambda   \\to\n \\lambda_0$. For  $m =3$  the square root  singularity did  not occur,\n much to our  surprise. For $h_r < h_{AT}$,  the square-root singularity\n applies for  all $m >  2$ with  $\\lambda_0=0$. Thus in  the low-field\n phase, despite  the fact that  in the  presence of the  random fields\n there  are  no continuous  symmetries  in  the  system and  hence  no\n Goldstone   modes,    there   are   massless   modes    present.   In\n Sec.  \\ref{sec:density} we  present numerical  work which  shows that\n even for $h_r < h_{AT}$ when the annealed calculation of the density of\n states  of the  SK  model  cannot be  exact,  it  nevertheless is  in\n good agreement with our numerical data.\n\n We   have   also  calculated in Sec. \\ref{sec:spinglasssusceptibility}  the   zero   temperature  spin   glass\n susceptibility $\\chi_{SG}$  for $h_r >  h_{AT}$ for the SK  model and\n find that for all $m > 2$ it diverges to infinity as $h_r \\to h_{AT}$\n just as is  found at finite  temperatures \\cite{sharma2010almeida}.\n\nFor the SK  model, because the complexity is zero  for $h_r > h_{AT}$,\nthe  quench  produces states  sensitive  to  the  existence of  an  AT\nfield. The quench then goes to a state which is the ground state or at\nleast  one very  like  it. The  AT  field  is a  feature  of the  true\nequilibrium state  of the system,  which in our  case is the  state of\nlowest  energy.  In  Sec.  \\ref{sec:spinglasssusceptibility}  we  have\nstudied  a  ``spin glass  susceptibility''  obtained  from the  minima\nobtained in our numerical quenches and  only for the SK model is there\nevidence for a diverging spin  glass susceptibility. For the VB model,\nthere is no  sign of any singularity in the  spin glass susceptibility\ndefined  as an  average over  the states  reached in  our quench  from\ninfinite temperature, but we cannot  make any statement concerning the\nexistence of an  AT singularity in the true ground  state. This is the\nproblem studied in Ref. \\onlinecite{lupo:16}.\n\n       Finally       in\nSec.  \\ref{sec:conclusions}  we summarise our main results and make some suggestions for further research.\n\n \n\n\\section{Models}\n\\label{sec:models}\nThe Hamiltonians  studied in this paper are generically of the form\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{H} = -m\\sum_{\\langle i, j \\rangle} J_{ij} \\mathbf{S}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_j - \\sqrt{m}\\sum_i \\mathbf{h}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_i \\, ,\n\\label{Ham}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the $\\mathbf{S}_i$, $i = 1, 2, \\cdots, N$,\nare classical $m$-component vector spins of unit length. This form of writing the Hamiltonian allows for easy comparison against a Hamiltonian where the spins are normalized to have length $\\sqrt{m}$. We are particularly interested in Heisenberg spins, for which $m=3$. \nThe magnetic fields $h_i^\\mu$, where $\\mu$ denotes a Cartesian spin component,\nare chosen to be\nindependent Gaussian random fields, uncorrelated between\nsites, with zero mean, which satisfy\n\\begin{equation}\n[ h_i^\\mu h_j^\\nu]_{av} = h_r^2\\, \\delta_{ij}\\, \\delta_{\\mu\\nu} \\, .\n\\label{hs}\n\\end{equation}\nThe notation $[\\cdots]_{av}$ indicates an average over the quenched disorder and the magnetic fields.\n\nWe shall study two models, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model and the Viana-Bray  (VB) model. Both are essentially mean-field models. In the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, the bonds $J_{ij}$ couple all pairs of sites and are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and the variance $1/(N-1)$. \n\nThe Viana-Bray model can be regarded as a special case of a diluted one-dimensional model where the sites are arranged around a ring.\nThe procedure to determine the bonds $J_{ij}$ to get the diluted model is as specified in Refs.  \\onlinecite{leuzzi2008dilute,sharma2011phase,sharma2011almeida}.\nThe probability of there being a non-zero interaction between sites $(i,j)$ on the ring falls off with distance as a power-law, and when an\ninteraction does occur, its variance is independent of $r_{ij}$. The mean number of non-zero bonds from a site is fixed to be $z$. \nTo generate the set of pairs $(i,j)$ that have an interaction with the desired probability\nthe spin $i$ is chosen randomly, and then $j \\ (\\ne i)$ is chosen at distance $r_{ij}$ with probability \n\\begin{equation}\np_{ij} = \\frac{r_{ij}^{-2\\sigma}}{\\sum_{j\\, (j\\neq i)}r_{ij}^{-2\\sigma}} \\, ,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $r_{ij}=\\frac{N}{\\pi}\\sin\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{N}(i-j)\\right]$ is the\nlength of the chord between the sites $i,j$ when all the sites are\nput on a circle.  If $i$ and $j$ are already connected, the process is\nrepeated until a pair which has not been connected before is\nfound. The sites $i$ and $j$ are then connected with an interaction\npicked from a Gaussian interaction whose mean is zero and whose\nstandard deviation is set to $J \\equiv 1$.  This process is repeated\nprecisely $N_b = z N / 2 $ times. This procedure automatically gives\n$J_{ii} = 0$. Our work concentrates on the case where the coordination number is fixed at $z=6$ to mimic the $3$-d cubic scenario.\nThe SK limit ($z=N-1, \\sigma = 0$) is a special case of this model, as is the VB model which also has  $\\sigma = 0$,  but\nthe coordination number $z$  has (in this paper)  the value  $6$. The advantage of the one-dimensional long-range  model for numerical studies is that by simply tuning the value of $\\sigma$ one can mimic the properties of finite dimensional systems~\\cite{leuzzi2008dilute,sharma2011phase,sharma2011almeida} and we have already done some work using this device. However, in this paper we only report on our work on the SK and VB models.\n\n\n\\section{Numerical studies of the minima obtained by quenching}\n\\label{sec:metastability} \n\nIn this section we present our  numerical studies of the minima of the\nVB  and SK  models. We  begin by  describing how  we found  the minima\nnumerically.   They  are   basically  just   quenches  from   infinite\ntemperature. In  Sec.  \\ref{sec:overlap}  we have studied  the overlap\nbetween the  minima and  we find  that the  minima produced  have only\ntrivial  overlaps  with  one  another. In  Sec  \\ref{sec:marginal}  we\ndescribe our  evidence that the minima  of the SK model  in zero field\nhave marginal stability  as they have an energy per  spin close to the\nenergy $E_c$  which marks the energy  at which the minima  starting to\nhave overlaps showing replica symmetry breaking features.\n\nAt zero temperature, the metastable states (minima) which we study are those obtained by aligning every spin along its  local field direction, starting  off from a random initial state. In the notation used for our numerical work based on Eq. (\\ref{Ham}) we iterate the equations\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbf{S}^{n+1}_i= \\frac{\\mathbf{H}^{n}_i}{|\\mathbf{H}_i^{n}|},\n\\label{eq:parn}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the local fields after the $n$th iteration, $\\mathbf{H}_i^{n}$, are given by\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbf{H}_i^n= \\sqrt{m} \\mathbf{h}_i+m \\sum_j J_{ij} \\mathbf{S}_j^{n}.\n\\label{eq:hdefn}\n\\end{equation}\n For a given disorder\nsample, a random configuration of spins is first created which would be a possible spin configuration at infinite temperature. Starting from the\nfirst spin and scanning sequentially all the way up to the $N^{th}$\nspin, every spin is aligned to its local field according to\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:parn}), this whole process constituting one\nsweep. The vector $(\\Delta \\mathbf{S}_{1},\\Delta \\mathbf{S}_{2},\\cdots,\\Delta \\mathbf{S}_{N})$ is computed by subtracting the\nspin configuration before the sweep from the spin configuration\ngenerated after the sweep. The quantity $\\eta = \\frac{1}{Nm}\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{m}\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{N}(\\Delta S_{j\\mu})^{2}}$ is a measure of how close the configurations before and\nafter the sweep are. The spin configurations are iterated over many sweeps until the value of $\\eta$ falls below $0.00001$, when the system is deemed to have converged to the metastable state described by Eq.~(\\ref{eq:par}), which will be a minimum of the energy at zero temperature. Differing starting configurations usually generate different minima, at least for large systems.\n\n\\subsection{Overlap distribution}\n\\label{sec:overlap}\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig_VB.eps} \n  \\caption{(Color online) The overlap distribution $P(q)$ for the VB model ($\\sigma =0, z =6$, $h_r=0.6$) for the minima generated by the prescription described in the text. $P(q)$ seems to be approaching a delta function as $N$ tends to infinity.}\n  \\label{fig0}\n\\end{figure}\nIt is informative to study the overlaps between the various minima.\nConsider the overlap between two minima $A$ and $B$ defined as\n\\begin{equation}\nq \\equiv \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{S}_i^{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_i^{B}.\n\\end{equation}\nNumerically, the following procedure is adopted. A particular realization of the bonds and fields is chosen. Choosing a random initial spin configuration, the above algorithm is implemented and descends to a locally stable state. This generates a metastable spin state that is stored. One then chooses a second initial condition, and the algorithm is applied, which generates a second metastable spin state which is also stored. One repeats this $N_{min}$ times generating in total $N_{min}$ metastable states (some or all of which might be identical). One then overlaps all pairs of these states, so there are $N_{pairs} = N_{min}(N_{min}-1)/2$ overlaps which are all used to make a histogram. The whole process is averaged over $N_{samp}$ samples of disorder. Fig.~\\ref{fig0} shows the overlap distribution of the metastable states obtained by the above prescription for the VB model.  The figure suggests that in the thermodynamic limit, the distribution of overlaps, $P(q) = \\delta(q-q_0(h_r))$. In zero field we have \nfound that $q_0(h_r=0)=0$. Since we study  only a finite system of $N$ spins, the delta function peak is broadened to a Gaussian centered around $q_0$ and of width $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$. We studied also the SK model, for a range of values for the $h_r$ fields, and the data are consistent with $P(q)$ just having a single peak in the thermodynamic limit. This suggests that the metastable states generated by the procedure of repeatedly putting spins parallel  to their local fields starting from a random state always produces minima which have a  $P(q)$ of the same type as would be expected for the paramagnetic phase.\n\n Newman and Stein \\cite{newman:99} showed that for Ising spins in zero field that when one starts off from an initial state, equivalent to being at infinite temperature, and quenches to zero temperature one always ends up in a state with a trivial $P(q)=\\delta(q)$, in agreement, for example with the study of Parisi \\cite{parisi:95}. Our results for vector spin glasses seem exactly analogous to the Ising results.\n \n\\subsection{Marginal stability}\n\\label{sec:marginal}\nIn  this subsection  we  shall focus  on  the  Ising, XY  ($m  = 2$)  and\nHeisenberg ($m=3$) SK models with zero random field.  Parisi found for\nthe Ising case that when  starting a quench from infinite temperature,\nwhen  the spins  are  just  randomly up  or  down,  and putting  spins\nparallel to  their local fields  according to various  algorithms, the\nfinal   state    had   an   energy   per    spin   $\\varepsilon=-0.73$\n\\cite{parisi:95}.  In  their  studies  of one-spin  flip  stable  spin\nglasses in zero field, Bray  and Moore  \\cite{bm1981,bm:81a} found that  such states\nassociated with  a trivial $P(q)=\\delta(q)$  should not exist  below a\ncritical energy $E_c$ and for the Ising case $E_c=-0.672$. States with\nan  energy close  to $-0.73$  would be  expected to  be have  a $P(q)$\nrather similar to those for  full replica symmetry breaking, but those\ngenerated in the quench have a  trivial $P(q)$. There is no paradox as\nthe  states generated  in  the  quench have  more  than one-spin  flip\nstability  \\cite{yan:15}.  This  results  in a  distribution of  local\nfields behaving  at small  fields so that $p(h)  \\sim h$,  very different\nfrom  that expected  from the  study of  the $p(h)$  of one-spin  flip\nstable  states  \\cite{roberts:81}  for  which $p(0)$  is  finite,  and\ninstead similar to what is found in the true ground state -- the state\nwhich is stable  against flipping an arbitrary number of  spins. It is\nby that  means that the  theorem of Newman and  Stein \\cite{newman:99}\nthat in a  quench from a random initial state  the final $P(q)$ should\nbe  trivial is  realized, despite  the  quenched energy  being in  the\nregion  where one  would expect  the $P(q)$  of one  spin flip  stable\nstates to be non-trivial. The change  in the form of $p(h)$ means that\nthe true $E_c$ is  not at $-0.672$, but instead is  at least closer to\n$-0.73$.\n\nFor the vector SK spin glasses in zero field we have studied the\nenergy reached in a quench from infinite temperature by putting the\nspins parallel to their local fields.  In Figs.  \\ref{fig:SKXYEc} and\n\\ref{fig:SKHeisEc} we have plotted our estimates of this energy as a\nfunction of $1/N^{2/3}$, the form commonly used for the energy size\ndependence of the SK model \\cite{boettcher:03, billoire:08}.  For\n$m=2$, the extrapolated energy per spin component is $\\approx -0.870$,\nwhereas its $E_c=-0.866$ according to the analysis in\nRef. \\onlinecite{bm1981}; for $m=3$ the extrapolated energy per spin\ncomponent is $\\approx -0.915$ whereas its $E_c =-0.914$ \\cite{bm1981}.\nMinima whose energies lie below the critical energy $E_c$, are\nassociated with non-trivial (i.e.  RSB) form for their $P(q)$,\ncalculated from the overlaps of the minima at the same energy\n\\cite{bm1981, bm:81a}.  We found just as for the Ising SK model that\nthe energy reached in the quench varied little when the greedy\nalgorithm was used instead of the sequential algorithm\n\\cite{parisi:95}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig_XY_SK_energy.eps} \n  \\caption{(Color online) The average  energy per site and spin component for the XY SK spin glass model ($m =2$) with $h_r=0$ plotted against $1/N^{2/3}$ in order to estimate the infinite system value of the energy obtained from a quench from infinite temperature.

For $m =3$, $E_c=-0.914$ \\cite{bm1981}. }\n  \\label{fig:SKHeisEc}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs  the energy  of  the  quenched state  is  remarkably  close to  the\ncritical energies  calculated by  Bray and  Moore \\cite{bm1981,bm:81a}\nfor  $m=2$ and  $m=3$, this  suggests that  the state  reached in  the\nquench     is     well-described     by    the     calculations     in\nRef. \\onlinecite{bm1981},  whereas for  the Ising case  the equivalent\ncalculation which enumerates the number of one-spin flip stable states\ndoes not  give the resulting $p(h)$  of the quenched states  with much\naccuracy and so does not produce an accurate estimate of $E_c$.\n\nOne knows a  lot about behavior at  $E_c$ at least for  Ising spins in\nzero  random  field  \\cite{bm:81a}.  For states  of  energy  per  spin\n$\\varepsilon >  E_c$, the  annealed and  quenched averages  agree with\neach other, but for energies $\\varepsilon < E_c$, the two calculations\ndiffer.  As  $\\varepsilon$  approaches  $E_c$, behavior  is  as  at  a\ncritical point,  with growing  length scales  etc. and  massless modes\n\\cite{bm:81a}. For the  Ising case the properties of  these modes were\ndiscussed in  Ref. \\onlinecite{bm:81a}.  We intend  to return  to this\ntopic in a future publication for the case of vector spin glasses.\n\n When one sets an Ising spin parallel to its local field in the course\n of the  quench, spin avalanches  may be  triggered. If the  number of\n neighbors $z$ is of order $N$ then  the avalanches can be on all size\n scales \\cite{boettcher:08, andresen:13}.  Thus  the Ising SK model is\n an  example of  a  system  with marginal  stability  as discussed  by\n M\\\"{u}ller   and   Wyart   \\cite{muller:15}.   It   was   argued   in\n Ref. \\onlinecite{muller:15} that as  the quench progresses the system\n will reach the marginal manifold which separates stable from unstable\n configurations. As  this point is  approached the dynamics  slows and\n eventually freezes near the marginal  manifold.  The VB model with $z\n =6$ does not have large  scale avalanches \\cite{andresen:13} and does\n not have any marginal features; a first study of avalanches in the undiluted\n one-dimensional long-range  models can be found in \\cite{boettcher:08}.   While the  Ising VB model  does not have  large scale\n avalanches, there certainly  will be an energy $E_c$  below which the\n minima will have  non-trivial overlaps. What is not  clear is whether\n it is the large  avalanches which ensures that the states  generated in a\n quench are close to this energy.\n \nWe  also  do not  know  what  difference  the  existence of  a  finite\ntemperature  phase  might  make  to the  properties  of  the  quenched\nstate. For example,  are there features of the quenched  states of one\nand  two dimensional  Ising spin  glasses,  where there  is no  finite\ntemperature  spin glass  transition, which  differ significantly  from\nthose of  the three dimensional  spin glass,  where there is  a finite\ntemperature phase transition? We also  do not know what features might\narise if  there is  a phase  transition to a  state with  full replica\nsymmetry breaking, as opposed to a state with just replica symmetry.\n\nFor systems  for which the  excitations are  not discrete, such  as in\nvector spin  glasses, marginality  takes a  different form,  and seems\nrelated  to the  development of  negative eigenvalues  in the  Hessian\n\\cite{muller:15,sharma2014avalanches}.  Such  eigenvalue instabilities\nmight be triggered in a quench  where one puts spins parallel to their\nlocal fields. On the other hand,  one could imagine a steepest descent\nprocedure  starting from  the  initial spin  orientation and  smoothly\nproceeding  to a  minimum. Does  that result  in a  final state  whose\nproperties differ  from those generated  by putting spins  parallel to\ntheir local fields? \n\nThere are many topics which should be studied! We believe that the proximity of the quenched energy to the calculated critical energy $E_c$, at least for the cases of $m =2$ and $m =3$  will provide valuable analytical insights concerning marginal stability. One of our motivations for the analytic work in the next section was to calculate $E_c(h_r)$ in the presence of a non-zero random vector field, but, as we shall see, algebraic difficulties prevented us from achieving this goal. But it would be good to know how general is the result that the energy obtained in a quench coincides with the energy at which the overlaps of the minima display replica symmetry breaking features. \n\n\\section{Metastable states in the SK model in the presence of a random field}\n\\label{sec:SKanalytic}\n\nIn this section we follow the method of Ref. \\onlinecite{bm1981}\n to study the complexity and Hessian properties of the minima for the SK model but in the presence of a random vector field. We begin by writing down the first steps in the formalism following Ref. \\onlinecite{bm1981}. In\n subsection \\ref{SKannealed} we show that within the annealed approximation, where one averages $N_S(\\varepsilon)$ itself over the bonds $J_{ij}$ and the random fields $h_i^{ex}$ analytical progress is fairly straightforward. Fortunately the annealed approximation is also exact for fields $h_r > h_{AT}$. In subsection \\ref{sec:quenched} we describe our attempts to solve the quenched case. We believe that our approach based on  replica symmetry assumptions should be good down to its limit of stability which would be at $E_c(h_r)$, but  algebraic difficulties prevented us from actually determining $E_c(h_r)$.\n\n We  find it convenient to write the Hamiltonian for the $m$-vector spin glass in an $m$-component external field  as\n\\begin{equation}\n \\mathcal{H}=-\\frac{m}{2}\\sum_{i,j} J_{ij}\\bm{S}_i\\cdot\\bm{S}_j-m\\sum_i\\bm{h}^{\\rm ex}_i\\cdot\\bm{S}_i,\n \\label{Hamil}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the $m$-component spins $\\bm{S}_i=\\{S^\\alpha_i\\}$, ($\\alpha=1,\\cdots,m$, $i=1,\\cdots,N$) have a unit length\n$S_i=1$. The interactions $J_{ij}$ are chosen from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and the variance $1/N$. \nIn this section, for convenience, we use the notation $\\bm{h}^{\\rm ex}_i=\\bm{h}_i/\\sqrt{m}$ for\nthe random Gaussian external fields with zero mean and the variance  \n\\begin{equation}\n \\langle h^{{\\rm ex},\\alpha}_i h^{{\\rm ex},\\beta}_j\\rangle =\\frac{h^2_r}{m}\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{\\alpha\\beta}.\n\\end{equation}\n\nAt zero temperature, the spins are aligned in the direction of the local internal field $\\bm{H}_i$, i.e.\n\\begin{equation}\n \\bm{S}_i=\\hat{\\bm{H}}_i\\equiv\\frac{\\bm{H}_i}{H_i},\n\\label{eq:par}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere\n\\begin{equation}\n \\bm{H}_i=\\sum_j J_{ij}\\bm{S}_j +\\bm{h}^{\\rm ex}_i.\n\\label{eq:hdef}\n\\end{equation}\nIn terms of the local fields, the ground state energy $E$ can be written as\n\\begin{equation}\n E=-\\frac{m}{2}\\sum_i(H_i+\\hat{\\bm{H}}_i\\cdot \\bm{h}^{\\rm ex}_i). \n\\end{equation}\n\nThe number of metastable states with energy $\\varepsilon$ per site and per spin component is given by\n\\begin{align}\n &N_S(\\varepsilon)=\\int\\prod_{i,\\alpha}dH_i^{\\alpha}\\int\\prod_{i,\\alpha}dS_i^{\\alpha} \n\\prod_{i,\\alpha}\\delta(S_i^{\\alpha}-\\hat{H}_i^{\\alpha}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&~~~~~~\\times \\prod_{i,\\alpha}\\delta\\left(H_i^{\\alpha}-\\sum_j J_{ij}S_j^{\\alpha}-h^{{\\rm ex},\\alpha}_{i}\\right)\n|\\det\\mathsf{M}\\{J_{ij}\\}|\n \\nonumber \\\\\n &~~~~~~\\times\n \\delta\\left(Nm\\varepsilon+\\frac 1 2 m \\sum_i (H_i + \\hat{\\bm{H}}_i\\cdot\\bm{h}^{\\rm ex}_i ) \\right),\n \\label{NS}\n\\end{align}\nwhere \n\\begin{equation}\n M^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial S^\\beta_j}(S^\\alpha_i-\\hat{H}^\\alpha_i)\n =\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{\\alpha\\beta}-J_{ij}\\frac{P^{\\alpha\\beta}_i}{H_i}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $P^{\\alpha\\beta}_i\\equiv \\delta^{\\alpha\\beta}-\\hat{H}^\\alpha_i\\hat{H}^\\beta_i$\nis the projection matrix.\n\n\\subsection{Annealed Approximation}\n\\label{SKannealed}\nWe now calculate the average of $N_S(\\varepsilon)$ over the random couplings and the random external fields. As we will \nsee below, the direct evaluation of the quenched average $\\langle \\ln N_S(\\varepsilon) \\rangle$ is very complicated. \nHere we first present the annealed approximation, where we evaluate the annealed complexity $g_A(\\varepsilon)=\\ln \\langle N_S(\\varepsilon) \\rangle/N$.\nThe whole calculation is very similar to those in Appendix 2 of Ref.~\\onlinecite{bm1981} except for \nthe part involving the average over the random field. Below we sketch the calculation.\n\nThe first delta functions in Eq.~(\\ref{NS}) can be integrated away. We use the integral\nrepresentations for the second and third delta functions using the variables $x_i^{\\alpha}$ and $u$, respectively,\nalong the imaginary axis. \nThe average over the random couplings can be done in an exactly the same way as in Ref.~\\onlinecite{bm1981}.\nWe briefly summarize the results below. The random couplings appear in the factor \n\\begin{align}\n& \\left\\langle \n \\exp\\Big[-\\sum_{i<j}J_{ij}\\sum_{i,\\alpha} (x^\\alpha_{i}\\hat{H}^\\alpha_{j}\n+x^\\alpha_{j}\\hat{H}^\\alpha_{i})\\Big]  |\\det\\mathsf{M} \\{J_{ij}\\}| \n \\right\\rangle_J \\nonumber \\\\\n=&\\exp \\Big[ \\frac 1 {2N} \\sum_{i<j}\\Big\\{ \\sum_{\\alpha}(x^\\alpha_{i}\\hat{H}^\\alpha_{j}\n+x^\\alpha_{j}\\hat{H}^\\alpha_{i}) \\Big\\}^2\\Big] \\nonumber \\\\ \n&~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\times \\left\\langle  |\\det\\mathsf{M} \\{J_{ij}-O(\\frac 1 N)\\}|  \\right\\rangle_J .\n \\end{align}\nAfter neglecting the $O(1/N)$ term, we evaluate the average of the determinant as \\cite{bm1981}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\left\\langle  |\\det\\mathsf{M} \\{J_{ij}\\}|  \n\\right\\rangle_J=\\exp(\\frac 1 2 Nm\\bar{\\chi})\\prod_i \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{\\chi}}{H_i}\\right)^{m-1},\n\\label{det}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the susceptibility $\\bar{\\chi}$ satisfies the self-consistency equation \\cite{bm1981}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\bar{\\chi}=(1-\\frac 1 m)\\frac 1 N \\sum_i \\frac 1 {H_i-\\bar{\\chi}}\n\\label{chi}\n\\end{equation}\nwith the condition $H_i\\ge\\bar{\\chi}$.\nUsing the rotational invariance and the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, \nwe can rewrite the exponential factor in front of the determinant\nas\n\\begin{align}\n &\\exp[\\frac 1{2m}\\sum_{i,\\alpha}(x^\\alpha_{i})^2 ]  \\\\\n&~\\times \\int\\frac{dv}{(2\\pi/Nm)^{1/2}}\\;\n \\exp [ -\\frac{Nm}{2} v^2+ v \n \\sum_{i,\\alpha}x^\\alpha_{i}\\hat{H}^\\alpha_{i} ]. \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\nIn the present case, we have to    \naverage over the random field. Collecting the relevant terms, we have\n\\begin{align}\n& \\left\\langle \n \\exp\\Big[-\\sum_{i,\\alpha} (x^\\alpha_{i}+\\frac 1 2 u m \\hat{H}^\\alpha_{i})h^{{\\rm ex},\\alpha}_{i}\\Big]\n \\right\\rangle_{\\bm{h}^{\\rm ex}}  \\\\\n=&\\exp\\Big[ \n\\frac{h^2_r}{2m}\\sum_{i,\\alpha}(x^\\alpha_{i})^2\n+\\frac{h^2_r}{2} u  \\sum_{i,\\alpha}x^\\alpha_{i}\\hat{H}^\\alpha_{i}\n+Nm\\frac{h^2_r }{8}u^2\n\\Big] .   \\nonumber  \n \\end{align}\n\nAll the site indices are now decoupled. We express the condition Eq.~(\\ref{chi})\nusing the integral representation of the delta function with the variable $\\lambda$\nrunning along the imaginary axis. \nPutting all the terms together, we have \n\\begin{align}\n &\\langle [N_S(\\varepsilon)] \\rangle_{J,h^{\\rm ex}}=\n \\int \\frac{du}{2\\pi i} \\int \\frac{dv}{\\sqrt{2\\pi/Nm}} \\int d\\bar{\\chi} \n \\int \\frac{d\\lambda}{2\\pi i}  \\nonumber  \\\\\n& \\times\n\\exp\\Big[\nNm \\lambda \\bar{\\chi} + \\frac{Nm}{2}  \\bar{\\chi}^2 \n-Nm\\varepsilon  u \n-\\frac{Nm}{2} v^2  \\nonumber \\\\\n&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+Nm\\frac{h^2_r}{8}u^2 +N\\ln I^\\prime \n\\Big],  \\label{NS_ann}\n \\end{align}\nwhere\n\\begin{align}\n I^\\prime=&\\int_{H\\ge\\bar{\\chi}}\\prod_{\\alpha}dH^\\alpha\n \\int\\prod_{\\alpha}\\frac{dx^\\alpha}{2\\pi i} \n \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{\\chi}}{H}\\right)^{m-1}  \\nonumber \\\\\n &\\times \\exp\\Bigg[\n \\frac{1+h^2_r}{2m}\\sum_{\\alpha}(x^\\alpha)^2\n+ (v+\\frac{h^2_r}{2}u)\\sum_\\alpha x^\\alpha\\hat{H}^\\alpha \n      \\nonumber \\\\\n & +\\sum_{\\alpha}x^\\alpha H^\\alpha -(m-1) \\lambda (H-\\bar{\\chi})^{-1}\n -\\frac{m}{2} u H \n \\Bigg]  \n  \\end{align}\nThe Gaussian integral over $x^\\alpha$ can be done analytically.  \nThe integrals in Eq.~(\\ref{NS_ann}) are evaluated via the saddle point method in the $N\\to\\infty$ limit.\nFollowing the procedure described in Ref.~\\onlinecite{bm1981},\nwe introduce new variables \n$\\bm{h}\\equiv (H-\\bar{\\chi})\\hat{\\bm{H}}$ and\n$\\Delta=-v-\\bar{\\chi}$ and use the saddle point condition for $\\bar{\\chi}$, which is\n\\begin{equation}\n\\lambda-\\Delta-\\frac u 2=0.\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe finally have an expression for the annealed complexity \n$g_A(\\varepsilon)\\equiv N^{-1}\\ln\\langle N_S(\\varepsilon)\\rangle$ as\n\\begin{equation}\n g_A(\\varepsilon) = m (-\\frac{\\Delta^2}{2} \n-\\varepsilon  u +\\frac{h^2_r}{8}u^2) +\\ln I, \n \\end{equation}\n where \n \\begin{align}\n &I= \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi(1+h^2_r)}\\right)^{m/2}S_m\\int^\\infty_0 dh\\; h^{m-1} \n   \\\\\n &\\times\\exp\\Big[ \n -\\frac{m}{2(1+h^2_r)}(h-\\Delta+\\frac{h^2_r}{2}u)^2 \\nonumber \\\\ \n&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -\\frac{(m-1)}{h}(\\Delta+\\frac u 2)\n -\\frac{m}{2}uh\\Big] \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\nwith the surface area of the $m$-dimensional unit sphere $S_m=2\\pi^{m/2}/\\Gamma(m/2)$.\nThe parameters $\\Delta$ and $u$ are determined variationally as \n$\\partial g_A/\\partial \\Delta =\\partial g_A/\\partial u =0$.\n\nWe focus on the total number of metastable states, which are obtained by integrating \n$\\exp(Ng_A(\\varepsilon))$ over $\\varepsilon$, or equivalently by setting $u=0$. Thus we are effectively focussing on the most numerous states, those at the top of the band where $g_A(\\varepsilon)$ is largest. \nIn this case, $g_A=-(m/2)\\Delta^2+\\ln I_0$, where\n\\begin{align}\n I_0 =& S_m \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi(1+h^2_r)}\\right)^{m/2}\\int_0^\\infty dh\\; h^{m-1} \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\times \\exp\\left[ -(m-1)\\frac{\\Delta}{h}-\\frac{m(h-\\Delta)^2}{2(1+h^2_r)}\\right]\n\\label{I0}.\n\\end{align}\nThe parameter $\\Delta$ is determined by the saddle point equation \n\\begin{equation}\n \\Delta=\\frac{1}{2+h^2_r}\\langle h \\rangle -\n \\left(1-\\frac{1}{m}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1+h^2_r}{2+h^2_r}\\right)\n \\left\\langle\\frac{1}{h}\\right\\rangle,\n \\label{Delta}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the average is calculated with respect to the probability distribution for the internal field given by\nthe integrand of \n$I_0$ in Eq.~(\\ref{I0}).\nUsing $\\langle h \\rangle =\\Delta + \\langle h-\\Delta \\rangle$, we can rewrite Eq.~(\\ref{I0}) as\n\\begin{equation}\n \\Delta \\left[ 1- \\left(1-\\frac 1 m \\right)\\left\\langle \\frac 1 {h^2} \\right\\rangle \\right]=0.\n\\label{Delta1}\n \\end{equation}\n\nFor various values of the external field $h_r$,\nwe solve numerically Eq.~(\\ref{Delta}). For $m=3$, we find that when $h_r>h_{AT}=1$\nthere is only a trivial solution, $\\Delta=0$. (Note that the Almeida-Thouless field $h_{AT}$ at $T=0$ is\n$h_{AT}=1/\\sqrt{m-2}$ ~\\cite{sharma2010almeida}). From Eq.~(\\ref{I0}), we see that in this case $I_0=1$ and the complexity $g$ vanishes above the AT field. \nFor $h_r<h_{AT}$, a nontrivial solution, $\\Delta\\neq 0$ exists. \nWe find that the values of $\\Delta$ and $g_A$ increase as the external field $h_r$ decreases\nfrom $h_{AT}$, and approach the known values, 0.170 and 0.00839 at zero external field \\cite{bm1981}.\nFor $h_r$ smaller than but very close to $h_{AT}$, $\\Delta$ is very small. \nWe may obtain an analytic expression for $g_A$ in this case. \nBy expanding everything in Eq.~(\\ref{Delta1}) in powers of $\\Delta$, we find for $m=3$ that \n\\begin{equation}\n g_A=\\frac 3 2 (h^2_{AT}-h^2_r)\\tilde{\\Delta}^2+8\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2\\pi}}\n \\tilde{\\Delta}^3\\ln\\tilde{\\Delta}+O(\\tilde{\\Delta}^3),\n \\label{gA0}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\tilde{\\Delta}=\\Delta/\\sqrt{1+h^2_r}$. The fact that $g_A$ must be stationary with respect to $\\tilde{\\Delta}$, enables one to determine how the complexity vanishes as $h_r \\to h_{AT}$ and the value of $\\tilde{\\Delta}$ in this limit.\n\nUsing the distribution for the internal field $H$ (or $h$), \nwe first calculate the spin glass susceptibility $\\chi_{SG}\\equiv (Nm)^{-1}\\mathrm{Tr} \\mathbf{\\chi}^2$ with the \nsusceptibility matrix $\\mathbf{\\chi}=\\chi_{ij}^{\\alpha\\beta}$ \\cite{bm1981}.  \nNote that the susceptibility in Eq.~(\\ref{chi}) is\njust $\\bar{\\chi}=(Nm)^{-1}\\mathrm{Tr}\\mathbf{\\chi}$. The spin glass susceptibility is given by \\cite{bm1981}\n$\\chi_{SG}=(1-\\lambda_R)/\\lambda_R$, where\n\\begin{equation}\n\\lambda_R=1-(1-\\frac 1 m)\\frac 1 N \\sum_i \\frac 1{(H_i-\\bar{\\chi})^2}.\n\\label{lambda_R}\n\\end{equation}\nThis quantity is exactly the one in the square bracket in Eq.~(\\ref{Delta1}). \nTherefore, since $\\Delta\\neq 0$ for $h_r<h_{AT}$,\n$\\lambda_R$ vanishes and consequently $\\chi_{SG}$ diverges. Above the AT field,\nthere is only a trivial solution $\\Delta=0$. In this case the integrals are just Gaussians and we can evaluate explicitly $\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\frac 1{(H_i-\\bar{\\chi})^2}$, with the result that $\\lambda_R=(h_r^2-1/(m-2))/(1+h_r^2)$, so \n the spin glass \nsusceptibility as a function of the external random field for $h_r>h_{AT}$ is given by\n\\begin{equation}\n\\chi_{SG}=\\frac{1+h_{AT}^2}{h_r^2-h_{AT}^2},\n\\label{chisgexact}\n\\end{equation}\nprovided $h_r > h_{AT}$ and $m > 2$. The simple divergence of $\\chi_{SG}$ as $h_r \\to h_{AT}$ is a feature of the SK limit and is not found in the Viana-Bray model at least amongst the quenched states of our numerical studies, see Sec. \\ref{sec:spinglasssusceptibility}\n\n\nWe now calculate the eigenvalue spectrum of \nthe Hessian matrix $\\mathsf{A}$. \nThe calculation closely follows the steps in Ref.~\\onlinecite{bm1982} for the case of zero external field.  \nWe consider (transverse) fluctuations around the $T=0$ solution $\\bm{S}^{0}_i\\equiv\\hat{\\bm{H}}_i$ by writing\n$\\bm{S}_i=\\bm{S}^{0}_i+\\bm{\\epsilon}_i$, where $\\bm{\\epsilon}_i=\\sum_\\alpha \\epsilon^\\alpha_i \\hat{\\bm{e}}_\\alpha(i)$\nwith the $(m-1)$ orthonormal vectors $\\hat{e}_\\alpha(i)$, $\\alpha=1,\\cdots,m-1$ satisfying\n$\\bm{S}^{0}_i\\cdot \\hat{\\bm{e}}_\\alpha(i)=0$. Inserting this into Eq.~(\\ref{Hamil}), we have the Hessian matrix\nas\n\\begin{equation}\nA^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}\\equiv\\frac{\\partial(\\mathcal{H}/m)}{\\partial\\epsilon^\\alpha_i \\partial\\epsilon^\\beta_j}\n=H_i\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{\\alpha\\beta}-J_{ij} \\hat{\\bm{e}}_\\alpha(i)\\cdot\\hat{\\bm{e}}_\\beta(j).\n\\end{equation}\nThe eigenvalue spectrum $\\rho(\\lambda)$ can be calculated from the resolvent \n$\\mathsf{G}=(\\lambda\\mathsf{I}-\\mathsf{A})^{-1}$ as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho(\\lambda)=\\frac{1}{N(m-1)\\pi}\\mathrm{Im} \\; \\mathrm{Tr} \\mathsf{G}(\\lambda-i\\delta),\n\\label{eqn:rho}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathsf{I}$ is the $(m-1)N$-dimensional unit matrix and $\\delta$ is an infinitesimal positive number.\nThe locator expansion method \\cite{bm1979} is used to evaluate $\\rho(\\lambda)$, which  yields the following\nself-consistent equation for $\\bar{G}(\\lambda)\\equiv ((m-1)N)^{-1} \\mathrm{Tr} \\mathsf{G}(\\lambda)$:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\bar{G}(\\lambda)=\\left\\langle \\frac 1{\\lambda-H-(1-\\frac 1 m)\\bar{G}(\\lambda)}\\right\\rangle,\n\\label{Gbar}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\langle ~\\rangle$ denotes the average over the distribution for $h$ given in the integrand in Eq.~(\\ref{I0}). \nNote that $H=h+\\bar{\\chi}$ and $\\bar{\\chi}=(1-1/m)\\langle 1/h\\rangle$ from Eq.~(\\ref{chi}).\nWe first separate $\\bar{G}=\\bar{G}^\\prime+i\\bar{G}^{\\prime\\prime}$ into real and imaginary parts and solve\nEq.~(\\ref{Gbar}) numerically for $\\bar{G}^\\prime(\\lambda)$ \nand $\\bar{G}^{\\prime\\prime}(\\lambda)$ as a function of $\\lambda$. \nThe eigenvalue spectrum is just $\\rho(\\lambda)=\\pi^{-1}\\bar{G}^{\\prime\\prime}(\\lambda)$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{rho_SK.eps} \n  \\caption{(Color online) The eigenvalue spectrum of the Hessian at zero temperature \n  for the vector spin glass with $m=3$ in the SK limit.The various lines correspond to different values of  \n  $h_r$,  the external random field.}\n  \\label{fig:rho}\n\\end{figure}\n\\vspace{0.2cm}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{rho_mag_SK.eps} \n  \\caption{(Color online) The magnified view of the same figure as Fig.~\\ref{fig:rho} but for the small eigenvalues.}\n  \\label{fig:rho_mag}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs we can see from Figs.~\\ref{fig:rho} and \\ref{fig:rho_mag}, $\\rho(\\lambda)$ does not change very much as \nwe increase $h_r$ from zero up to $h_{AT}=1$. \nFor the external field larger than the AT field, however, Fig.~\\ref{fig:rho_mag}\\\nclearly shows that the eigenvalue spectrum develops a gap. The gap increases with\nthe increasing external field. By directly working on Eq.~(\\ref{Gbar}) in \nthe small-$\\lambda$ limit, we find that for small eigenvalues\n\\begin{equation}\n \\rho(\\lambda)\\simeq \\frac{1}{\\pi(1-1/m)}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s}}\\sqrt{\\lambda-\\lambda_0},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $s=(1-m^{-1})\\langle 1/h^3 \\rangle$ and $\\lambda_0=\\lambda^2_R/4s$ with $\\lambda_R$ defined in Eq.~(\\ref{lambda_R}).\nOur numerical solution of the equations for $G(\\lambda)$ confirms that there is no gap below $h_{AT}$ which is consistent with the previous observation that $\\lambda_R$ vanishes\nthere. However,  the integral by which $s$ is defined diverges for $h_r > h_{AT}$ when $m <3$ and we no longer see a square root singularity at the band-edge. In the case of $m =3$ our numerical solution shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:rho_mag} suggests instead of the square root dependence there is a roughly linear dependence as $\\lambda$ approaches the numerically determined band-edge $\\lambda_0$, but unfortunately we have not been able to derive its form analytically. Fig. \\ref{fig:rho} shows that away from $\\lambda_0$ the density of states is rather as if it had the square root form. As $h_r \\to h_{AT}$ this square root form works all the way to zero.\n\n\\subsection{Quenched Average}\n\\label{sec:quenched}\nIn  this subsection, we  attempt to  evaluate the  quenched complexity\n$g(\\varepsilon)=N^{-1}\\langle\\ln     N_S(\\varepsilon)\\rangle$.     The\ncalculations  are  quite  complicated  and  some of  the  details  are\nsketched  in  the  Appendix.   In  order  to  calculate  $\\langle  \\ln\nN_S(\\varepsilon) \\rangle$,  we consider  an average of  the replicated\nquantity  $\\langle [N_S(\\varepsilon)]^n  \\rangle_{J,h^{\\rm  ex}}$.  We\nthen  have  an expression  similar  to  Eq.~(\\ref{NS_ann}), where  the\nintegrals  are  now  over  replicated variables,  $u^\\eta$,  $v^\\eta$,\n$\\bar{\\chi}^\\eta$   and  $\\lambda^\\eta$   with  the   replica  indices\n$\\eta,\\mu=1,\\cdots,n$.   In  addition to  these,  the expression  also\ninvolves  the  integrals  over  the  variables  carrying  off-diagonal\nreplica indices, which  are denoted by $A_{\\eta\\nu}$, $A^*_{\\eta\\nu}$,\n$B_{\\eta\\nu}$ and $B^*_{\\eta\\nu}$ with  $\\eta<\\nu$.  In the absence of\nexternal    field,    it    can    be   shown    \\cite{bm1981}    that\n$A_{\\eta\\nu}=A^*_{\\eta\\nu}  =B_{\\eta\\nu}=B^*_{\\eta\\nu}=0$ is  always a\nsolution to the saddle point equations.   It is shown to be stable for\n$\\varepsilon> E_c$  for the  $E_c$, for  which the\nquenched average  coincides with the  annealed one.  For  $h_r\\neq 0$,\nhowever,   we    find   that   this    is   no   longer    the   case.\n$A_{\\eta\\nu}=A^*_{\\eta\\nu}=B_{\\eta\\nu}=B^*_{\\eta\\nu}=0$   is   not   a\nsolution  to  saddle  point  equations.  The  saddle  point  solutions\ninvolve  nonvanishing off-diagonal variables  in replica  indices.  We\nfind that in general the saddle point equations are too complicated to\nallow  explicit  solutions.  (See  the  Appendix  for details.) \n\n  The\n quenched  average  is    different from  the\nannealed  one  for  a  finite  external field   when  $h_r<\nh_{AT}$.  When $h_r> h_{AT}$  the annealed  and quenched  averages are\nidentical  in  every  way  for  the  SK  model,  which  has  vanishing\ncomplexity in this region. We doubt whether the same statement is true\nfor  any  model  such  as  the Viana-Bray  model  which  has  non-zero\ncomplexity for $h_r > h_{AT}$. We also do not know for sure whether our replica\nsymmetric solution for $A_{\\eta \\nu}$  etc. is stable. It is possible\nthat even  at $u=0$  there is a  need to  go to full  replica symmetry\nbreaking.  Unfortunately \nalgebraic complexities  have prevented us from even finding a  solution of\nthe replica  symmetric equations,  so determining their  stability looks very challenging. However, the results of the numerical work reported on the form of $P(q)$ in Sec. \\ref{sec:metastability} for the Viana-Bray model in a field suggests that the states reached in the quench have replica symmetry.\n\nWe look for the saddle points in the replica symmetric form,\n\\begin{align}\n&A_{\\eta\\nu}=A,~~A^*_{\\eta\\nu}=A^*,~~B_{\\eta\\nu}=B^*_{\\eta\\nu}=B, \\nonumber \\\\\n&u^\\eta=u,~~v^\\eta=v,~~\\bar{\\chi}^\\eta=\\bar{\\chi},~~\\lambda^\\eta=\\lambda.\n\\end{align}\nAfter a lengthy calculation (see Appendix), we arrive at the expression for the quenched complexity as follows.\n\\begin{align}\ng(\\varepsilon)=&\nm \\Big\\{ -\\frac{\\Delta^2}{2} -\\varepsilon u   - \\frac{A}{2m}\n+\\frac{1}{2} (AA^*+B^2)\\Big\\} \n\\label{geps}  \\\\\n+&\n\\int \\frac{d^m \\bm{w}}{(2\\pi)^{m/2}}\n\\int \\frac{d^m \\bm{y}}{(2\\pi)^{m/2}}\n\\int \\frac{d^m \\bm{z} d^m\\bm{z}^*}{(2\\pi)^m}\\; \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\times \\exp[-\\frac 1 2 \\sum^m_\\alpha (w^2_\\alpha+y^2_\\alpha+z_\\alpha z^*_\\alpha)]\n\\; \\ln K(\\bm{w},\\bm{y},\\bm{z},\\bm{z}^*), \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\nwhere\n\\begin{align}\n K=&\n \\int d^m\\bm{h}\n \\int^{i\\infty}_{-i\\infty} \\frac{d^m \\bm{x}}{2\\pi i} \n \\;\\exp\\Bigg[\n \\frac{1-mA^*}{2m}\\bm{x}^2 \n \\nonumber \\\\\n&+ (h-\\Delta-B)\\bm{x}\\cdot\\hat{\\bm{h}}\n  -(m-1)\\frac{\\Delta + u/2}{h}\n -\\frac{m}{2}uh \\nonumber \\\\\n &+\n \\sqrt{A^*+\\frac{h^2_r}{m}} \\;\\bm{w}\\cdot\\bm{x}\n +\\sqrt{A+\\frac{mh^2_r}{4}u^2 }  \\; \\bm{y}\\cdot  \\hat{\\bm{h}} \\nonumber \\\\\n&+ \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}(B+\\frac{h^2_r}{2}u) }\n\\left(\\bm{z}\\cdot\\bm{x}+\\bm{z}^* \\cdot \\hat{\\bm{h}}\\right)\n \\Bigg].\n\\end{align}\nAll the parameters, $\\Delta$, $A$, $A^*$, $B$ and $u$ are to be determined in a variational way.\nWe found, however, that it is very difficult to solve the saddle point equations \nand obtain the quenched complexity, even numerically. \n\nFor the total number of metastable states, $u=0$, we can find a simple solution to saddle point equations at \n$\\Delta=A=B=0$ and $A^*=1/m$. In this case, $K=1$ and the complexity $g$ vanishes. This solution \nmust describe the case where $h_r>h_{AT}$ and it is identical to the annealed average.\nFor the external field $h_r$ just below $h_{AT}$, $\\Delta$, $A$, $B$ and $C\\equiv 1/m-A^*$\nare expected to be very small, and we may expand the integrals in Eq.~(\\ref{geps})\nin these variables.\nWe find after a very lengthy calculation that\n\\begin{equation}\n g\\simeq \n\\frac{m}{1+h^2_r} (h^2_{AT}-h^2_r)\\Big[  \\frac{\\Delta^2}{2}   + \\frac{AC}{2}\n -  \\frac{B^2}{2}  \\Big] .\n\\end{equation}\nNote that from Eq.~(\\ref{saddle}), we expect $B$ is pure imaginary. \nIn order to determine how these variables behave near $h_{AT}$, we need higher order terms.\nUnfortunately, the complicated nature of these equations, however, has prevented us from \ngoing beyond the quadratic orders. It seems natural to expect that the $\\Delta$ sector is decoupled \nfrom the off-diagonal variables, and so will have the same $\\Delta^3\\ln\\Delta$ behavior as in Eq.~(\\ref{gA0}). But the effort to obtain a full solution is so large that we abandoned further work on it. \n\n\n\\section{Hessian studies}\n\\label{sec:hessian}\n\nIn this section we write down the Hessian for the $m=3$ Heisenberg\nspin glass in a form which is convenient for numerical work. The\nHessian is of interest as it describes the nature of the energy of the\nspin glass in the vicinity of the minima. It is also closely related\nto the matrices needed to describe the spin waves in the system\n\\cite{bm1981}.  We follow the approach used in the paper of Beton and\nMoore~\\cite{beton1984electron} to find the elements of the Hessian\nmatrix $T$ corresponding to directions transverse to each spin subject\nto the above metastability condition. We first define the\nsite-dependent two-dimensional orthogonal unit vectors\n$\\hat{e}_{x}(i)$ and $\\hat{e}_{y}(i)$ such that\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{e}_{m}(i)\\cdot\\mathbf{S}_{i}^{0} &= 0\\\\\n\\hat{e}_{m}(i)\\cdot\\hat{e}_{n}(i) &= \\delta^{mn},\n\\end{align}\nwhere $m,n = x,y$ denotes the directions perpendicular to the spin at\nthe $i$th site, which is deemed in the $\\lq \\lq z\"$ direction. The\nlinear combinations\n$\\hat{e}_{i}^{\\pm}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{e}_{x}(i)\\pm\ni\\hat{e}_{y}(i))$ turn out to be particularly useful. Expanding\n$\\mathbf{S}_{i}$ about $\\mathbf{S}_{i}^{0}$, subject to the condition\nthat the length of the spins remains unchanged yields, upto\nsecond-order:\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{S}_{i} = \\mathbf{S}_{i}^{0}+\\Gamma_{i}^{x} \\hat{e}_{x}(i)+\\Gamma_{i}^{y} \\hat{e}_{y}(i)-\\frac{1}{2}[(\\Gamma_{i}^{x})^{2}+(\\Gamma_{i}^{y})^{2}]\\mathbf{S}_{i}^{0}.\n\\end{align}\nEquivalently, \n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{S}_{i} = \\mathbf{S}_{i}^{0}+Z_{i}^{-}\\hat{e}_{i}^{+}+Z_{i}^{+}\\hat{e}_{i}^{-}-Z_{i}^{-}Z_{i}^{+}\\mathbf{S}_{i}^{0},\n\\end{align}\nwhere $Z_{i}^{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\Gamma_{i}^{x}\\pm i\\Gamma_{i}^{y})$, and $(Z_{i}^{+})^{*}=Z_{i}^{-}$. Defining the $2N$-dimensional vector \n\\begin{align}\n|Z\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} Z_{i}^{-}\\\\ Z_{i}^{+} \\end{pmatrix},\n\\end{align}\nthe change in energy per spin component degree of freedom $\\frac{\\delta E}{3}$ due to a change in spin orientations $|Z\\rangle$, is given by:\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\delta E}{3} = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle Z|T|Z\\rangle,\n\\end{align}\nwhere $T$ is the $2N \\times 2N$ Hessian matrix given by\n\\begin{align*}\n\\begin{aligned}\nT = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  |\\mathbf{H}_{i}|\\delta_{ij}+A_{ij}^{*}  & B_{ij}^{*}\\\\\n  B_{ij}  & |\\mathbf{H}_{i}|\\delta_{ij}+A_{ij}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{aligned},\n\\end{align*}\nwhere the matrix elements are \n\\begin{align*}\nA_{ij} = A_{ji}^{*} = -3J_{ij}\\hat{e}_{i}^{+}\\cdot\\hat{e}_{j}^{-}\\\\\nB_{ij} = B_{ji}^{*} = -3J_{ij}\\hat{e}_{i}^{+}\\cdot\\hat{e}_{j}^{+}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nConverting to spherical coordinates, the matrix elements are \n\\begin{widetext}\n\\begin{align}\nA_{ij}^{*} &= - \\frac{3J_{ij}}{2}[(\\cos(\\theta_{i})\\cos(\\theta_{j})+1)\\cos(\\phi_{i}-\\phi_{j})+i(\\cos(\\theta_{i})+\\cos(\\theta_{j}))\\sin(\\phi_{i}-\\phi_{j})+\\sin(\\theta_{i})\\sin(\\theta_{j})]\\nonumber\\nonumber\\\\\nB_{ij}^{*} &= - \\frac{3J_{ij}}{2}[(\\cos(\\theta_{i})\\cos(\\theta_{j})-1)\\cos(\\phi_{i}-\\phi_{j})-i(\\cos(\\theta_{i})-\\cos(\\theta_{j}))\\sin(\\phi_{i}-\\phi_{j})+\\sin(\\theta_{i})\\sin(\\theta_{j})]\\nonumber\\\\\nB_{ij} &= - \\frac{3J_{ij}}{2}[(\\cos(\\theta_{i})\\cos(\\theta_{j})-1)\\cos(\\phi_{i}-\\phi_{j})+i(\\cos(\\theta_{i})-\\cos(\\theta_{j}))\\sin(\\phi_{i}-\\phi_{j})+\\sin(\\theta_{i})\\sin(\\theta_{j})]\\nonumber\\\\\nA_{ij} &= - \\frac{3J_{ij}}{2}[(\\cos(\\theta_{i})\\cos(\\theta_{j})+1)\\cos(\\phi_{i}-\\phi_{j})-i(\\cos(\\theta_{i})+\\cos(\\theta_{j}))\\sin(\\phi_{i}-\\phi_{j})+\\sin(\\theta_{i})\\sin(\\theta_{j})]\\nonumber\\\\\n\\end{align}.\n\\end{widetext}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig_SKchi.eps} \n  \\caption{(Color online) The inverse of the spin glass susceptibility $\\chi_{SG}^{-1}$ versus $h_r^2$ for a range of system sizes of the Heisenberg SK model.

Notice that for the SK\nmodel there is (weak) numerical evidence that $\\chi_{SG}$ diverges\nbelow the AT field. For the VB model, the plot of $\\chi_{SG}$ in\nFig. \\ref{fig1VB} obtained from our metastable states which lie above\nthe true ground state energy provides no evidence that an AT field has\nmuch relevance for these states.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig_dos.eps} \n  \\caption{(Color online) The averaged density of states of the Hessian matrix of the metastable states obtained after a quench to $T=0$ starting from spins with random orientations i.e. $T= \\infty$ for the SK model ($\\sigma =0, z =N-1$ of the diluted model).

The results have remarkable agreement with the analytical\ncalculation performed on the Heisenberg SK model as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}. The\nanalytical calculation itself is not for the same set of metastable\nstates.  It applies to the states corresponding to $u=0$ (i.e. those\nwith the largest complexity within the annealed approximation).  In\nFig.~\\ref{fig2}, data are shown for $h_r =0.8 h_{AT}$, where no gap is\npresent.  The agreement between the analytical curve which is obtained\nfor the thermodynamic limit, and the data for a $N=1024$ size system\nfrom numerical simulations, is striking. Notice that the $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$ form predicted from the annealed study (see Sec. \\ref{SKannealed}) seems to hold as $\\lambda \\to 0$, despite there being no Goldstone theorem in the presence of a random field to ensure the existence of massless modes.\n\nWe have also studied the density of states and quantities like the\ninverse participation ratios for the quenched state minima in models\nlike the VB model and the one-dimensional long range models. Basically\nthe results seem similar to those reported in\nRefs. \\onlinecite{baity2015soft} for the three dimensional Heisenberg\nspin glass model in a random field. But it requires large systems to\nget accurate results for the density of states at small values of\n$\\lambda$ and we are leaving these issues to a future publication.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:conclusions}\nWe believe that the most interesting feature which has turned up in\nour studies is the discovery for the SK model in zero external fields\nthat the quenched states reached for $m=2$ and $m =3$ are quite close\nto the critical energies $E_c$ at which the overlap of the states\nwould acquire features associated with a $P(q)$ with broken replica\nsymmetry. In the Ising SK model the local fields after the quench are\nso different from those used in the analytical calculations of $E_c$\nthat the connection of the quenched state to being just at the edge of\nthe states with broken replica symmetry was not recognized. Thus in\nsystems with marginal stability this means that features normally\nassociated with continuous phase transitions, in particular diverging\nlength scales, could be studied as in Ref. \\onlinecite{bm:81a}. \n\nWe have noticed too that the energy of the states reached from the quench\nhave zero overlap with each other. This behavior was predicted for the Ising case in Ref.~\\onlinecite{newman:99} by  Newman and Stein who proved that after a\nquench from infinite temperature for Ising systems the states which\nare reached have a characteristic energy and a trivial $P(q)$. It\nwould be good to extend their theorems to vector spin systems both in\nzero field and also in the presence of random fields.\n\nIn Sec. \\ref{sec:SKanalytic} we attempted to extend the old calculations of Bray and Moore \\cite{bm1981} which were for zero random field to non-zero random fields. For fields $h_r >h_{AT}$ where the complexity is zero, the annealed approximation is exact and we were able to obtain the exact form for the behaviour of the density of states of the Hessian matrix. There was found to be a gap in the spectrum which went to zero in the limit $h_r \\to h_{AT}$. When $h_r< h_{AT}$ one needs to study the quenched average in order to get results pertinent to typical minima, but we were not able to overcome the algebraic complexities (see Sec. \\ref{sec:quenched} and the Appendix), although the only difficulty is that of  solving the equations which we have obtained. If that could be done then one could investigate the limit of stability of the replica symmetric solution and determine\n$E_c(h_r)$. Then one could investigate whether a quench in a field $h_r$ takes one to the limit of stability towards full replica symmetry breaking i.e.  $E_c(h_r)$, just as we found for $h_r=0$.\n\nThe annealed approximation is  tractable but alas it is only an approximation. Nevertheless the studies in Sec. \\ref{sec:density} shows that it gives good results for the density of states of the Hessian for the SK model for $h_r < h_{AT}$. \n\nThe VB model is a mean-field model and one could hope that it too could be understood analytically, but we do not know how this might be achieved. Our numerical studies of the density of states of its Hessian indicates that this is very different from that of the SK model. This is probably because for the SK model all the eigenstates are extended, whereas for the VB model, eigenvectors can also be localized. In fact our results for the VB model are quite similar to those reported for the three dimensional Heisenberg spin glass in a field \\cite{baity2015soft}. There seems to be localized states lying in the gap region, all the way down to $\\lambda=0$.  But understanding the VB model analytically is very challenging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\acknowledgements\nWe should like to thank the authors of Ref.~\\onlinecite{lupo:16} for an advance copy of their paper and  helpful discussions.

{"text": "\\section{Introduction} \\label{sec:intro}\n\nThe production of hadrons and jets at a future Electron Ion Collider (EIC) will play a central role in understanding the structure of the protons and nuclei which comprise the visible matter in the universe.  Measurements of inclusive jet and hadron production with transversely polarized protons probe novel phenomena within the proton such as the Sivers function~\\cite{Kang:2011jw}, and address fundamental questions concerning the validity of QCD factorization.  Event shapes in jet production can give insight into the nuclear medium and its effect on particle propagation~\\cite{Kang:2012zr}.  The precision study of these processes at a future EIC will provide a much sharper image of proton and nucleus structure than is currently available.  Progress is needed on both the experimental and theoretical fronts to achieve this goal.  Currently, much of our knowledge of proton spin phenomena, such as the global fit to helicity-dependent structure functions~\\cite{deFlorian:2008mr}, comes from comparison to predictions at the next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant.  Theoretical predictions at the NLO level for jet and hadron production in DIS suffer from large theoretical uncertainties from uncalculated higher-order QCD corrections~\\cite{Hinderer:2015hra} that will eventually hinder the precision determination of proton structure.  In some cases even NLO is unknown, and an LO analysis fails to describe the available data~\\cite{Gamberg:2014eia}.  Given the high luminosity and expected precision possible with an EIC, it is desirable to extend the theoretical precision beyond what is currently available.  For many observables, a prediction to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the perturbative QCD expansion will ultimately be needed.\n\nAn important step toward improving the achievable precision for jet production in electron-nucleon collisions was taken in Ref.~\\cite{Hinderer:2015hra}, where the full NLO ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s)$ corrections to unpolarized $lN \\to jX$ and $lN \\to hX$ scattering were obtained.  Focusing on single-inclusive jet production for this discussion, it was pointed out that two distinct processes contribute: the deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) process $lN \\to ljX$, where the final-state lepton is resolved, and $\\gamma N \\to jX$, where the initial photon is almost on-shell and the final-state lepton is emitted collinear to the initial-state beam direction.  Both processes were found to contribute for expected EIC parameters, and the shift of the leading-order prediction was found to be both large and dependent on the final-state jet kinematics.\n\nOur goal in this manuscript is to present the full ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s^2)$ NNLO contributions to single-inclusive jet production in electron-nucleon collisions, including all the relevant partonic processes discussed above.  Achieving NNLO precision for jet and hadron production is a formidable task.  The relevant Feynman diagrams which give rise to the NNLO corrections consist of two-loop virtual corrections, one-loop real-emission diagrams, and double-real emission contributions.  Since these three pieces are separately infrared divergent, some way of regularizing and canceling these divergences must be found.  However, theoretical techniques for achieving this cancellation in the presence of final-state jets have seen great recent progress.  The introduction of the $N$-jettiness subtraction scheme for higher order QCD calculations~\\cite{Boughezal:2015dva,Gaunt:2015pea} has lead to the first complete NNLO descriptions of jet production processes in hadronic collisions.  During the past year several NNLO predictions for processes with final-state jets have become available due to this theoretical advance~\\cite{Boughezal:2015dva,Boughezal:2015aha,Boughezal:2015ded,Boughezal:2016dtm,Boughezal:2016isb,Boughezal:2016yfp}.  In some cases the NNLO corrections were critical in explaining the observed data~\\cite{Boughezal:2016yfp}.  We discuss here the application of the $N$-jettiness subtraction scheme to inclusive jet production in electron-proton collisions.   Our result includes both the DIS and photon-initiated contributions, and allows arbitrary selection cuts to be imposed on the final state.  Upon integration of the DIS terms over the final-state hadronic phase space we compare our result against the known NNLO prediction for the inclusive structure function, and we find complete agreement.  We present phenomenological results for proposed EIC parameters.  We find that all partonic channels, including new ones that first appear at this order, contribute in a non-trivial way to give the complete NNLO correction.  We note that the NNLO corrections to similar processes, massive charm-quark production in deeply inelastic scattering and dijet production, were recently obtained~\\cite{Berger:2016inr,Currie:2016ytq}.\n\n\n\\section{Lower-order results}\\label{sec:low}\n\nWe begin by discussing our notation for the hadronic and partonic cross sections, and outlining the expressions for the LO and NLO cross sections.  We will express the hadronic cross section in the following notation:\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\rm d}\\sigma = {\\rm d}\\sigma_{\\text{LO}}+{\\rm d}\\sigma_{\\rm NLO}+{\\rm d}\\sigma_{\\rm NNLO}+\\ldots \\,,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the ellipsis denotes neglected higher-order terms.  The LO subscript refers to the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2)$ term, the NLO subscript denotes the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s)$ correction, while the NNLO subscript indicates the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s^2)$ contribution.  For the partonic cross sections, we introduce superscripts that denote the powers of both $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha_s$ that appear.  For example, the leading quark-lepton scattering process is expanded as \n\\begin{equation}\n{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{ql}= {\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{ql}^{(2,0)}+{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{ql}^{(2,1)}+{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{ql}^{(2,2)}+\\ldots \\,.\n\\end{equation}\nHere, the ${\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{ql}^{(2,0)}$ denotes the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2)$ correction, while ${\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{ql}^{(2,1)}$ indicates the  ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s)$ term.\n\n The leading-order hadronic cross section can be written as a convolution of parton distribution functions with a partonic cross section, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:sigLO}\n{\\rm d}\\sigma_{\\text{LO}} &=& \\int \\frac{{\\rm d} \\xi_1}{\\xi_1} \\frac{{\\rm d} \\xi_2}{\\xi_2} \\sum_q \\left[ f_{q/H}(\\xi_1) f_{l/l}(\\xi_2) {\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{ql}^{(2,0)} \\right. \\\\ \\nonumber\n\t&+& \\left. f_{\\bar{q}/H}(\\xi_1) f_{l/l}(\\xi_2) {\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{q}l}^{(2,0)}\\right]. \n\\end{eqnarray} \nHere, $f_{q/H}(\\xi_1)$ is the usual parton distribution function that describes the distributions of a quark $q$ in the hadron $H$ carrying a fraction $\\xi_1$ of the hadron momentum.  $f_{l/l}(\\xi_2)$ is the distribution for finding a lepton with momentum fraction $\\xi_2$ inside the original lepton.  At leading order this is just $f_{l/l}(\\xi_2)=\\delta(1-\\xi_2)$, but it is modified at higher orders in the electromagnetic coupling by photon emission.  \n$d\\hat{\\sigma}_{ql}^{(2,0)}$ is the differential partonic cross section.  At leading order only the partonic channel $q(p_1)+l(p_2) \\to q(p_3)+l(p_4)$ and the same process with anti-quarks instead contribute.  The relevant Feynman diagram is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:LOdiag}. It is straightforward to obtain these terms.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{LO.pdf}%\n\\caption{Feynman diagram for the leading-order process $q(p_1)+l(p_2) \\to q_(p_3)+l(p_4)$.  We have colored the photon line red, the lepton lines green and the quark lines black.} \\label{fig:LOdiag}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nAt the next-to-leading order level several new contributions first occur.  The quark-lepton scattering channel that appears at LO receives both virtual and real-emission corrections that are separately infrared divergent.  We use the antennae subtraction method~\\cite{Kosower:1997zr} to regularize and cancel these divergences.  Initial-state collinear divergences are handled as usual by absorbing them into the PDFs via mass factorization.   A gluon-lepton scattering channel also contributes at this order.  The collinear divergences that appear in these contributions are removed by mass factorization.  Example Feynman diagrams for these processes are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:NLOlepdiag}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{NLOlep.pdf}%\n\\caption{Representative Feynman diagrams contributing to the following perturbative QCD corrections at NLO: virtual corrections to the \n$q(p_1)+l(p_2) \\to q(p_3)+l(p_4)$ process (left); real emission correction $q(p_1)+l(p_2) \\to q(p_3)+l(p_4)+g(p_5)$ (middle); the process $g(p_1)+l(p_2) \\to q_(p_3) +l(p_4)+\\bar{q}(p_5)$ (right).  We have colored the photon line red, the lepton lines green, the gluon lines blue and the quark lines black.} \\label{fig:NLOlepdiag}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe processes discussed above exhaust the possible NLO contributions when the final-state lepton is observed.  However,  for single-inclusive jet production a kinematic configuration is allowed where the $t$-channel photon is nearly on-shell, and the final-state lepton travels down the beam pipe. The transverse momentum of the leading jet is balanced by the additional jet present in these diagrams.  This kinematic configuration leads to a QED collinear divergence for vanishing lepton mass, since the photon can become exactly on-shell in this limit.  While it is regulated by the lepton mass, it is more convenient to obtain these corrections by introducing a photon distribution function in analogy with the usual parton distribution function.  The collinear divergences that appear in the matrix elements computed with vanishing lepton mass can be absorbed into this distribution function, which can be calculated in perturbation theory.  Representative diagrams for the photon-initiated processes are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:NLOphotdiag}.\n \n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{NLOphot.pdf}%\n\\caption{Representative Feynman diagrams contributing to the $q(p_1)+\\gamma(p_2) \\to q(p_3)+g(p_4)$ (left) and $g(p_1)+\\gamma(p_2) \\to q(p_3)+\\bar{q}(p_4)$ scattering processes.} \\label{fig:NLOphotdiag}\n\\end{figure}\n \n \nThe full expression for the NLO hadronic cross section then takes the form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{eq:hxsecnlo}\n{\\rm d}\\sigma_{\\rm NLO}&=&\\int\\frac{{\\rm d}\\xi_1}{\\xi_1}\\frac{{\\rm d}\\xi_2}{\\xi_2}\\bigg\\{f_{g/H}^1f_{l/l}^2 {\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{gl}^{(2,1)} + f_{g/H}^1f_{\\gamma/l}^2{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{g\\gamma}^{(1,1)} \\phantom{\\sum_q}\\nonumber \\\\\n&& +\\sum_q\\bigg[f_{q/H}^1f_{l/l}^2{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{ql}^{(2,1)}+f_{\\bar{q}/H}^1f_{l/l}^2{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{q}l}^{(2,1)} \\nonumber \\\\\n&&+f_{q/H}^1f_{\\gamma/l}^2{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{q\\gamma}^{(1,1)}+f_{\\bar{q}/H}^1f_{\\gamma/l}^2{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{q}\\gamma}^{(2,1)}\\bigg]\\bigg\\},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere we have abbreviated $f_{i/j}^k=f_{i/j}(\\xi_k)$.  The contributions ${\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{gl}^{(2,1)}$, ${\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{ql}^{(2,1)}$ and ${\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{q}l}^{(2,1)}$ denote the usual DIS partonic channels computed to NLO in QCD with zero lepton mass.  The terms ${\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{q}\\gamma,\\rm LO}$ and ${\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{g\\gamma,\\rm LO}$ denote the new contributions arising when $Q^2 \\approx 0$ and the virtual photon is nearly on-shell.  The photon distribution can be expressed as\n\\begin{equation}\nf_{\\gamma/l}(\\xi) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi} P_{\\gamma l}(\\xi) \\left[ \\text{ln}\\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{\\xi^2 m_l^2} \\right)-1\\right] +{\\cal O}(\\alpha^2),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the splitting function is given by\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:gammalsplit}\nP_{\\gamma l}(\\xi) = \\frac{1+(1-\\xi)^2}{\\xi}.\n\\end{equation} \nThis is the well-known Weizs\\\"{a}cker-Williams (WW) distribution for the photon inside of a lepton~\\cite{WW}.  The appearance of the renormalization scale $\\mu$ indicates that an $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ subtraction of the QED collinear divergence is used in the calculation of the $gl$ and $ql$ scattering channels, and consequently in the derivation of the photon distribution function. \n\n\\section{Calculation of the NNLO result} \\label{sec:nnlo}\n\nThe calculation of the full ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s^2)$ corrections involves several distinct contributions.  The quark-lepton and gluon-lepton scattering channels receive two-loop double virtual corrections, one-loop corrections to single real-emission diagrams, and double-real emission corrections.  These contributions necessitate the use of a full-fledged NNLO subtraction scheme.  We use the recently-developed $N$-jettiness subtraction scheme~\\cite{Boughezal:2015dva,Gaunt:2015pea}.  Its application to this process is discussed here in detail.  In addition, the photon-initiated scattering channels receive virtual and single real-emission corrections.  The calculation of these terms follows the standard application of the antennae subtraction scheme at NLO. \n\nThere is in addition a new effect that appears at the NNLO level.  The initial-state lepton can emit a photon which splits into a $q\\bar{q}$ pair, all of which are collinear to the initial lepton direction.  In the limit of vanishing fermion masses there is a collinear singularity associated with this contribution.  This divergence appears in the quark-lepton, gluon-lepton, and photon-initiated scattering channels.  It can be absorbed into a distribution function that describes the quark distribution inside a lepton.  Treating the collinear singularity in this way leads to new scattering channels that first appear at NNLO: $q\\bar{q} \\to q\\bar{q}$, $q\\bar{q} \\to q^{\\prime}\\bar{q}^{\\prime}$, $q\\bar{q} \\to gg$, $qq^{\\prime} \\to qq^{\\prime}$, and $qg \\to qg$.  For our numerical predictions for these channels we need the quark distribution in a lepton.  We obtain this by solving the DGLAP equation, which to the order we are working can be written as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{eq.dglap}\n&&\\mu^2\\frac{\\partial f_{q/l}}{\\partial \\mu^2}(\\xi,\\mu^2)=e_q^2\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi}\\int_{\\xi}^1\\frac{{\\rm d} z}{z}P_{q\\gamma}^{(0)}(z)\\,f_{\\gamma/l}\\left(\\frac{\\xi}{z},\\mu^2\\right) \\nonumber \\\\ &&+ e_q^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi}\\right)^2\\int_{\\xi}^1\\frac{{\\rm d} z}{z}P_{ql}^{(1)}(z)\\,f_{l/l}\\left(\\frac{\\xi}{z},\\mu^2\\right),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the two needed splitting kernels are\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nP_{q\\gamma}^{(0)}(x)&=&x^2+(1-x)^2, \\nonumber \\\\\nP_{ql}^{(1)}(x) &=& -2+\\frac{20}{9x}+6x-\\frac{56x^2}{9}\\nonumber \\\\ &&\\hspace{-0.8cm}+\\left(1+5x+\\frac{8x^2}{3}\\right) \\log(x)-(1+x) \\log^2(x).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThis expression for the NLO splitting kernel can be obtained from upon replacement of the appropriate QCD couplings with electromagnetic ones.  To derive the full quark-in-lepton distribution we use as an initial condition $ f_{q/l}(\\xi,m_l^2)=0$. Solving Eq.~(\\ref{eq.dglap}) with this initial condition gives\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:qinl}\n&&f_{q/l}(\\xi,\\mu^2)=e_q^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi}\\right)^2\\bigg\\{\\bigg[\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{2}{3\\xi}-\\frac{\\xi}{2}-\\frac{2\\xi^2}{3} \\nonumber \\\\ && +(1+\\xi)\\log\\xi \\bigg]  \\log^2\\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{m_l^2}\\right) + \\bigg[-3-\\frac{2}{\\xi}+7\\xi-2\\xi^2+\\nonumber \\\\ &&\\bigg( -5 -\\frac{8}{3\\xi}+\\xi+\\frac{8\\xi^2}{3}\\bigg)\\log(\\xi)-3(1+x)\\log^2(\\xi)\\bigg] \\nonumber \\\\ && \\times \\log\\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{m_l^2}\\right).\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{NNLO2jet.pdf}%\n\\caption{Representative Feynman diagrams contributing to the $q(p_1)+\\bar{q}(p_2) \\to g(p_3)+g(p_4)$ (left), $q(p_1)+q^{\\prime}(p_2) \\to q(p_3)+q^{\\prime}(p_4)$ (middle), and $q(p_1)+g(p_2) \\to q(p_3)+g(p_4)$ (right) scattering processes.} \\label{fig:NNLO2jet}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWith this distribution function it is straightforward to obtain numerical predictions for these partonic channels.  Representative Feynman diagrams for these processes are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:NNLO2jet}.  We can now write down the full result for the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2 \\alpha_s^2)$ correction to the cross section:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:hxsecnnlo}\n{\\rm d}\\sigma_{\\rm NNLO}&=&\\int\\frac{{\\rm d}\\xi_1 {\\rm d}\\xi_2}{\\xi_1 \\xi_2}\\bigg\\{f_{g/H}^1f_{l/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{gl}^{(2,2)}\n+f_{g/H}^1f_{\\gamma/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{g\\gamma}^{(1,2)} \\phantom{\\sum_q}\\nonumber \\\\\n&+&\\sum_q\\bigg[f_{g/H}^1f_{q/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{gq}^{(0,2)}+f_{g/H}^1f_{\\bar{q}/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{g\\bar{q}}^{(0,2)}\\bigg] \\nonumber\\\\\n&+&\\sum_q\\bigg[f_{q/H}^1f_{l/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{ql}^{(2,2)}+f_{\\bar{q}/H}^1f_{l/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{q}l}^{(2,2)} \\nonumber \\\\\n&+&f_{q/H}^1f_{\\gamma/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{q\\gamma}^{(1,2)}+f_{\\bar{q}/H}^1f_{\\gamma/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{q}\\gamma}^{(1,2)} \\phantom{\\sum_q\\bigg[} \\nonumber \\\\\n&+&f_{q/H}^1f_{\\bar{q}/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{q\\bar{q}}^{(0,2)}+f_{\\bar{q}/H}^1f_{q/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{q}q}^{(0,2)} \\bigg] \\phantom{\\sum_q} \\nonumber \\\\\n&+&\\sum_{q,q'}\\bigg[f_{q/H}^1f_{q'/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{qq'}^{(0,2)}+f_{\\bar{q}/H}^1f_{\\bar{q}'/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{q}\\bar{q}'}^{(0,2)}  \\nonumber \\\\\n&+&f_{q/H}^1f_{\\bar{q}'/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{q\\bar{q}'}^{(0,2)}+f_{\\bar{q}/H}^1f_{q'/l}^2\\,{\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{q}q'}^{(0,2)}\\bigg]\\bigg\\}. \\phantom{\\sum_q}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\nThe most difficult contribution is the quark-lepton scattering channel.  It receives contributions from two-loop virtual corrections (double-virtual), one-loop corrections to single real emission terms (real-virtual), and double-real emission corrections.  Sample Feynman diagrams for these corrections are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:NNLOql}.  These are separately infrared divergent, and require a full NNLO subtraction scheme to combine.  We apply the $N$-jettiness subtraction scheme~\\cite{Boughezal:2015dva,Gaunt:2015pea}.  The starting point of this method is the $N$-jettiness event shape variable~\\cite{Stewart:2010tn}, defined in the one-jet case of current interest as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:taudef}\n{\\cal T}_1 = \\frac{2}{Q^2} \\sum_i \\text{min}\\left\\{p_B \\cdot q_i, p_J \\cdot q_i \\right\\},\n\\end{equation}\nwith $Q^2 = -(p_2-p_4)^2$.  Here, $p_B$ and $p_J$ are light-like four-vectors along the initial-state hadronic beam and final-state jet directions, respectively.\\footnote{This choice of ${\\cal T}_1$ corresponds to $\\tau_1^a$ in Ref.~\\cite{Kang:2013nha}.  We note that this definition is dimensionless, unlike the choice in previous applications of $N$-jettiness subtraction~\\cite{Boughezal:2015dva}.}  The $q_i$ denote the four-momenta of all final-state partons.   Values of ${\\cal T}_1$ near zero indicate a final state containing a single narrow energy deposition, while larger values denote a final state containing two or more well-separated energy depositions.  A measurement of ${\\cal T}_1$ is itself of phenomenological interest.  It has been proposed as a probe of nuclear properties in electron-ion collisions~\\cite{Kang:2012zr,Kang:2013wca}, and has also been suggested as a way to precisely determine the strong coupling constant~\\cite{Kang:2013nha}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{NNLOql.pdf}%\n\\caption{Representative Feynman diagrams contributing to the quark-lepton scattering channel at NNLO.} \\label{fig:NNLOql}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWe will use ${\\cal T}_1$ to establish the complete ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s^2)$ calculation of  the quark-lepton  scattering channel.  Our ability to do so relies on two key observations, as first discussed in Ref.~\\cite{Boughezal:2015dva} for a general $N$-jet process.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item Restricting ${\\cal T}_1 >0$ removes all doubly-unresolved limits of the quark-lepton matrix elements, for example when the two additional partons that appear in the double-real emission corrections are soft or collinear to the beam or the final-state jet.  This can be seen from Eq.~(\\ref{eq:taudef}); if ${\\cal T}_1 >0$ then at least one $q_i$ must be resolved.  Since all doubly-unresolved limits are removed, the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s^2)$ correction in this phase space region can be obtained from an NLO calculation of two-jet production in electron-nucleon collisions.  \n\n\\item When ${\\cal T}_1$ is smaller than any other hard scale in the problem, it can be resummed to all orders in perturbation theory~\\cite{Stewart:2009yx,Stewart:2010pd}.  Expansion of this resummation formula to ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s^2)$ gives the NNLO correction to the quark-lepton scattering channel for small ${\\cal T}_1$.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\nThe path to a full NNLO calculation is now clear.   We partition the phase space for the real-virtual and double-real corrections\ninto regions above and below a cutoff on ${\\cal T}_1$, which we label ${\\cal T}_1^{cut}$:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:partition}\n\\begin{split}\n{\\rm d}\\sigma_{ql}^{(2,2)} &= \\int {\\rm d}\\Phi_{\\text{VV}} \\, |{\\cal M}_{\\text{VV}}|^2 +\\int {\\rm d}\\Phi_{\\text{RV}} \\, |{\\cal M}_{\\text{RV}}|^2 \\, \\theta_1^{<} \\\\\n&+\\int {\\rm d}\\Phi_{\\text{RR}} \\, |{\\cal M}_{\\text{RR}}|^2 \\, \\theta_1^{<}+\\int {\\rm d}\\Phi_{\\text{RV}} \\, |{\\cal M}_{\\text{RV}}|^2 \\, \\theta_1^{>} \\\\\n&+\\int {\\rm d}\\Phi_{\\text{RR}} \\, |{\\cal M}_{\\text{RR}}|^2 \\, \\theta_1^{>} \\\\\n \\equiv & {\\rm d}\\sigma_{ql}^{(2,2)}({\\cal T}_1 < {\\cal T}_1^{cut})+{\\rm d}\\sigma_{ql}^{(2,2)}({\\cal T}_1 > {\\cal T}_1^{cut})\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\nWe have abbreviated $\\theta_1^{<} = \\theta({\\cal T}_1^{cut}-{\\cal T}_1)$ and $\\theta_1^{>} = \\theta({\\cal T}_1-{\\cal T}_1^{cut})$.  The first three terms in this expression all have ${\\cal T}_1<{\\cal T}_1^{cut}$, and have been collectively denoted as ${\\rm d}\\sigma_{ql}^{(2,2)}({\\cal T}_1 < {\\cal T}_1^{cut})$.  The remaining two terms have ${\\cal T}_1>{\\cal T}_1^{cut}$, and have been collectively denoted as ${\\rm d}\\sigma_{ql}^{(2,2)}({\\cal T}_1 > {\\cal T}_1^{cut})$.  The double-virtual corrections necessarily have ${\\cal T}_1=0$.  We obtain ${\\rm d}\\sigma_{ql}^{(2,2)}({\\cal T}_1 > {\\cal T}_1^{cut})$ from a NLO calculation of two-jet production.  This is possible since no genuine double-unresolved limit occurs in this phase-space region.  We discuss the calculation of  ${\\rm d}\\sigma_{ql}^{(2,2)}({\\cal T}_1 < {\\cal T}_1^{cut})$ using the all-orders resummation of this process in the following sub-section.  We note that only the quark-lepton and gluon-lepton scattering channels have support for ${\\cal T}_1=0$.  For the other processes there are two final-state jets with non-zero transverse momentum.  Such configurations necessarily have ${\\cal T}_1 >0$, and therefore only receive contributions from the \nabove-the-cut phase-space region.  We only need these contributions to at most NLO in QCD perturbation theory, which can be obtained via standard techniques.  We use antennae subtraction.  The only non-standard aspect of this NLO calculation is the appearance of triple-collinear QED limits associated with the emission of a photon and a $q\\bar{q}$ pair which require the use of integrated antennae found in Refs.~\\cite{Daleo:2009yj,Boughezal:2010mc,GehrmannDeRidder:2012ja}.  A powerful aspect of the $N$-jettiness subtraction method is its ability to upgrade existing NLO calculations to NNLO precision.   Previous applications of $N$-jettiness subtraction~\\cite{Boughezal:2015dva,Boughezal:2015aha,Boughezal:2015ded} have used the NLO dipole subtraction technique~\\cite{Catani:1996vz} to facilitate the calculation of the above-cut phase-space region.  This work demonstrates that it can also be used in conjunction with the NLO antennae subtraction scheme.  \n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Below ${\\cal T}_1^{cut}$}\n\nAn all-orders resummation of the ${\\cal T}_1$ event-shape variable in the DIS process for the limit ${\\cal T}_1 \\ll 1$ was constructed in Refs.~\\cite{Kang:2013wca,Kang:2013nha}:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:SCETfac}\n\\frac{{\\rm d} \\sigma}{{\\rm d} {\\cal T}_1} &=& \\int {\\rm d}  \\Phi_2(p_3,p_4;p_1,p_2) \\int {\\rm d} t_J {\\rm d} t_B {\\rm d} k_S  \\nonumber \\\\ &\\times & \\delta\\left( {\\cal T}_1-\\frac{t_J}{Q^2}-\\frac{t_B}{Q^2} -\\frac{k_S}{Q} \\right)  \\nonumber \\\\ &\\times & \\sum_q J_q(t_J,\\mu) \\,S(k_S,\\mu)\n H_q(\\Phi_2,\\mu) B_q(t_B,x,\\mu)+ \\ldots \\nonumber \\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}  \nWe have allowed the index $q$ to run over both quarks and anti-quarks.  $x$ denotes the usual Bjorken scaling variable for DIS:\n\\begin{equation}\nx = \\frac{Q^2}{2 P\\cdot (p_2-p_4)},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $P$ is the initial-state nucleon four-momentum.  $\\Phi_2$ denotes the Born phase space, which consists of a quark and a lepton.  The derivation of this result relies heavily on the machinery of soft-collinear effective theory (SCET)~\\cite{Bauer:2000ew}.  A summary of the SCET functions that appear in this expression and what they describe is given below.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item $H$ is the hard function that encodes the effect of hard virtual corrections.  At leading order in its $\\alpha_s$ expansion it reduces to the leading-order partonic cross section.  At higher orders it also contains the finite contributions of the pure virtual corrections, renormalized using the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme.  It depends only on the Born-level kinematics and on the scale choice.\n\n\\item $J_q$, the quark jet function, describes the effect of radiation collinear to the final-state jet (which for this process is initiated by a quark at LO).  It depends on $t_J$, the contribution of final-state collinear radiation to ${\\cal T}_1$.  It possesses a perturbative expansion in $\\alpha_s$.\n\n\\item $S$ is the soft function that encodes the contributions of soft radiation.   It depends on $k_S$, the contribution of soft radiation to ${\\cal T}_1$, and has a perturbative expansion in $\\alpha_s$.\n\n\\item $B$ is the beam function that contains the effects of initial-state collinear radiation.  It depends on $t_B$, the contribution of initial-state collinear radiation to ${\\cal T}_1$.  The beam function is non-perturbative; however, up to corrections suppressed by $\\Lambda^2_{\\text{QCD}}/t_B$, it can be written as a convolution of perturbative matching coefficients and the usual PDFs:\n\\begin{equation}\nB_q(t_B,x,\\mu) = \\sum_i \\int_x^1 \\frac{{\\rm d} \\xi}{\\xi} {\\cal I}_{qi} (t_B,x/\\xi,\\mu) f_{i/H}(\\xi),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere we have suppressed the scale dependence of the PDF, and $i$ runs over all partons.\n\n\\end{itemize}\nThe delta function appearing in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCETfac}) combines the contribution of each type of radiation to produce the measured value of ${\\cal T}_1$.  The ellipsis denotes power corrections that are small as long as we restrict ourselves to the phase-space region ${\\cal T}_1 \\ll 1$. \n\nThe hard, jet, and soft functions as well as the beam-function matching coefficients all have perturbative expansions in $\\alpha_s$ that can be obtained from the literature~\\cite{Zijlstra:1992qd,Becher:2006qw,Gaunt:2014xga,Boughezal:2015eha}.  Upon expansion to ${\\cal  O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ and integration over the region ${\\cal T}_1 < {\\cal T}_1^{cut}$, Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCETfac}) will give exactly the cross section ${\\rm d}\\sigma_{ql}^{(2,2)}({\\cal T}_1 < {\\cal T}_1^{cut})$ that we require.  We can match the beam function onto the PDFs and rewrite the cross section below the cut as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\rm d}\\sigma &=& \\int \\frac{{\\rm d} \\xi_1}{\\xi_1} \\frac{{\\rm d} \\xi_2}{\\xi_2} \\sum_{q,i}  f_{i/H}(\\xi_1) f_{l/l}(\\xi_2)  \\int {\\rm d}  \\Phi_2(p_3,p_4;p_1,p_2) \\nonumber \\\\ && \\int_0^{{\\cal T}_1^{cut}} {\\rm d} {\\cal T}_1 \\int {\\rm d} t_J {\\rm d} t_B {\\rm d} k_S \\delta\\left( {\\cal T}_1-\\frac{t_J}{Q^2}-\\frac{t_B}{Q^2} -\\frac{k_S}{Q} \\right)  \\nonumber \\\\ &\\times &  J_q(t_J,\\mu) \\,S(k_S,\\mu)\n H_q(\\Phi_2,\\mu) \\, {\\cal I}_{qi} (t_B,x/\\xi,\\mu) \\nonumber \\\\\n&\\equiv& \\sum_{q,i} \\int {\\rm d}\\Phi^{i}_{\\text{Born}} \\, \\left[ J_q \\otimes S \\otimes H_q \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi} \\right].\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe have introduced the schematic notation $J_q \\otimes S \\otimes H_q \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}$ for the integrations of the SCET functions over ${\\cal T}_1$, $t_J$, $t_B$, and $k_S$; ${\\rm d}\\Phi^{i}_{\\text{Born}}$ represents all other terms for the given index $i$: the parton distribution functions, the integral over the Born phase space, and any measurement function acting on the Born variables.  We denote the expansion of these functions in $\\alpha_s$ as\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\cal X} = {\\cal X}^{(0)}+{\\cal X}^{(1)}+{\\cal X}^{(2)}+\\ldots,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the superscript denotes the power of $\\alpha_s$ appearing in each term.  With this notation, we need the following contributions to obtain the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ correction to the cross section below ${\\cal T}_1^{cut}$: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:belowcutexp}\n{\\rm d}\\sigma_{\\text{NNLO}} &=& \\sum_{q,i} \\int {\\rm d}\\Phi^i_{\\text{Born}} \\, \\bigg\\{J_q^{(2)} \\otimes S^{(0)} \\otimes H_q^{(0)} \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(0)} \\nonumber \\\\\n\t&+&J_q^{(0)} \\otimes S^{(2)} \\otimes H_q^{(0)} \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(0)} + J_q^{(0)} \\otimes S^{(0)} \\otimes H_q^{(2)} \\nonumber \\\\ &\\otimes & \n\t{\\cal I}_{qi}^{(0)}+J_q^{(0)} \\otimes S^{(0)} \\otimes H_q^{(0)} \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(2)} \\nonumber \\\\ \n\t&+&J_q^{(1)} \\otimes S^{(1)} \\otimes H_q^{(0)} \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(0)}+J_q^{(1)} \\otimes S^{(0)} \\otimes H_q^{(1)} \\nonumber \\\\ &\\otimes & {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(0)}\n\t+J_q^{(1)} \\otimes S^{(0)} \\otimes H_q^{(0)} \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(1)}+J_q^{(0)} \\otimes  S^{(1)}  \\nonumber \\\\ & \\otimes &H_q^{(1)} \\otimes  {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(0)} \n\t+ J_q^{(0)} \\otimes S^{(1)} \\otimes H_q^{(0)} \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(1)}\\nonumber \\\\ &+& J_q^{(0)} \\otimes S^{(0)} \\otimes H_q^{(1)} \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(1)} \\bigg\\}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nTo simplify this expression, we first note that the hard function has no dependence on the hadronic variables ${\\cal T}_1$, $t_J$, $t_B$, and $k_S$.  It depends only on the Born phase space and is a multiplicative factor for the hadronic integrations.  Next, we note that the leading-order expressions for the SCET functions are proportional to delta functions in their respective hadronic variable:\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\cal X}^{(0)} \\propto \\delta(t_{\\cal X})\n\\end{equation} \nfor ${\\cal X}=J_q, S$, or ${\\cal I}_{qi}$. This simplifies the integrals involving an ${\\cal X}^{(2)}$.  Using the $J_q^{(2)}$ term in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:belowcutexp}) as an example, we have\n\\begin{equation}\nJ_q^{(2)} \\otimes S^{(0)} \\otimes H_q^{(0)} \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(0)} = Q^2 H_q^{(0)} \\delta_{qi}\\, \\int_0^{{\\cal T}_1^{cut}} \\hspace{-0.5cm}{\\rm d} {\\cal T}_1 J_q^{(2)} ({\\cal T}_1 Q^2,\\mu),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the $\\delta_{qi}$ comes from the ${\\cal I}_{qi}^{(0)}$ term.  Using the fact that the jet function can be written in the form \n\\begin{equation}\nJ_q^{(2)} (t_J,\\mu) = a_{-1} \\delta(t_J)+\\sum_{n=0}^3 a_n \\, \\frac{1}{\\mu^2} \\left[  \\frac{\\mu^2 \\,\\text{ln}^n(t_J/\\mu^2)}{t_J}\\right]_+,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the $a_i$ denote coefficients that can be found in the literature~\\cite{Becher:2006qw}, we can immediately derive \n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\nJ_q^{(2)} \\otimes S^{(0)} \\otimes H_q^{(0)} & \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(0)} = H_q^{(0)} \\,\\delta_{qi} \\left\\{ a_{-1} \\right. \\\\ & \\left. +\\sum_{n=0}^3 \\frac{1}{n+1} a_{n+1} \\,\\text{ln}^{n+1} \\left( \\frac{{\\cal T}_1^{cut} Q^2}{\\mu^2}\\right)\\right\\}.\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation} \nWe have used the standard definition of the plus distribution of a function:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\int_0^1 {\\rm d} x \\, \\left[f(x)\\right]_+ \\, g(x) = \\int_0^1 {\\rm d} x \\, f(x) \\left[g(x)-g(0) \\right].\n\\end{equation}\nThis analysis shows how to analytically calculate any term containing one of the NNLO SCET functions.  \n\nIt remains only to calculate contributions containing two NLO SCET functions.  We focus on $J_q^{(1)} \\otimes S^{(1)} \\otimes H_q^{(0)} \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(0)} $ as an example.  Using the LO expression for the beam function we can immediately derive the equation\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\nJ_q^{(1)} \\otimes S^{(1)} \\otimes H_q^{(0)} &\\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(0)} = Q \\, H_q^{(0)} \\,\\delta_{qi}\\, \\int_0^{{\\cal T}_1^{cut}} \\hspace{-0.5cm}{\\rm d} {\\cal T}_1 \\int_0^{{\\cal T}_1 Q} dt_J \\\\ & \\times\n\tJ_q^{(1)} (t_J,\\mu) \\, S^{(1)}\\left(Q{\\cal T}_1-\\frac{t_J}{Q} \\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\nThe NLO results for the jet and soft functions can be written as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nJ_q^{(1)} (t_J,\\mu) &=& b_{-1} \\delta(t_J)+\\sum_{n=0}^1 b_n \\, \\frac{1}{\\mu^2} \\left[  \\frac{\\mu^2 \\,\\text{ln}^n(t_J/\\mu^2)}{t_J}\\right]_+, \\nonumber \\\\\nS^{(1)} (k_S,\\mu) &=& c_{-1} \\delta(k_S)+\\sum_{n=0}^1 c_n \\, \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left[  \\frac{\\mu \\,\\text{ln}^n(k_S/\\mu)}{k_S}\\right]_+ .\n\\end{eqnarray} \nUsing these expressions it is straightforward to derive the result\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nJ_q^{(1)} &\\otimes& S^{(1)} \\otimes H_q^{(0)} \\otimes {\\cal I}_{qi}^{(0)} = H_q^{(0)} \\,\\delta_{qi} \\bigg\\{ b_{-1} c_{-1} \n\\nonumber \\\\ &+& c_{-1} \\, \\sum_{n=0}^1 \\frac{1}{n+1} \\,b_{n+1}\\, L_J^{n+1} \n+ b_{-1} \\,  \\sum_{n=0}^1 \\frac{1}{n+1} \\,c_{n+1}\\, L_S^{n+1}\n\\nonumber \\\\ &+&\\left. \\sum_{n,m=0}^1 b_m c_n \\left[ L_J^{\\alpha} \\,L_S^{\\beta} \\,\\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)}{\\Gamma(1+\\alpha+\\beta)}\\right] \\bigg|_{\\alpha^m,\\beta^n}\\right\\}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe vertical bar in the last term indicates that we should take the $\\alpha^m \\beta^n$ coefficient of the series expansion of the bracketed term.  We have introduced the abbreviations\n\\begin{equation}\nL_J = \\text{ln} \\left( \\frac{{\\cal T}_1^{cut} Q^2}{\\mu^2}\\right), \\;\\;\\; L_S = \\text{ln} \\left( \\frac{{\\cal T}_1^{cut} Q}{\\mu}\\right).\n\\end{equation}\nUsing these results it is straightforward to analytically compute all of the necessary hadronic integrals in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:belowcutexp}).  The remaining integrals are over the Born phase space and parton distribution functions, and are simple to perform numerically.   This completes the calculation of the ${\\cal T}_1 < {\\cal T}_1^{cut}$ phase space region.  We note that the cross section below ${\\cal T}_1^{cut}$ will contain terms of the form $\\text{ln}^n ({\\cal T}_1^{cut})$, where $n$ ranges from 0 to 4 at NNLO.  An important check of this framework is the cancellation of these terms against the identical logarithms that appear for ${\\cal T}_1 > {\\cal T}_1^{cut}$.  We must also choose ${\\cal T}_1^{cut}$ small enough to avoid the power corrections in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCETfac}) that go as ${\\cal T}_1^{cut}/Q$. Both of these issues will be addressed in our later section on numerical results.\n\n\\subsubsection{Above ${\\cal T}_1^{cut}$}\n\nWe now briefly outline the computation of the quark-lepton channel in the phase space region ${\\cal T}_1 > {\\cal T}_1^{cut}$.    As discussed above this can be obtained from a NLO calculation of the DIS process with an additional jet.  In addition to the virtual corrections to the $q\\,l \\to q\\,l\\,g$ partonic process, there are numerous radiation processes that also contribute: $q\\,l \\to q\\,l\\,g\\,g$,  $q\\,l \\to q\\,l\\,q'\\,\\bar{q}'$ and $q\\,l \\to q\\,l\\,q\\,\\bar{q}$.  In addition to the usual ultraviolet renormalization of the strong coupling constant, the real and virtual corrections are separately infrared divergent.  Remaining divergences after introducing an NLO subtraction scheme are associated with initial-state collinear singularities, and are handled via \nmass factorization.\n\n\\section{Validation and numerical results} \\label{sec:numerics}\n\nWe have implemented the NNLO cross section of Eq.~(\\ref{eq:hxsecnnlo}), as well as the LO and NLO results of Eqs.~(\\ref{eq:sigLO}) and~(\\ref{eq:hxsecnlo}) in a numerical code {\\tt DISTRESS} that allows for arbitrary cuts to be imposed on the final-state lepton and jets.  We describe below the checks we have performed on our calculation.\n\nThe antennae subtraction method provides an analytic cancellation of the $1/\\epsilon$ poles that appear in an NLO calculation.  We are therefore able to check this cancellation of poles for all components computed in this way.  This includes the entire $\\sigma_{\\rm NLO}$, as well as the following contributions to the NNLO hadronic cross section: ${\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{g\\gamma}^{(1,2)}$ and ${\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{q\\gamma}^{(1,2)}$.  The various contributions ${\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{ij}^{(0,2)}$ that occur in $\\sigma_{\\rm NNLO}$ are finite, and simple to obtain.  Our NLO results for the transverse momentum distribution and pseudorapidity distribution of the leading jet are compared against the plots of Ref.~\\cite{Hinderer:2015hra}.  We find good agreement with these results.\n\nThis leaves only the validation of the ${\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{gl}^{(2,2)}$ and ${\\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}_{ql}^{(2,2)}$ contributions, which both utilize the $N$-jettiness subtraction technique.  There are two primary checks that these pieces must satisfy.  First, they must be independent of the parameter ${\\cal T}_N^{cut}$.  This checks the implementation of the beam, jet and soft functions, which have logarithmic dependence on this parameter.  It also determines the range of ${\\cal T}_N^{cut}$ for which the power corrections denoted by the ellipsis in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCETfac}) are negligibly small.  Second, upon integration over the final-state hadronic phase space we must reproduce the NNLO structure functions first determined in Ref.~\\cite{Zijlstra:1992qd}.  This is an extremely powerful check on our calculation, which essentially cannot be passed if any contribution is implemented incorrectly.\n\nWe show in Fig.~\\ref{fig:valid} the results of these checks for the $ql$ and $gl$ scattering channels.  We have set the total center-of-mass energy of the lepton-proton collision to 100 GeV.  For the purpose of this validation check only we have imposed the phase-space cut $Q^2>100$ GeV$^2$, and have integrated inclusively over the hadronic phase space.  We have equated the renormalization and factorization scales to the common value $\\mu=Q$, and have used the CT14 NNLO parton distribution functions~\\cite{Dulat:2015mca}.  ${\\cal T}_1^{cut}$ has been varied from $5 \\times 10^{-6}$ to $1 \\times 10^{-4}$, and the ratio of the NNLO correction to the LO result for the cross section is shown.  The solid lines show the prediction of the inclusive structure function.  We first note that correction is extremely small, less than 1\\% of the leading-order result.  Nevertheless we have excellent numerical control over the NNLO coefficient, as indicated by the vertical error bars.  Our numerical error on the NNLO coefficient is at the percent-level, sufficient for 0.01\\% precision on the total cross section.  The $N$-jettiness prediction for the $ql$ scattering channel is independent of ${\\cal T}_1^{cut}$ over the studied range, while the $gl$ scattering channel is independent of ${\\cal T}_1^{cut}$ for ${\\cal T}_1^{cut} < 10^{-5}$. Both channels are in excellent agreement with the structure-function result.  We have also checked bin-by-bin that the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity distributions of the jet have no dependence on ${\\cal T}_1^{cut}$.  \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.6in]{valid.pdf}%\n\\caption{Plot of the NNLO corrections normalized to the LO cross section for the quark-lepton and gluon-lepton scattering channels as a function of ${\\cal T}_1^{cut}$.  The points denote values obtained from $N$-jettiness subtraction, with the vertical error bars denoting the numerical errors, while the solid lines indicate the inclusive structure function result. } \\label{fig:valid}\n\\end{figure} \n\nHaving established the validity of our calculation we present phenomenological results for proposed EIC run parameters.  We set the collider energy to $\\sqrt{s}=100$ GeV and study the inclusive-jet transverse momentum and pseudorapidity distributions in the range $p_T^{jet}>5$ GeV and $|\\eta_{jet}|<2$.  We use the CT14 parton distribution set~\\cite{Dulat:2015mca} extracted to NNLO in QCD perturbation theory.  We reconstruct jets using the anti-$k_t$ algorithm~\\cite{Cacciari:2008gp} with radius parameter $R=0.5$.  Our central scale choice for both the renormalization and factorization scales is $\\mu=p_T^{jet}$.  To estimate the theoretical errors from missing higher-order corrections we vary the scale around its central value by a factor of two.  The transverse momentum distributions at LO, NLO and NNLO are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:ptj}.  The $K$-factors, defined as the ratios of higher order over lower order cross sections, are shown in the lower panel of this figure.  The NNLO corrections are small in the region $p_T^{jet}>10$ GeV , changing the NLO result by no more than 10\\% over the studied $p_T^{jet}$ region.  The shift of the NLO cross section is slightly positive in the low transverse momentum region, and become less than unity at high-$p_T^{jet}$.  Both the NNLO corrections and the scale dependence grow large at low-$p_T^{jet}$.  The large scale dependence arises primarily from the partonic channels $qq$ and $gq$.  These channels are effectively treated at leading order in our calculation, since they first appear at ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s^2)$, and they are evaluated at the low scale $\\mu=p_T^{jet}/2$ in our estimate of the theoretical uncertainty.  It is therefore not surprising that their uncertainty dominates at low-$p_T^{jet}$  These channels do not contribute at NLO, and consequently the NLO scale uncertainty is smaller.  This is an example of the potential pitfalls in using the scale uncertainty as an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty.  Only an explicit calculation can reveal qualitatively new effects that occur at higher orders in perturbation theory. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.65in]{ptj.pdf}%\n\\caption{Plot of the inclusive-jet transverse momentum distribution at LO, NLO and NNLO in QCD perturbation theory.  The upper panel shows the distributions with scale uncertainties, while the lower panel shows the $K$-factors for the central scale choice.} \\label{fig:ptj}\n\\end{figure} \n\nWe next show the pseudorapidity distribution in Fig.~\\ref{fig:etaj}, with the restriction $p_T^{jet}>10$ GeV.  There are a few surprising aspects present in the NNLO corrections.  First, the scale dependence at NNLO in the region $\\eta_{jet}<0$ is larger than the corresponding NLO scale variation.  Although the corrections are near unity over most of the studied pseudorapidity range, they become sizable near $\\eta_{jet} \\approx 2$, reducing the NLO rate by nearly 50\\%.  To determine the origin of these effects we show in Fig.~\\ref{fig:eta_breakdown_muv} the breakdown of the NNLO correction into its separate partonic channels. This reveals that the total NNLO correction comes from an intricate interplay between all contributing channels, with different ones dominating in different $\\eta_{jet}$ regions.  Only the gluon-lepton partonic process is negligible over all of phase space.  For negative $\\eta_{jet}$, the dominant contribution is given by the quark-quark process.  As discussed before, this appears first at ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s^2)$.  It is therefore effectively treated at leading-order in our calculation, and consequently has a large scale dependence.  We note that the quark-in-lepton distribution from Eq.~(\\ref{eq:qinl}) is larger at high-$x$ than the corresponding photon-in-lepton one, leading to this channel being larger in the negative $\\eta_{jet}$ region.  At high $\\eta_{jet}$, the distribution receives sizable contributions from the gluon-photon process.  No single partonic channel furnishes a good approximation to the shape of the full NNLO correction.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.65in]{etaj.pdf}%\n\\caption{Plot of the inclusive-jet pseudorapidity distribution at LO, NLO and NNLO in QCD perturbation theory.  The upper panel shows the distributions with scale uncertainties, while the lower panel shows the $K$-factors for the central scale choice.} \\label{fig:etaj}\n\\end{figure} \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.65in]{eta_breakdown_muv.pdf}%\n\\caption{Breakdown of the NNLO correction to the $\\eta_{jet}$ distribution into its constituent partonic channels, as a ratio to the full NLO cross section in the bin under consideration.  Also shown is the total result obtained by summing all channels. The bands indicate the scale variation. } \\label{fig:eta_breakdown_muv}\n\\end{figure} \n\n\\section{Conclusions} \\label{sec:conc}\n\nWe have presented in this paper the full calculation of the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2 \\alpha_s^2)$ perturbative corrections to jet production in electron-nucleus collisions.  To obtain this result we have utilized the $N$-jettiness subtraction scheme introduced to allow NNLO calculations in hadronic collisions.   We have described the application of this method to inclusive jet production in detail, and have shown that upon integration over the final-state hadronic phase that we reproduce the known NNLO result for the inclusive structure functions.  Our results have been implemented in a numerical program {\\tt DISTRESS} that we plan to make publicly available for future phenomenological studies.\n\nWe have shown numerical results for jet production at a proposed future EIC. Several new partonic channels appear at the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2 \\alpha_s^2)$ level, which have an important effect on the kinematic distributions of the jet.  No single partonic channel furnishes a good approximation to the full NNLO result.  The magnitude of the corrections we find indicate that higher-order predictions will be an important part of achieving the precision understanding of proton structure desired at the EIC, and we expect that the methods described here will be an integral part of achieving this goal.\n\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n\\noindent\n\\mysection{Acknowledgements}\n\nG.~A. is supported by the NSF grant PHY-1520916.

{"text": "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\n\nCompact stars have a large number of pulsation modes that have been extensively studied since the seminal work of Chandrasekhar on radial oscillations \\cite{APJ140:417:1964,PRL12:114:1964}. In general, these modes are very difficult to observe in the electromagnetic spectrum; therefore most efforts have concentrated on gravitational wave asteroseismology in order to characterise the frequency and damping times of the modes that emit gravitational radiation. In particular, various works focused on the oscillatory properties of  pure hadronic stars, hybrid stars and strange quark stars trying to find signatures of the equation of state of high density neutron star matter  (see \\cite{AA325:217:1997,IJMPD07:29:1998,AA366:565:2001,APJ579:374:2002,PRD82:063006:2010,EL105:39001:2014} and references therein).\n\nMore recently, compact star oscillations have attracted the attention in the context of Soft Gamma ray Repeaters (SGRs), which are persistent X-ray emitters that sporadically emit short bursts of soft $\\gamma$-rays. In the quiescent state, SGRs have an X-ray luminosity of $\\sim 10^{35}$ erg/s, while during the short $\\gamma$-bursts they release up to $10^{42}$ erg/s in episodes of about 0.1 s.   Exceptionally, some  of them have emitted very energetic giant flares which commenced with brief $\\gamma$-ray spikes of $\\sim 0.2$ s, followed by tails lasting hundreds of seconds. Hard spectra (up to 1 MeV) were observed during the spike and the hard X-ray emission of the tail gradually faded modulated at the neutron star (NS) rotation period. The analysis of X-ray data of the tails of the giant flares of SGR 0526-66, SGR 1900+14 and SGR 1806-20 revealed the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)  with frequencies ranging from $\\sim$ 18 to 1840  Hz \\cite{APJ628:L53:2005,APJ632:L111:2005,AA528:A45:2011}. There are also candidate QPOs at higher frequencies up to $\\sim 4$ kHz in other bursts but with lower statistical significance \\cite{ElMezeini2010}; in fact, according to a more recent analysis only one burst shows a marginally significant signal at a frequency of around 3706 Hz \\cite{Huppenkothen2013}. \n \nSeveral characteristics of SGRs are usually explained in terms of the \\textit{magnetar} model, assuming that the object is a neutron star with an unusually strong magnetic field ($B \\sim 10^{15} $ G) \\cite{Woods2006}.  In particular, giant flares are associated to catastrophic rearrangements of the magnetic field. Such violent phenomena are expected to excite a variety of oscillation modes in the stellar crust and core. In fact,  recent studies have accounted for magnetic coupling between the crust and the core, and associate QPOs to global magneto-elastic oscillations of highly magnetized neutron stars \\cite{Levin2007,CerdaDuran2009,Colaiuda2012,Gabler2014}. There has also been interest in the possible excitation of low order $f$-modes because of their strong coupling to  potentially detectable gravitational radiation \\cite{Levin2011}. \n\nIn the present paper we focus on radial oscillations of neutron stars permeated by ultra-strong magnetic fields. These modes might be relevant within the magnetar model because they could be excited during the violent events associated with gamma flares. Since they have higher frequencies than the already known QPOs, they cannot be directly linked to them at present. However, it is relevant to know all the variety of pulsation modes of strongly magnetized neutron stars because the number of observations is still small and new features could emerge in future flares' data. \nOn the other hand, in the case of rotating objects we can expect  some amount of gravitational radiation from even the lowest ($l = 0$) quasi-radial mode \\cite{Stergioulas2003,Passamonti2006} making them potentially relevant for  gravitational wave astronomy.\n\n\n\n\\section{Equations of state}\n\\label{sec2}\n\n\\subsection{Hadronic phase under a magnetic field}\n\\label{sec:A}\n\nIn this section we present an overview of the hadronic equations of state (EOS) used in this work. We describe hadronic matter within the framework of the relativistic non-linear Walecka (NLW) model \\cite{WALECKA1986}. In this model we employ a field-theoretical approach in which the baryons interact via the exchange of $\\sigma-\\omega-\\rho$ mesons in the presence of a magnetic field $B$ along the $z-$axis. The total lagrangian density reads:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{lt}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{H}=\\sum_{b}\\mathcal{L}_{b}+\\mathcal{L}_{m}+\\sum_{l}\\mathcal{L}_{l}+\\mathcal{L}_B\\,.\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{b}$, $\\mathcal{L}_{m}$, $\\mathcal{L}_{l}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{B}$ are the baryons, mesons, leptons and electromagnetic field Lagrangians, respectively, and are given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{b} &=& \\overline{\\psi}_{b}\\left(i\\gamma_{\\mu}\\partial^{\\mu}-q_{b}\\gamma_{\\mu}A^{\\mu}-m_{b}+g_{\\sigma b}\\sigma \\right. \\nonumber \\\\\n    && \\left. -g_{\\omega b}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\omega^{\\mu}-g_{\\rho b}\\tau_{3b}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\rho^{\\mu}\\right)\\psi_{b}\\,,  \\\\\n   \\mathcal{L}_{m} &=& \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma\\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma-m_{\\sigma}^{2}\\sigma^{2})-U(\\sigma)+\n    \\tfrac{1}{2}m_{\\omega}^{2}\\omega_{\\mu}\\omega^{\\mu} \\nonumber \\\\\n   && -\\tfrac{1}{4}\\Omega_{\\mu\\nu}\\Omega^{\\mu\\nu}+\n    \\tfrac{1}{2}m_{\\rho}^{2}\\vec{\\rho}_{\\mu}\\cdot\\vec{\\rho}_{\\mu}-\\tfrac{1}{4}P^{\\mu\\nu}P_{\\mu\\nu} \\,,   \\\\\n    \\mathcal{L}_{l} &=& \\overline{\\psi}_{l}\\left(i\\gamma_{\\mu}\\partial^{\\mu}-q_{l}\\gamma_{\\mu}A^{\\mu}-m_{l}\\right)\\psi_{l} \\,,   \\\\\n    \\mathcal{L}_{B} &=& -\\tfrac{1}{4}F^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu} \\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere he $b$-sum runs over the baryonic octet $b\\equiv N~(p,~n),~\\Lambda,~\\Sigma^{\\pm,0},~\\Xi^{-,0}$, $\\psi_{b}$ is the corresponding baryon Dirac field, whose interactions are mediated by the $\\sigma$ scalar, $\\omega_{\\mu}$ isoscalar-vector and $\\rho_{\\mu}$ isovector-vector meson fields. The baryon charge, baryon mass and isospin projection are denoted by $q_{b}$, $m_{b}$ and $\\tau_{3b}$, respectively, and the masses of the mesons are $ m_{\\sigma}= 512~$ MeV, $m_{\\omega}=783~$MeV and $m_{\\rho}=770~$MeV. The strong interaction couplings of the nucleons with the meson fields are denoted by $g_{\\sigma N}=8.910$, $g_{\\omega N}=10.610$ and $g_{\\rho N}=8.196$. We consider that  the couplings of the hyperons with the meson fields are fractions of those of the nucleons, defining $g_{iH}=X_{iH}g_{iN}$, where the values of $X_{iH}$ are chosen as $X_{\\sigma H}=0.700$ and $X_{\\omega H}=X_{\\rho H}=0.783$ \\cite{GLENDENNING2000}.\n The term $U(\\sigma)=\\frac{1}{3}\\,bm_{n}(g_{\\sigma N}\\sigma)^{3}-\\frac{1}{4}\\,c(g_{\\sigma N}\\sigma)^{4}$ denotes the scalar self-interactions \\cite{NPA292:413:1977,PLB114:392:1982,AJ293:470:1985}, with\n $c=-0.001070$ and $b=0.002947$. The mesonic and electromagnetic field tensors are given by their usual expressions $\\Omega_{\\mu\\nu}=\\partial_{\\mu}\\omega_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu}\\omega_{\\mu}$, ${\\bf P}_{\\mu\\nu}=\\partial_{\\mu}\\vec{\\rho}_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu}\\vec{\\rho}_{\\mu}-g_{\\rho b}(\\vec{\\rho}_{\\mu}\\times\\vec{\\rho}_{\\nu})$ and $F_{\\mu\\nu}=\\partial_{\\mu}A_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu}A_{\\mu}$. The $l$-sum runs over the two lightest leptons $l\\equiv e,\\mu$ and $\\psi_{l}$ is the lepton Dirac field.\nThe symmetric nuclear matter properties at saturation density adopted in this work are given by the GM1 parametrization \\cite{PRL67:2414:1991}, with compressibility $K=300$ MeV, binding energy $B/A=-16.3$ MeV, symmetry energy $a_{sym}=32.5$ MeV, slope $L=94$ MeV, saturation density $\\rho_{0}= 0.153$ fm$^{-3}$ and nucleon mass $m=938$ MeV.\n\nThe following equations present the scalar and vector densities for the charged and uncharged baryons \\cite{JPG36:115204:2009,PRC89:015805:2014}, respectively:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n&\\label{densities1}\\rho_{b}^{s}=\\frac{|q_{b}|B \\bar{m}_{b} }{2\\pi^{2}}\\sum_{\\nu}^{\\nu_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\sum_{s}\\frac{\\bar{m}_{b}^{c}}{\\sqrt{ \\bar{m}_{b}^2    + 2\\nu |q_{b}|B}}   \\ln\\bigg|\\frac{k_{F,\\nu,s}^{\\,b}+E_{F}^{\\,b}}{\\bar{m}_{b}^{c}} \\bigg|,\\\\\n&\\label{densities2}\\rho_{b}^{v}=\\frac{|q_{b}|B}{2\\pi^{2}}\\sum_{\\nu}^{\\nu_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\sum_{s}k_{F,\\nu,s}^{\\,b},\\\\\n&\\label{densities3}\\rho_{b}^{s}=\\frac{\\bar{m}_{b}}{4\\pi^{2}}\\sum_{s}\\bigg[E_{F}^{\\,b}k_{F,s}^{\\,b}-\\bar{m}_{b}^{2}\\ln\\bigg|\\frac{k_{F,s}^{\\,b}+E_{F}^{\\,b}}{\\bar{m}_{b}}\\bigg|\\bigg] ,\\\\\n&\\label{densities4}\\rho_{b}^{v}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi^{2}}\\sum_{s}\\bigg[\\frac{1}{3}(k_{F,s}^{\\,b})^{3}\\bigg] ,\n\\end{eqnarray}\n %\n where $\\bar{m}_{b}=m_{b}-g_{\\sigma}\\sigma$ and $\\bar{m}_{b}^{c}=\\sqrt{ \\bar{m}_{b}^2 + 2\\nu |q_{b}|B}$.  $\\nu=n+\\frac{1}{2}-$sgn$(q_{b})\\frac{s}{2}=0,1,2,...$ are the Landau levels for the fermions with electric charge $q_{b}$, $s$ is the spin and assumes values\n$+1$ for spin up and $-1$ for spin down cases.\n\n\nThe energy spectra for the baryons are given by \\cite{JPG35:125201:2008,APJ537:351:2000}:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{energy}\nE_{\\nu,s}^{\\,b}=\\sqrt{(k_{z}^{\\,b})^{2}+\\bar{m}_{b}^{2}+2\\nu |q_{b}|B}+g_{\\omega b}\\omega^{0}+\\tau_{3b}g_{\\rho b}\\rho^{0}\\\\\nE_{s}^{\\,b}=\\sqrt{(k_{z}^{\\,b})^{2}+\\bar{m}_{b}^{2}+(k_{\\perp}^{\\,b})^{2}}+g_{\\omega b}\\omega^{0}+\\tau_{3b}g_{\\rho b}\\rho^{0},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $k_{\\perp}^{\\,b}=k_{x}^{\\,b}+k_{y}^{\\,b}$. The Fermi momenta $k_{F,\\nu,s}^{\\,b}$ of the charged baryons and $k_{F,s}^{\\,b}$ of the uncharged baryons and their relationship with the Fermi energies of the charged baryons $E_{F,\\nu,s}^{\\,b}$ and uncharged baryons $E_{F,s}^{\\,b}$ can be written as:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{Momentum}\n&&(k_{F,\\nu,s}^{\\,b})^{2}=(E_{F,\\nu,s}^{\\,b})^{2}-(\\bar{m}_{b}^{c})^{2} \\\\\n&&(k_{F,s}^{\\,b})^{2}=(E_{F,s}^{\\,b})^{2}-\\bar{m}_{b}^{2}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nFor the leptons, the vector density is given by:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{vector_{density_{leptons}}}\n\\rho_{l}^{v}=\\frac{|q_{l}|B}{2\\pi^{2}}\\sum_{\\nu}^{\\nu_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\sum_{s}k_{F,\\nu,s}^{\\,l}, \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $k_{F,\\nu,s}^{\\,l}$ is the lepton Fermi momentum, which is related to the Fermi energy $E_{F,\\nu,s}^{\\,l}$ by:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{Momentuml}\n(k_{F,\\nu,s}^{\\,l})^{2}=(E_{F,\\nu,s}^{\\,l})^{2}-\\bar{m}_{l}^{2}\\,, \\qquad l=e,\\mu,\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\\noindent with $\\bar{m}_{l}=m_{l}^{2}+2\\nu |q_{l}|B$.

The parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are chosen to reproduce two behaviors of the magnetic field: a fast decay with $\\gamma=3.00$ and $\\beta=0.02$ and a slow decay with $\\gamma=2.00$ and $\\beta=0.05$ \\cite{PRC89:015805:2014}. According to the discussion in the previous subsection, we use two values for the magnetic field $B_{0}$, namely $10^{17}$~G and $3.1\\times10^{18}$~G. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{On the isotropy of the pressure}\n\nNotice that in the previous subsections we assumed that the matter pressure ($P_m + P_l$) is isotropic in spite of the high values of the magnetic field. As it has been shown in Ref. \\cite{JPG41:015203:2014},  the anisotropic effects around $3.1\\times10^{18}$~G are small, thus we restrict ourselves to magnetic fields below this value.\n\nHowever, the purely field-related pressure $P_B \\sim  B^2$ may become dominant in the core of the star. In such cases, the total pressure  perpendicular to the magnetic field lines would be significantly larger than the pressure parallel to the field lines. Therefore,  3D or at least 2D stellar structure equations should be used in order to incorporate the effect of the pressure anisotropy. We must stress however, that the magnetic field geometry inside a neutron star can be extremely complex, and depending on its configuration the use of the spherically symmetric stellar structure equations can still be a good enough approximation, as we argue below. \n\nIf we consider, for example, a purely dipole field (purely poloidal field), a 1D stellar structure calculation would be certainly inappropriate for some very high field objects.  But such configuration is unstable and cannot be realised in Nature; in fact, any neutron star with a purely poloidal or a purely toroidal magnetic field is unstable in general relativity (see \\cite{Ciolfi2011} and references therein). This strongly supports the idea that any long-lived magnetic field configuration in a NS has to consist of a mixture of poloidal and toroidal field components.\nOn the other hand, while stellar shapes have long been considered to be oblate due to the effects of centrifugal and/or magnetic forces, this is not necessarily true. For example, it has been found recently that the shape of our Sun is perfectly round, against the common expectation of an oblate shape due to its rotation \\cite{Kuhn2012}.\n\n\nIn the specific case of neutron stars, the results found thus far are that purely poloidal magnetic fields make stars oblate (equatorial radius larger than polar radius), while purely toroidal magnetic fields lead stars to become prolate (polar radius larger than equatorial radius). Very recently, it has been shown that equilibrium states of magnetized stars with mixed poloidal$-$toroidal magnetic fields are possible; in particular, it was possible to build neutron stars with twisted-torus configurations in equilibria with any toroidal and poloidal field energy content \\cite{Ciolfi2013}. Such poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields act as increasing and decreasing mechanisms for stellar oblateness, respectively \\cite{Fujisawa2013}.\nAn additional finding of Ref. \\cite{Ciolfi2013} is that for a fixed polar magnetic field strength, a higher relative content of toroidal field energy ($> 10 \\%$) implies in general a much higher total (poloidal and toroidal) magnetic energy inside the star. This means that a  highly magnetized neutron star can harbor internal magnetic fields that are significantly stronger than commonly expected.\n\n\nIn addition, a very complex field is expected from the formation process of magnetized neutron stars, since they are born hot, highly convective and differentially rotating  \\cite{Thompson1996,Bonanno2003}. During its early evolution,  neutron star's magnetic fields can be significantly amplified and redistributed by several mechanisms including possibly dynamo action and shear instabilities. In this context, a distribution of magnetic energy with poloidal and toroidal fields close to equipartition appears as a very reasonable candidate for the internal magnetic field configuration. In such a case, since both the toroidal and poloidal components are of  the same order, we may expect that oblateness and prolateness cancel out approximately, leading to stars close to the spherical symmetry. Since a study of stellar pulsations in 2D or 3D is numerically involving, we shall adopt spherical symmetry as a first approximation, and use the much more simple 1D equations. \nWithin this approach, we must add to the matter pressure ($P_m + P_l$) given in Sec. \\ref{sec:A},  an effective mean magnetic pressure $P_B$ representing the effective isotropic contribution arising from the combined effect of poloidal and toroidal field components of the same order. \nThus, the total energy density and the total pressure of the system read:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{et}\n\\varepsilon & = & \\varepsilon_{m}+\\varepsilon_{l} + \\tfrac{1}{2}  \\left[B\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_{0}} \\right)\\right]^{2} , \\\\\nP & = & P_{m}+P_{l} + P_B  .\\label{et222}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nFor finding the effective mean magnetic pressure $P_B$ we shall follow here an averaging procedure similar to the one employed in works that focus on the study of magnetic fluctuations in turbulent fluids \\cite{Brandenburg2012,Rogachevskii2007}.  The magnetic stress tensor $\\sigma_{ij}$ is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\sigma_{ij} = - \\frac{\\langle {\\bf B}^2 \\rangle}{2}  \\delta_{ij} + \\langle B_i B_j \\rangle , \n\\label{stress_tensor}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $ \\delta_{ij} $ is the Kronecker tensor and the brackets $ \\langle \\cdots \\rangle$  denote the averaging. \nFor a completely isotropic distribution of the magnetic field we have $\\langle B_i B_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij} \\, \\langle {\\bf B}^2 \\rangle / 3 $, and the magnetic stress tensor reads\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\sigma_{ij}= - {\\langle {\\bf B}^2 \\rangle \\over 6} \\, \\delta_{ij} \n\\label{I2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe effective mean magnetic pressure $P_B$ is related to the magnetic stress tensor by $\\sigma_{ij} = - P_B \\,\n\\delta_{ij}$.  Therefore,  we find:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nP_{B} =   \\tfrac{1}{6}  \\left[B\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_{0}} \\right)\\right]^{2}  .\n\\label{WA1}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nA similar expression has been used in  \\cite{Bednarek2003} for studying the influence of asymmetry on a magnetized proto-neutron star.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Radial Oscillations}\n\nIn order to study the radial oscillations of a compact star, we must know first its equilibrium configuration.  Such configuration is perturbed in such a way that the spherical symmetry of the body is not violated. The space-time and fluid perturbations are inserted into the Einstein equations and into the energy, momentum and baryon number conservation equations, assuming a sinusoidal time dependence $\\exp{(i \\omega t)}$ and retaining only the first-order terms. The result of this procedure is a second order ordinary differential equation for the perturbations \\cite{APJ140:417:1964} or alternatively a set of two first order ordinary differential equations, as shown below. In the following we present the explicit form of the equilibrium and oscillation equations employed in the present work. \n\n\\subsection{Equilibrium configuration}\n\\label{sec3}\n\nWe consider that the unperturbed  compact star is totally composed of a perfect fluid. In this case the stress-energy momentum tensor can be expressed as \n\\begin{equation}\n{T}_{\\mu\\nu} =(\\epsilon + p) u_{\\mu}u_{\\nu} + p{g}_{\\mu\\nu},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\epsilon$ and $p$ are the energy density and pressure respectively.\n\nThe  background spacetime of the spherically symmetric star,  can be expressed through the line element\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{dsz_tov}\nds^{2}=-e^{ \\nu(r)} dt^{2} + e^{ \\lambda(r)} dr^{2} + r^{2}(d\\theta^{2}+\\sin^{2}{\\theta}d\\phi^{2}),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $t,r,\\theta,\\phi$ are the set of Schwarzschild-like coordinates, and the metric potentials $\\nu(r)$ and $\\lambda(r)$ are functions of the radial coordinate $r$ only.\n\nThe Einstein equations in such a spacetime lead to the following set of stellar structure equations (Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations)\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{dm}{dr} = 4 \\pi r^2 \\epsilon,  \\\\\n\\frac{d\\nu}{dr} = - \\frac{2}{\\epsilon} \\frac{dp}{dr} \t\\bigg(1 + \\frac{p}{\\epsilon}\\bigg)^{-1},   \\\\\n\\frac{dp}{dr} = - \\frac{\\epsilon m}{r^2}\\bigg(1 + \\frac{p}{\\epsilon}\\bigg) \\bigg(1 + \\frac{4\\pi p r^3}{m}\\bigg)\\bigg(1 - \\frac{2m}{r}\\bigg)^{-1},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $m$ is the gravitational mass inside the radius $r$.\n\nThe metric function $\\nu$ has the following boundary condition\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{BoundaryConditionMetricFunction}\n    \\nu(r=R)= \\ln \\bigg( 1-\\frac{2M}{R} \\bigg),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $R$ is the radius of the star and $M$ its mass. With this condition the metric function $\\nu$  will match smoothly to the Schwarzschild metric outside the star. The boundary conditions for $m$ and $p$ are $m(r=0) = 0$ and $p(r=R) = 0$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,scale=0.66]{fig1.eps}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,scale=0.66]{fig2.eps} \n\\includegraphics[angle=0,scale=0.66]{fig3.eps}\n\\caption{The period of the fundamental mode of hadronic stars as a function of (a)  the  mass $M$, (b) the gravitational redshift $Z$, and (c) the central energy density $\\epsilon_c$.

In this work, we use the set of equations of Gondek et al. \\cite{AA325:217:1997} and adopt $G = c = 1$. The equations read \n\\begin{eqnarray} \\label{ecuacionparaXI}\n\\frac{d\\xi}{dr} &=& -\\frac{1}{r}\\bigg(3\\xi+\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Gamma p}\\bigg)-\\frac{dp}{dr}\\frac{\\xi}{(p+\\epsilon)},   \\\\\n \\label{ecuacionparaP}\n\\frac{d\\Delta p}{dr} &=& \\xi \\bigg\\{\\omega^{2}e^{\\lambda-\\nu}(p+\\epsilon)r-4\\frac{dp}{dr} \\bigg \\}  \\nonumber \\\\  \n&& +\\xi\\bigg \\{\\bigg(\\frac{dp}{dr}\\bigg)^{2}\\frac{r}{(p+\\epsilon)}-8\\pi e^{\\lambda}(p+\\epsilon)pr \\bigg \\}   \\nonumber \\\\ \n&& +\\Delta p\\bigg \\{\\frac{dp}{dr}\\frac{1}{(p+\\epsilon)} - 4\\pi(p+\\epsilon)r e^{\\lambda}\\bigg\\},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\omega$ is the eigenfrequency and the quantities $\\xi \\equiv \\Delta r / r$ and $\\Delta p$ are assumed to have a harmonic time dependence $\\varpropto e^{i\\omega t}$.\n\n\nTo solve equations (\\ref{ecuacionparaXI}) and (\\ref{ecuacionparaP}) one needs two boundary conditions.\nThe  condition of regularity at the centre ($r=0$) can be written as \\cite{AA260:250:1992,AA325:217:1997,AA344:117:1999}\n\\begin{equation}\\label{DeltaP}\n(\\Delta p)_{center}=-3(\\xi \\Gamma p)_{center}.\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the eigenfunctions are normalized in order to have $\\xi(0)=1$.  The second boundary condition, expresses the fact that the Lagrangian perturbation in the pressure at the  stellar surface is zero, thus:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{PenSuperficie}\n(\\Delta p)_{surface}=0.\n\\end{equation}\n\nTo solve numerically the oscillation equations  we employ a shooting method in order to fulfil  the required boundary conditions. For more details on the method see Ref. \\cite{PRD82:063006:2010}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Results and conclusions}\n\n\n\nIn this section we analyse the effect that a strong magnetic field could produce on  the fundamental mode of the radial oscillations of hadronic stars. As mentioned before, we consider that the magnetic field decays with the density following the fast and slow profiles presented  in Section \\ref{B-density-depndence}. All the models for hadronic stars investigated in the present work have a maximum mass in agreement with the recent observation of the pulsars PSR J1614-2230 with $M = (1.97 \\pm 0.04) M_{\\odot}$ \\cite{Demorest2010} and  PSR J0348-0432 with $M = (2.01 \\pm 0.04) M_{\\odot}$ \\cite{Antoniadis2013}. \n\n\n\nIn Fig. \\ref{fig1} we see that a magnetic field profile with $B_0 = 10^{17}$ G, produces very small changes  on the oscillation period of the fundamental mode with respect to an unmagnetized star, for both slow and fast decays. This can be explained by the small effect that such magnetic field intensity has on the equation of state. \nIn contrast, when $B_0 = 3.1 \\times 10^{18}$ G is selected, there is a clear change in the oscillation period.  As a function of the stellar mass, the curves fall below and to the right of the curves for weaker fields. Notice that for large mass objects the period changes because of the  shift of the curves due to the increase of the maximum stellar mass. For smaller masses, the curves for  $B_0 = 3.1 \\times 10^{18}$ G are also significantly different with respect to the unmagnetized case; e.g. for a neutron star with $1.4 M_{\\odot}$  the period is around $20 \\%$ smaller, and the difference increases for less massive stars. For completeness we present also  the oscillation period  as a function of the gravitational redshift  (see middle panel of Fig. \\ref{fig1}) and  as a function of the central mass-energy density  (lower panel of Fig. \\ref{fig1}). \n\nThe effect of strong magnetic fields is more apparent in the frequency of the fundamental mode as can be seen in Fig. \\ref{fig2}. The oscillation frequency for $B_0 = 10^{17}$ G is slightly above the one of an unmagnetized object of the same mass, and there is almost no difference between the fast and the slow decaying profiles of the magnetic field. However, if $B_0 = 3.1 \\times 10^{18}$ G the oscillation frequencies are clearly larger than for an unmagnetized star of the same mass. For example, for a star with $1.4 M_{\\odot}$  the frequency is around $20 \\%$ larger and for a  $1.7 M_{\\odot}$ star it is around $10 \\%$ larger. The difference between the fast and the slow decaying profiles of $B$ is very small.\n\n\nAs stated before, purely radial modes do not emit gravitational waves and consequently they are essentially damped by the bulk viscosity, \noriginated from the re-establishment of chemical equilibrium when a fluid element of the star is compressed and rarified during pulsations. \nUnfortunately, there is great uncertainty about the amount of viscosity inside neutron stars since it depends sensitively on the composition of matter which is uncertain beyond few times the nuclear saturation density \n\\cite{Jones2001,Lindblom2002,Haensel2002,Chatterjee2007,Jha2010}.  If the damping time due to viscous forces is long enough, radial pulsations in magnetars can leave an imprint in the microstucture of magnetar flare lightcurves opening a new window for the study of highly magnetized ultradense matter.\n \n\n\n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nL.
